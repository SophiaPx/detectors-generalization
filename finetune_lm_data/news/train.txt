The Spanish ambassador to the UK has been summoned by the Foreign Office after one of the country’s research vessels entered British territory off the coast of Gibraltar. Foreign Office minister David Lidington said the actions of the research ship, which was accompanied by a Spanish Civil Guard vessel, were 'unlawful'. ‘According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the waters around Gibraltar are indisputably British territorial waters, under United Kingdom sovereignty, in which only the United Kingdom has the right to exercise jurisdiction,’ Mr Lidington told the Telegraph.
This month, Gavekal published "Our Top 12 Questions for 2017." The first question in their list is one of the most important: Will the US dollar continue its strong rally? This is the most important question for 2017. So many other things hinge on what happens to the dollar this year. Charles and Anatole both think the dollar rally will continue, though Anatole thinks it will not strengthen against the euro. Louis has a more nuanced opinion, which I'll quote in full. It all depends on what happens to return on invested capital.
Hogan & Hartson attorney Ted Trimpa smiles after a press conference announcing a successful negotiation for a deal with organized labor over pulling several proposed amendments off the statewide ballot after a press conference announcing the deal Thursday in downtown Denver. About a month ago, software millionaire Tim Gill asked his political adviser, Ted Trimpa, to see what he could do to help quell a looming ballot battle between business and labor. • Mitch Ackerman, president of Service Employees International Union Colorado. • Lynne Mason, who handles government relations for the Colorado Education Association.
The Brooks project is the first of several renewable energy projects to be constructed in Alberta as the province shifts away from coal power plants. There usually isn't much to look at driving the Trans-Canada Highway through southeast Alberta, aside from the occasional bobbing pumpjack, the odd herd of cattle and the abundance of brown prairie grass. That's one reason why a new solar project outside the city of Brooks is so jarring. Seeing the 30-hectare site filled with solar panels is not only a sharp contrast to the landscape, but also to the province and its massive oil and gas industry.
Talawanda High School junior Terell Wills talks about his two-way skills, the Braves? ? 2018 aspirations and a Week 2 road game against Badin on Friday at Hamilton. A two-game winning streak may be modest by most standards, but it’s a big deal for Talawanda High School’s football team. Talawanda avoided a winless season in 2017 by earning a 10-8 victory in the finale against Ross, then opened up this year by handling Preble Shawnee 34-12 last week. The last time the Braves won two in a row? They won five straight to end the regular season in 2014.
Acclaimed UK indie quartet Wild Beasts are aware they risk dividing fans and critics with the more aggressive tone of Boy King – a stark departure from previous work. The most unexpected influence on Wild Beasts’s surprising fifth outing? Kanye West. Guitarist Ben Little says incessantly listening to the rapper’s sonically abrasive Yeezus shaped the stripped-back, primal-minded change of direction for his band on Boy King. West is not the first artist you would think of as sharing kinship with Wild Beasts, who are known for their fragile, literate, effervescent indie music.

The flash floods had swift-water rescue teams out in full force, including in Cleburne and Dallas. There were more than 200 rescues in Dallas alone, authorities said. Officials who oversee lakes in North Texas were especially worried about more rainfall. Two flood gates were opened Friday morning at Possum Kingdom Lake, raising concerns about downstream flooding from the Brazos River in Parker County, where much of the Horseshoe Bend neighborhood was already underwater. Lake Grapevine, which was 22.66 feet above capacity Friday afternoon, was expected to pour over the spillway for the first time since 1990, and roads around the lake were being closed.
Parvinder Singh scored an unbeaten century while Bhuvneshwar Kumar missed out on the three-figure mark by nine runs as Uttar Pradesh extended their overall lead to a massive 445 runs against a toothless Karnataka attack in the Ranji Trophy Group B match, in Meerut, on Monday. The duo added 230 runs for the fifth wicket to rescue their team from a precarious 88 for four and ended the third day on a strong 343 for five. Having come together at the fall of Mohammad Kaif's wicket earlier on Monday, the duo showed great determination and did not allow the Karnataka bowlers to dominate the proceedings.
FREDERICK, Md. (AP) | For Elin Ross, cooking came first. It came before college and graduate school, before working in child welfare and the foster care system for the National Youth Advocate Program. She has combined a lifetime of cooking with a career in youth advocacy to create a unique program in downtown Frederick. In the spring, she plans to open a cafe named Moxie, in connection with Cakes for Cause. Cakes for Cause, a nonprofit, will provide job training and support to vulnerable local youth, 16 to 21 years old, growing out of the foster care system.

“Starting a tech company is not what most people from Saskatchewan do,” says the Canadian-born Michelle Zatlyn, co-founder of CloudFlare. Zatlyn, in fact, wanted to be a doctor. But when she considered medical school, she thought, "There’s all of these other things I like doing, too,” she says. So, after working at various companies and graduating from Harvard Business School, Zatlyn and two others—Matthew Prince and Lee Holloway--founded CloudFlare in 2009. The company has been described as a digital bouncer that protects websites from malicious attackers.
Bravo, France! And shame on you, David Cameron! France has offered asylum to the Iraqi Christians forced to flee from Mosul. The BBC reports this, and so does Al Jazeera. “We are in constant contact with local and national authorities to ensure everything is done to protect them,” both ministers said. So, these are not cheap words, or political posturing. Something is actually being done. Bravo, France! You are a secular republic that sees, in true secular fashion, the human needs of people in distress, and wants to do something about it.

In a sea of modern adaptations, sometimes it’s best to get back to the classics. Forget Katniss Everdeen and Harry Potter, it’s about time audiences became reacquainted with the likes of Captain Nemo and his iconic Nautilus.

THE recent strike by a group of bus drivers from China at public transport operator SMRT has polarised public opinion in Singapore. On one side, civil society groups have framed the issue as one of human rights and morality. They have decried the uneven distribution of power between corporations and workers, the unfair wages paid to foreign workers, and the poor conditions they labour under. On the other side, the Government has emphasised the illegality of the drivers' actions, the availability of legitimate channels for workers to voice their grievances, and the country's "zero tolerance" of acts which disrupt industrial harmony.
POWDER, the second novel by KEVIN SAMPSON, former manager of The Farm turned bestselling author, is published on June 24 by Random House, one of the first novels to write about the ups and downs of a rock and roll band from an insider’s perspective.

A drug used to combat the common skin condition psoriasis may help to protect the heart. A new study shows that it can reduce aortic inflammation, a key risk factor for future cardiovascular events. Could a psoriasis drug help to reduce cardiovascular risk? Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory condition, is one of the most common skin disorders in the United States. It affects more than 100 million people worldwide. The skin cells of people with psoriasis multiply faster than normal, which produces raised red bumps on the skin, often on the knees, scalp, and elbows.
Ben & Jerry&apos;s indelible message at AVAM: "Stamp money out of politics." Susan Speirs fed four dollars into the Amend-o-matic Stamp Mobile. After spiraling up the "Tower of Corrupted Power," gliding past a clanging gong and sliding down hairpin turns on a roller coaster-style track to a final stamping station, the bills came out with bright red lettering in all caps. Now, they read, "Stamp money out of politics." That's the message Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield — the Ben and Jerry of ice cream fame — have been spreading through their Stamp Mobile the past three years.
After a report that found the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle is not functionally operational, the company that builds it says most of the issues have been fixed. The vehicle is set to replace many vehicles of the aging Humvee fleet. It is a faster and more ruggedized vehicle built to better protect troops as priorities shift to a more competitive, near-peer battlefield. Its protection, extreme off-road mobility, modularity and network capabilities far exceed the Humvee and provide a suite of capabilities in a smaller, faster package than the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected, or MRAP, vehicles developed to counter roadside bombs that shredded many Humvees.

Facing the specter of a third consecutive series loss and a somber flight to Chicago, the Houston Astros accomplished something on Sunday that appeared wholly improbable. DETROIT -- Ian Kinsler's bloop single to right-center field with two outs scored Jose Iglesias to finish a three-run seventh inning that helped the Detroit Tigers snap a four-game losing streak with a 5-3 victory over the Houston Astros on Saturday. In a season in which he missed two months with injuries, Baltimore Orioles closer Zach Britton still managed to make history. With his bullpen stretched thin following a long but successful weekend in Chicago, Seattle Mariners manager Scott Servais was looking for good effort.

MINNEAPOLIS -- Josh Okogie noted one big difference between the start of his rookie season and the end of it last Saturday in Denver. “I’m a little more sore, I can tell you that,” Okogie said. Call those growing pains. The Timberwolves’ first-round pick experienced plenty of growth this season, developing as a defender, play-maker and decision-maker over the course of his first NBA campaign. Most who watched him would agree, a positive for a franchise that hopes to grow into a consistent contender.

Auckland councillors have voted to bring in a 11.5 cent-a-litre regional fuel tax to fund transport projects after a crunch debate today. Councillors voted 13 to 7 in favour of the tax. Today's debate on the proposed tax began with Mayor Phil Goff saying the consequences would be "inconceivable" if it was not introduced. He said the government would likely walk away from an agreed programme of transport works, if the tax was rejected. Councillor Penny Hulse said the tax had been debated for decades and the lack of action on transport had harmed communities.
A STRAIGHT red card for Marlon King capped a miserable afternoon for Coventry who were booed off. Bristol City were 3-0 up at the break through Nicky Maynard, Lewin Nyatanga and a David Clarkson penalty. Lukas Jutkiewicz replied in the 53rd minute but King’s dismissal after an off-the-ball clash with Damion Stewart ruined hopes of a comeback. The controversial striker had taken the captain’s armband after keeper Keiren Westwood went off at half-time – but he only wore it for 15 minutes. Stunned Coventry boss Aidy Boothroyd said: “Marlon King has gone for a one-two and Stewart caught him with his arm.

efficiency, safety and profitability. As emerging technologies continue to transform these sectors, a focused community of new leaders and innovators is also beginning to emerge. Now is the time to come together as a community of innovators – which is why, on April 12, my team and I launched the first annual Frontier Conference™ (“The Frontier™”) with the two-pronged goal of building a community of leaders and innovators to gather to analyze and solve keys issues related to industrial innovation and the goal of positioning New Orleans as a major hub of emerging technology ventures and ideas.
Thompson Speedway Motorsports Park will increase the number of events on its oval next season. General manager Terry Eames, the former owner and promoter of the New London-Waterford Speedbowl, released the 2019 schedule for the Northeastern Connecticut institution on Tuesday. The track will offer 10 dates, up from seven this past season. Eames, who was officially named the general manager of the track toward the end of the past season, said he didn’t come in with any pre-disposed idea to increase the number of races. However, he attended several events at the track and people began to bend his ear in that direction.
Attorney General Eric Holder testifies during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, on Jan. 29, 2014 in Washington, D.C.
As Attorney General Eric Holder prepares to depart government service after six years, supporters point to his defense of marriage equality and the Voting Rights Act as issues that will define his legacy. But as others have pointed out since the attorney general announced Thursday that he would resign, Holder’s work on civil liberties has been far less inspiring. Holder will leave his successor with the task of explaining and justifying many controversial policies.
A US citizen, who was put on a no-fly list, declared a threat to national security and tortured in an UAE prison after refusing to become an FBI informant, is having a hard time proving it happened at the behest of the US authorities, his lawyer told RT. Yonas Fikre is an Eritrean born American citizen who immigrated as a refugee to the US when he was 13 from neighboring Sudan. He became a US citizen and in 2006 settled in Portland, Oregon. His problems began soon after 2010 when he went back to Khartoum, where he still had relatives, to start an electronics import business.
The managers of two historic Jewish cemeteries in Seattle are asking for the city’s help in preventing desecration and vandalism at the sites. The Jewish community says the issue is groups of homeless people who have set up camp in and around the cemeteries. Ari Hoffman, a vice president of Seattle’s Bikur Cholim Machzikay Hadath Synagogue and a member of its cemetery committee, told the local media that headstones have been defaced and that needles and other discarded drug paraphernalia, as well as human feces, have been found on and among the tombstones.

London’s housing crisis is just the most conspicuous aspect of Britain’s collective failure to meet the demands of urban development. We have moved past the predictable production lines of Henry Ford’s day, but our inability to grasp the chaotic genius of the modern market means we are failing to seize the potential prosperity this change brings. Our communication-intensive new economy is built on professional networking and thrives best in large, dense urban clusters. Most of us feel it in our bones that we must join the central networks and that our careers are incompatible with being cut off in provincial or suburban locations.
A proposed settlement for 15 lawsuits seeking class-action status would see Nvidia pay out $30 per card to GeForce GTX 970 owners. A set of class action lawsuits relating to the controversy around Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 970 graphics card may be resolved soon.

BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - The owner of the SAT college-entrance exam, which has been plagued by a raft of cheating incidents overseas, outlined new security measures but stopped short of remedying the test’s biggest vulnerability. The New York-based College Board said the steps include reducing the number of times the test is given outside the United States and increasing the auditing of test centers. But the not-for-profit organization did not say it would end its practice of reusing test forms overseas that were initially given in the United States - the source of many of its security lapses in recent years.
Lafayette’s massive Railroad Relocation had many champions over 29 years. But without a push from former Sen. Birch Bayh, it might have never happened. Bayh died Thursday at age 91. LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Do the math on the funding Sen. Birch Bayh steered toward Lafayette’s Railroad Relocation Project, a massive effort that rerouted freight and passenger trains and eliminated 42 crossings in downtown and across the city. The amount comes to less than two-tenths of a percent of the $186 million it took to get the job done over nearly three full decades.
A large majority of the players who bought Blizzard’s Starcraft 2 accidentally created a gamertag that they didn’t like at all. How do you accidentally create a gamertag? Starcraft 2 made some big changes to the game and creating your profile name was one of them. In the original Starcraft, players would create a name for the single player campaign and one for the online service known as Battle.net. Profile names for the single player were only seen by you, so often gamers would just type something random so they can begin to play.

Even with SeaWorld’s finances improving, the company laid off an undisclosed number of employees Friday, said a spokeswoman, who called it a move toward greater efficiency. She declined to say in what departments the cuts were made. SeaWorld Entertainment, based in Orlando, has 12 theme parks across the country — including its marque SeaWorld Orlando and sister Aquatica water park as well as Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. On social media, there were unconfirmed reports that the cuts included animal trainers, bird staff and the animal ambassadors who go out into the public to teach about wildlife.
Technology experts such as Elon Musk and scientists of the caliber of Stephen Hawkings are worried about Artificial Intelligence. The fear is that computer and online technology will develop to the point that the machines will become more intelligent than the human beings who made them. When that happens, machines may attain consciousness. Those artificially-intelligent machines might make human life better than ever before. And they might take over the world, viewing humans as unnecessary and primitive parasites to be exterminated. Ellen Duffer has written a provocative article entitled As Artificial Intelligence Advances, What Are its Religious Implications? in Religion & Politics.
Olivia Dow has always reiterated that all kinds of styles are possible if one has the fundamental classical training on board. Her system is very easy to understand. She starts her pupils from the age of three – not in baby classes, but straight into classical ballet curriculum – Legat System (Russian Classical Ballet). When they are strong enough, approximately at age nine or 10, she puts them en pointe. At the same time, she introduces them to character dance and gradually to modern/contemporary through choreographic workshops and finally, jazz.
The new report released by the IPCC has provoked a host of emotions for one journalist and father with the exception of one: despair. Only hope for his daughter and the rest of Generation Hot can deliver us from crisis and into recovery and rejuvenation. We can’t say they didn’t warn us. The report released by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week is only the latest and most dire in a string of scientific declarations leading back to 1988, when NASA scientist James Hansen’s landmark testimony to the United States Senate put man-made global warming on the public agenda.
RIO DE JANEIRO (AFP) - Switzerland's Fabian Cancellara ensured his retirement at the end of the year would be golden by reclaiming the Olympic cycling time-trial title in Rio on Wednesday (Aug 10). The Beijing 2008 champion, who could finish only seventh in London four years ago after being affected by a crash in the road race, was totally dominant as he beat Tom Dumoulin into second with Tour de France champion Chris Froome back in third. Known as Spartacus in the professional cycling peloton, Cancellara was long considered the best time-trialist in the world as he won four world titles.
The Capitol's West Front basks in celebrity, its restoration the subject of perennial debate. But the original East Front has fallen into obscurity--taken apart and scattered around Washington, apparently destined to become an architectural footnote. The East Front portico, built between 1815 and 1829, was dismantled when that side of the Capitol was restored from 1958 to 1962. It was catalogued for possible reassembly, but no decision has ever been made about what to do with it. As a result, its pieces lie about the city, battered by the elements, and in some cases, being carved up into souvenirs.
It’s rare to see evidence of an administration plot to manipulate the media unfolding in real time, but such is the case this week—and thus far, corporate media have taken the bait hook, line, and sinker. The push to announce Iran-related cases has caused internal alarm, these people said, with some law enforcement officials fearing that senior Justice Department officials want to reveal the cases because the Trump administration would like Congress to impose new sanctions on Iran. A series of criminal cases could increase pressure on lawmakers to act, these people said.
Home to the San Diego Zoo, Sea World and more than 70 miles of beaches, both on the ocean and along Mission Bay, San Diego offers visitors a more laid-back experience than a visit to Los Angeles. Several hotels are available in the area, some of which front the warm sands of Pacific Ocean beaches. Looking like a throwback from the glory surfer days of the 1950s, the Surfer Beach Hotel offers 53 guest rooms, 15 junior suites and one Sunset Suite over four floors. The Surfer Beach Hotel is home to the World Famous restaurant, one of San Diego’s most visited dining venues.
Laguins said Georgia's known he'd likely commit to them since late July or early August. However, Laguins said Auburn made a late push to get him and admitted it was tough to turn down the Tigers. He'll still take some official visits this fall, which includes the Iron Bowl in Auburn. Laguins is considered a four-star linebacker and one of the main reasons Oconee County has been able to have some recent success. He plays multiple positions on defense with the defense featured around him. The Warriors haven't been completely void of talent over the past two decades.
Expedia and AMR make nice -- for now. The months long feud between Expedia (Nasdaq: EXPE) and American Airlines parent AMR (NYSE: AMR) is over. The two parties are ready to begin working together again, agreeing to let Expedia visitors book flights on American and American Eagle. Portals and legacy carriers haven't been playing nice since December, when AMR broke free from Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE: OWW) over pricing and rate publishing methods. Expedia's Hotwire and its namesake portal joined Orbitz in offering American-free deals.

Said he would join efforts to repeal the health care law, including supporting a constitutional amendment that "prohibits the federal government from imposing President Obama's individual mandate, to protect Floridians' freedom to control their health care choices."
Ikea doesn’t just want to sell you furniture–it also wants to sell you on sustainable living. And how best to live sustainably than to grow your own food? That’s the idea behind a new line of products the Swedish company is developing with British industrial designer Tom Dixon. Due to be announced in May 2019 and released in Ikea stores in 2021, the products will be focused on making it easier for people to farm in an urban environment. Ikea has already introduced a small hydroponic system designed to let you grow lettuce on your kitchen countertop.
All this, combined with talk about a possible summit, seems to hold out promise for a better US-Soviet climate. But it is too soon to know what it means in practical terms. There is no doubt Mr. Andropov has immense problems, especially economic ones, and would welcome a decrease in tensions with the United States so that he can get on with solving them. It should also be said that he is shrewdly playing on growing public fears in the West about the nuclear buildup and is seeking to project the image of a peacemaker.

Jesse Bhattal, the former head of Lehman Brothers in Asia, is joining Lazard as a senior adviser, the New York bank said in a release Tuesday. Bhattal helped broker Nomura’s purchase Lehman’s Asian and Europen operations.

But a little more than three years after the deal closed, he left Nomura.
Marc Riley delves into the diverse, rich and rewarding BBC spoken work archive to unearth two interviews linked by fierce rivalry - Frank Zappa from 1984 and Lou Reed from 1992. The BBC's archive is justifiably and inarguably world-famous, but most of this attention and praise is showered on the riches contained within the Beeb's music archive - the life-changing Peel performances, seminal sessions from Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie. But these musical marvels risk over-shadowing another archive that's just as diverse, rich and rewarding - the BBC's spoken word, music archive.

TEHRAN -- Masud Kimiaii regards his film “Crime”, featuring a goon hired to kill someone, the closest movie to his world. The film is an entry in the national section of the 29th Fajr Film Festival. “This movie has a particular attitude towards man, family and life. It features a man who comes out of his shell and turns out to be a man of the world of today,” said Kimiaii. “Crime” was shown to cineastes and critics and reporters on Monday followed by a question and answer panel which included cast and crew members.
“Tell me something unique or quirky about you. Something nobody knows.” Candace Klein, the founder of Bad Girl Ventures and SoMoLend, an online lending platform, was still in high energy last night after presenting her live pitch strategies to several hundred entrepreneurs in Salt Lake. The small dinner group was the denouement of an intense evening. She’d flown in earlier in the day to give her presentation at the University of Utah for Grow America and the local Entrepreneur Circle Meetup. Response was so overwhelming, Grow America EVP Richard Swart had moved the event to a bigger facility.
What is responsible for the slow pace of insurance growth in the country? Lack of insurance awareness; low capital of the Nigerian populace and the level of income have really affected insurance. In our country of over 170 million people, we cannot boast of even more than one million Nigerians taking insurance as of today. So a lot needs to be done by the industry, the regulators and the individual companies, to create awareness and ensure that we get to the grassroots and bring in products that are readily available in the market.
PRINCE WILLIAM and Prince Harry share a “greater closeness” than many reports may suggest, after the brothers have been at the centre of rumours of a rift between their royal households, a royal commentator claims. Prince William and Kate Middleton, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, are still at the centre of rumours that have been swirling for the past few months about a rift between the two brothers’ royal households. While many have turned to the Duchesses of Cambridge and Sussex as the focus of the potential strain in the relationship, other commentators have posited that the two royal brothers may have had a falling out themselves.
COLUMBUS, OHIO, March 10, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Responding to a report released Monday by abortion advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America, Heartbeat International President Peggy Hartshorn, Ph.D., pointed to what she calls the fundamental difference between "true" and "false" reproductive health. NARAL's report, "Crisis Pregnancy Centers Lie: The Insidious Threat To Reproductive Freedom," represents several years of opposition to the 2,500 pregnancy help organizations operating independently in the United States, most of whom are fully funded by local and private donors. In its 24 pages, NARAL's report features 107 citations.
The BBC has agreed to fully fund free TV licences for over-75s from 2020/21, the Culture Secretary has said. It is part of a deal which would see the BBC also benefit from a reduction in the amount of licence fee income used to pay for broadband roll-out, from £150m to nothing in 2020/2021. There will also be a return to inflation-based licence fee increases and a change in the law to ensure the licence fee covers those who only access catch-up TV. Last week the BBC said it expected licence fee income to drop by £150m in 2016/2017 and announced that it was cutting 1,000 jobs to save £50m a year.
Young coaches, passionate about the sport, enter into coaching and, soon thereafter, are driven out by parents who won't leave them alone. There's a coaching shortage right now in Massachusetts. Visit the MIAA's Web site, and you'll find pages and pages of openings, many of them for fall sports that kick off in a matter of four weeks. Of course, there are plenty of reasons why. But No. 1 stands alone, ascending far above reasons involving bank accounts, time and master's degrees.
THROUGH a pall of extreme violence, a glimmer of hope has appeared. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani opened a peace conference in Kabul on Wednesday by offering the Afghan Taliban peace talks with no preconditions. In a sweeping proposal, a first in over 17 years of war against the Taliban, the Afghan leader suggested a ceasefire, prisoner swaps and recognising the Taliban as a political party to facilitate a Kabul-based peace process. The offer of dialogue itself is not new and many elements of Mr Ghani’s proposal are familiar, but taken together they offer a potentially comprehensive path to eventual peace and stability in Afghanistan.
A 58-year-old Glendale man was arrested early Monday after he allegedly threatened his neighbor with a large kitchen knife upon being told he was being evicted, police said. Artie Mendoza was taken into custody about 1:50 a.m. in the 1200 block of Mariposa Street, according to Glendale police. A witness told officers that Mendoza allegedly challenged his neighbor to a fight as he swung the knife in his left hand and proclaimed that he was a killer, police said. At one point, Mendoza’s knife punctured a wall near where the neighbor was standing, police said.
A plain cork bulletin board turns into a piece of functional decor when paint transforms it from drab to display-worthy. Paint it a solid color to create a bold background for notes and photos, or give the piece a custom look by adding a monogram or graphic silhouette. Use a prefab bulletin board or go homemade by gluing a sheet of cork over stiff cardboard or a sheet of shipping foam, sized to fit inside a frame. Take the corkboard out of the frame or mask a permanently affixed frame with painter's tape. Use a craft knife to push the tape down flush along the inside edges of the frame.
Fujitsu Siemens may not be the first company you think of as manufacturing notebooks but in the last two years the company has improved its range to such an extent that it is now one of the top five suppliers in Europe. The secret behind this success has been the Amilo line of notebooks, which combine great design with an equally impressive low cost. At £899 (inc. VAT) the Fujitsu Siemens Amilo Pro V2010 represents genuine value for money. Weighing at 2.9kg, this latest version of the Amilo Pro is lighter than its predecessor but still manages to come supplied with a 15-inch TFT screen.
LOS ANGELES — He manages one of the most popular sports franchises on the planet, the team that is the reigning World Series champion, that last fall ended 108 years of historic frustration. So, naturally, Joe Maddon opened his pregame media session Friday by answering multiple questions about … dying his hair? Yes, and with a substance that, based on the photos, appeared to be similar to shoe polish. “Maaco,” Maddon corrected, a reference to the auto body repair specialists and the fact his hair was less dyed and more lacquered.
Dr. Suk-Ki Hong was born in Kyonggi Do, South Korea in 1928. He received his medical degree from Severance Union Medical College (now Yonsei University College of Medicine) in 1948 and his doctorate in physiology from the University of Rochester in 1956 under the guidance of Dr. Edward Adolph. Dr. Hong moved to the University of Buffalo in 1956 to join Dr. Hermann Rahn’s department and returned to Yonsei University in 1959. From 1959 to 1968, he rose from Assistant Professor to Professor and Chair of the Physiology Department at Yonsei. In 1968 he accepted a professorship at the University of Hawaii’s Department of Physiology.
The Silver Springs Senior Center has designated Saturday as March for Meals Day in Silver Springs. The goal is to ensure no senior in the community goes to bed hungry, at least for one day. “March for Meals really is a community event,” said Bobbie Hughes, site manager of Silver Springs Senior Center. From 1-4 p.m. Saturday, members of the community are asked to donate the money they would spend for their own lunch, or, call the program and sign up to work as a volunteer. The senior center currently serves 85 meals each day.
I seem to have a more difficult time each year getting into the spirit of Christmas. I am not sure if that is because the youngest of my four children is now sixteen, or the ever present commercialism that puts me off in such a way, that I attempt to have no part in it. My eldest and I joke that it should be called 'Giftmas'. I feel almost justified about going easy on the holiday season now as I feel I gave my children idyllic childhood Christmas'. Something I grew up with.
Former Coronation Street star Helen Flanagan is recovering after a break-in at her home which left her "very shaken" but unharmed. The actress, who also appeared in I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! last year, had raiders at her home in Cheshire late last night. Police are now investigating after jewellery and a phone were taken from the property she shares with footballer Scott Sinclair. A spokesman for the 22-year-old TV star said: "We confirm the home Helen shares with Scott was burgled last night. "Helen is naturally very shaken but is unharmed.
What Car Would You Never Want Even As A Gift? Amazingly (or more correctly, obviously) the old Chrysler Sebring made our list of most scathing car reviews twice: once as a Sebring, again after it was mildly refreshed as the 200C. That says something. Cars are nice and all because they are generally better at crossing long distances on land than walking, but the downside is that only a relative few among the boring masses are worth driving. You don’t want all the stuff that’s out there, even as a Christmas/Hanukkah/Toyotathon gift.
In Daniel Dencik's agreeably meditative, beautifully shot documentary "Expedition to the End of the World," a three-masted schooner carries a cadre of scientists and artists to a mostly ice-encrusted region of northeast Greenland that, because of global warming, is now passable for a few weeks each year. The mostly uncharted area and its exploratory bounty provoke this eccentric, witty and chummy group — experts in archaeology, marine biology, geology and the visual arts — to philosophize on evolution and humankind's impact. They fish, take samples, wander, draw, record and speculate on what that polar bear in the distance is up to.
One of the country's biggest horse race, the Castle Tankard is back on the cards following a US$85 000 sponsorship. After a 3-year absence, Zimbabwe's pinnacle event on the horse racing calendar the Castle tankard is back. An excited horse racing fraternity on Friday morning converged at the Borrowdale Race Course to witness the launch of the 49th edition of the Castle Tankard with Delta Beverages Marketing Manager, Maxwell Karombo, expressing pleasure in unveiling the prestigious horse racing event. Mashonaland Turf Club Chairman, Mike Van Blek thanked Delta for returning to the horseracing scene.
Yaya Toure is happy to be linked with the likes of Arsenal and Manchester City but insists his focus is currently only on trying to do well on the pitch for Barcelona. The Barclays Premier League rivals are both reportedly following the Ivory Coast international as they look to bolster their respective squads during the January transfer window. But while Toure admits he is pleased to see his name associated with clubs like those, the 25-year-old refused to speculate on whether he would be willing to trade Barcelona for a move to England if the chance arose this month, preferring instead to leave off-field matters in the hands of his agent.
It was a weird weekend, but that�s why I�m thankful for it. PANAMA CITY BEACH � It was a weird weekend, but that�s why I�m thankful for it. Just before that, I had participated in a photo shoot involving smoke, flames and a face-full of flour tossed with glee from off-camera by people I thought I could trust. In the background, a child ran around wearing a Buzz Lightyear costume. All in all, a pretty fun way to spend an evening. But it set me to thinking, as I am prone to attempt, about the connections.
REDMOND, OR -- A local nonprofit wants to erect a statue of Bob Eberhard in downtown Redmond, to honor the long-time resident, entrepreneur and dairy owner who passed away last fall. Teri Jansen, with the 2018 class of Leadership Redmond, says it would be done by the same artist who created a statue in memory of Eberhard’s late wife, last year. "The Kaye Eberhard Memorial was a child reading a book, sitting on a stack of books. Our statue is actually going to be a life-sized bronze of Bob Eberhard."
"Some people think that the people who voted for Trump are racists and sexists and homophobes and deplorable folks. I don't agree, because I've been there. Let me tell you something else some of you might not agree with, it wasn't that Donald Trump won the election, it was that the Democratic Party lost the election." This touched off a wild ovation in the hall, although several of the minority guests behind Sanders on stage looked at him very much as though he'd grown a second head.
Thirty retired generals are urging President Obama to declassify the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on CIA torture, arguing that without accountability and transparency the practice could be resumed. "After taking office, you showed decisive leadership by issuing an executive order banning torture and other forms of abusive interrogation," the retirees say in an open letter released Thursday. But with former government officials claiming that so-called "enhanced interrogation" techniques were effective, a future president could rescind the ban unless facts in the committee report are known, the generals wrote. The White House did not respond for a request for comment.
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) - Marshall has a shot at another 10-victory season and Connecticut can finish with a winning record for the first time in five years. So don’t try to convince the Thundering Herd (9-3) and Huskies (6-6) the stakes aren’t high in Saturday’s St. Petersburg Bowl. Both teams have enjoyed a week of fun in the Florida sun, while also focussing on what they want to accomplish on game day. Marshall fell short of a goal of repeating as Conference USA champions, but finishing with double-digit victories again is important to coach Doc Holliday and his players.
A record $328 million strategy will be funded by the Morrison government to combat domestic violence. SCHOOL kids will be taught how not to become perpetrators or victims of domestic violence and family courts will tip off agencies to help women at risk, under a multimillion-dollar attack on the scourge. The Morrison Government will today unveil the biggest yet financial contribution to beat domestic violence - a $328 million package that focuses on prevention, identification, rescue and recovery. With eight women hospitalised every day due to domestic violence, Scott Morrison will today declare enough is enough and help give women the courage and resources to leave their dangerous lives.
New York University professor Adam Alter, author of "Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked," explains how checking your work email can change your level of productivity. Following is a transcript of the video. How long do you think it takes before you check the average email that comes in when you're at work? Most people when asked that question say a number like maybe five minutes, maybe 10 minutes. The answer based on data is six seconds. So, on average, we check our emails six seconds after they arrive, which is a staggering number.
Goshen Memorial on Highway 9 in Cherokee County. Editor's note: Due to the threat of severe weather on Sunday, April 14, Goshen United Methodist Church in Piedmont has cancelled its memorial service and all Sunday services. Rev. Nedra Deerman, pastor at Goshen, said the commemoration will be rescheduled for another date. “We’re encouraging people to draw away with their families and worship in whatever way they can,” she said. It has been 25 years since a tornado forever altered the congregation at Goshen United Methodist Church in Piedmont.
The Six Continents Hotels Inc. and Inter-Continental Hotels Corp. chains have pulled up their welcome mats and are hauling an unwanted visitor into court, charging that online marketing company The Gator Corp. is illegally adding its pop-up ads to the hotel’s Web sites and confusing customers. In a 51-page lawsuit filed Nov. 12 in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Georgia, the hotel chains allege that Redwood City, Calif.-based Gator is causing its pop-up advertisements to appear when hotel customers try to use the Web sites to make reservations and get information.

DANIEL STURRIDGE starts for Liverpool against Chelsea tonight. Jurgen Klopp has restored a number of his first team stars to his starting XI, making eight changes to the side which beat Watford on Sunday. Simon Mignolet, Alberto Moreno and Philippe Coutinho are the only players to retain their place. Roberto Firmino and Adam Lallana are recalled along with Sturridge in an attacking front four alongside Coutinho. Nathaniel Clyne, Kolo Toure and Dejan Lovren return in defence while Emre Can and James Milner also return to the starting XI. Liverpool will climb up to seventh with a win.
Probiotic drinks and supplements are likely to have no health benefits, according to a study. Six in 10 British households buy probiotics regularly. Their use has grown significantly in recent years, led by brands such as Yakult and Actimel. The products claim to introduce “good” bacteria to the gut to help with a range of conditions. But scientists at University College London put eight probiotic products through three tests and found only one passed all of them. They investigated whether products contained as many live bacteria as claimed on their labels, whether the bacteria survived in the stomach and whether they then flourished in the gut.
Originally published under the title "Do we worship the same God? Wheaton College, Larycia Hawkins and Miroslav Volf." The recent suspension of Larycia Hawkins by Wheaton College is a symptom of a fault line among evangelicals about Islam. The question of whether the God of the Qur'an is the same as the God of the Bible is an important and complex one, but it is unhelpful to politicize inquiry into it by insisting that anyone who disagrees with one position or another is a bigot. Those who claim that Muslims and Christians do not worship the same God base this upon Muslims' denial of the Trinity and the incarnation.
Authorities say a tractor-trailer hauling 30,000 pounds of live Canadian lobster has overturned on an interstate in Maine. Maine state troopers say truck driver Horst Puff, of Greenfield, Nova Scotia, reported that he swerved early Wednesday to avoid striking a car that had spun out in front of him on Interstate 95 in Benton. Puff&apos;s truck ended up on its side in the median, but he wasn&apos;t hurt. State police spokesman Steve McCausland says the fate of the lobsters is not immediately clear. A crane was dispatched to hoist the truck upright so the cargo could be inspected.
The much hyped Aishwarya Rai Hollywood venture Pink Panther 2 has failed to please the critics who attended the film's trials. The much hyped Aishwarya Rai Hollywood venture Pink Panther 2 has failed to please the critics who attended the film's trials. Even though the film formally releases on February 6, this initial response sends across bad signals for the film. Some excerpts from the film's reviews. Pink Panther 2 is a total waste of time. You can pretty much guess what happens: Clouseau says inappropriate things, Clouseau breaks stuff, Clouseau winds up being smarter than anyone else in the movie.

Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. When to head out to get the best Halloween candy is always a big decision. The FBI will examine newly discovered Hillary Clinton emails, which surfaced as part of an investigation of Anthony Weiner. An AFL-CIO poll reveals union support for Donald Trump is waning. The president may be Democratic nominee’s best campaign surrogate, but they differ on some key areas of policy.
Rep. Joe Barton had it wrong. Last week, oil company executives testified to Congress about energy policy in the wake of BP’s ongoing disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. A casual observer may have thought we were transported to an alternate universe. At one session, Representative Joe Barton of Texas apologized to BP for what he called a White House “shakedown” (because President Obama demanded a $20 billion escrow account from BP to ensure that damage claims will be paid). Mr. Barton didn’t just get his politics wrong, he got the petroleum-powered math all fouled up too.
SWANSEA — Two major school projects started moving forward after classes closed out at the high school and Brown Elementary School and there was some good news on another pending project. Superintendent of Schools John Robidoux noted that progress is being made for the approximately $1.4 million replacement of windows at the Brown School. There is an approximately 54 percent reimbursement from the state for the windows. JJ Cardosi is the general contractor and Supt. Robidoux noted that the work has been very good to this point. "They are on track and on time for a completion before school opens," Supt.

Will rising food costs after Brexit really cause thousands of deaths? There could be between 3000 and 23,000 extra deaths in the UK by 2030 because the cost of fruit and vegetables will rise so much after Brexit, warns a study that modelled the impact of various Brexit scenarios. The claim comes amid growing alarm about the prospect of the UK leaving the European Union with no transitional deal for negotiating a permanent arrangement, leading to shortages of food and drugs as lorries queue for days. Leading supermarkets warned this week that a no-deal Brexit could leave shelves empty because they can’t stockpile fresh food.
For 30 years, people from all over the world have traveled to Manhattan, Kansas to train with and tour the International Grains Program (IGP). Since its beginning, IGP has continued to increase its capacity to educate and train international buyers of Kansas commodities.

THE SLOVAK PARLIAMENT passed a legislative amendment on eGovernment on September 23. The bill was submitted by the Finance Ministry andleads to significant changes in three areas. The first change to be introduced by the so-called electronic government bill concerns the conditions and methods of identification and authentication of individuals via computer. The draft bill has been aimed at making the legal norm more precise and to supplement it so that the rules of identification and authentication are applied exclusively to public administration, and thus prevent any contradictions in interpreting it, for example for use in internal communication between public administrative bodies, the ministry explained, as quoted by the TASR newswire.
The River Tone at Taunton flows brown beside shopfronts, cafes and the Brewhouse theatre, sliding smoothly under footbridges, easing by car parks, offices and flats, slipping beneath the roaring M5 before twisting across the Somerset Levels to Burrowbridge. Here it joins the River Parrett and surges to Bridgwater and the sea. Out in Bridgwater Bay, wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) can smell the mud washed down by heavy autumn rain. They wait in the lower reaches of the river until the water level rises enough to allow them to migrate upriver to spawn, seeking the same patch of gravel where they hatched years before.
Shane Smith began his speech three sheets to the wind, lying prone on stage, surrounded by dozens of breathless hipsters with the same haircut and beard, smartphones illuminating the darkness. “I’m the Russian bear that s---- on the floor for nickels,” the CEO of Vice Media grumbled once he was vertical again, admitting he’d had “a few ales.” There was a recitation of lyrics from Sham 69’s “If the Kids Are United” that turned into scream-singing backed by a full band. Of course this would happen at a Vice presentation to its advertisers.

Summer is peeping around the corner and the days are now at their longest, Wimbledon will be coming up soon along with strawberries and cream ... so my recipe for a simple, Strawberries and Cream ice cream you can make at home with no special equipment seems timely. The temperature in my kitchen is rising on a daily basis but we have the lovely long evenings to cool off and relax, a splash along the beach on the way home or just sitting outside with a BBQ ticking over as the sun goes down. Dorset's a pretty good place to live all things considered.
The Federal Reserve says the economy was expanding at a "slight-to-moderate pace" in March and early April, with some regions seeing signs of strengthening after a winter slowdown. The stock market has been so hot this year that it might need an ice-cold Fruitopia, or a Zima. With global growth slowing and many countries struggling with high debts, now is not the time for the "self-inflicted" economic wound of trade wars, the head of the International Monetary Fund is warning. White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett says Herman Cain has ample experience at the Federal Reserve level.
In the 2010 World Cup, players complained the ball was wonky, so this year has an all-new ball. NASA used smoke, lasers, and fluid boxes to test out its aerodynamics. Aside from producing some awesome photographs, the actual science is pretty cool, too. Scale model of a standard soccer ball in a water channel. Green dye marks flow lines; pink dye is injected behind the ball to highlight the low-pressure zone in the lee of the ball. A normal ball has 32 panels, but why would the World Cup use an off-the-shelf stock ball?
The National Disciplinary Committee (NDC) of the African National Congress on Thursday confirmed its previous decision that Marius Fransman was guilty of misconduct and should be suspended from the party for five years. Acting disciplinary committee chair Susan Shabangu said that by not attending an NDC hearing scheduled for Thursday‚ Fransman had denied himself a second opportunity to present his case and prove his innocence. Fransman has widely protested his innocence since becoming embroiled in a scandal after he was accused of allegedly sexually assaulting a young woman who accompanied him to an ANC birthday celebration in January 2016.
The news media is in a state of flux, analysis of the US market has shown. And, while traditional newspapers continue to see advertising revenue decline, old school media firms are struggling to carve an online niche for themselves and rely on third parties to fill their online pages with ads. According to a report by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism, the financial performance of US news media improved in 2010, in comparison to a "dismal" 2009, but newspapers saw a continued in advertising revenue - down by 6.4 per cent.
(CNS) Updated: An air and sea search currently underway for a missing diver has so far proved unsuccessful and police from the Marine Unit said divers and local vessels will be welcome to assist when the search resumes Monday morning at 7am. The RCIPS Marine Unit, its air support as well as uniform officers and a number of local dive vessels began searching for the diver, who is visiting from the USA, following a report on Sunday morning that he had gone missing off Seven Mile Beach in the heart of Cayman’s tourist district.
Citadel Securities has quietly become one of the largest forces in U.S. stock trading. From the 35th floor of a downtown Chicago office tower, Citadel executes one out of every eight stock trades in the United States. At roughly 900 million shares a day, more stocks move through Citadel's systems than the New York Stock Exchange, which trades roughly 700 million shares a day. If you own a 401(k) or have ever used an online broker, your trades have almost certainly passed through Citadel. The most notable thing about the firm's trading floor is how eerily quiet it can be.
In 1999 Monika Mitchell wrote, produced and directed a short film that she took to festivals. At the time, she recalled Sunday at a Television Critics Assn. press tour panel, when her name came up in the credits there were so few women helming projects that she overheard an executive say, “Monika’s a funny name for a guy.” In the two decades since that experience, she has crossed mediums between film and television, working most recently on Lifetime’s original movie “Jane Green’s To Have and to Hold,” while the industry around her has made slower advances.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday night revealed that he plans to meet North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un for a two-day summit in Vietnam on Feb. 27 and 28, as he also boasted about averting a deadly standoff with the rogue nation. "If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed," Trump said during his State of the Union address. "Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.
VIENNA – A senior U.N. official announced progress Friday in long-stalled efforts to resume a probe of suspicions that Iran may have worked to develop nuclear arms, saying the investigation could be restarted by early next year. He acknowledged that a key IAEA request -- a visit to a site linked to suspected nuclear activity --was again denied. But he told reporters at Vienna airport that he expected IAEA experts to be allowed to go to Parchin and follow up on suspicions it might have been used as part of secret arms-related experiments once the probe is resumed.
Famous astrophysicist and host of StarTalk Radio Neil deGrasse Tyson was surprisingly sassy in his review of the sci-fi epic "The Martian." "The Martian" follows the story of astronaut Mark Watney who must rely on science to survive after he gets stranded on Mars. NASA then pulls out all the stops to get him back to Earth alive. Most scientists have praised "The Martian" for its attempt at scientific accuracy and realism. In "The Martian," NASA has a lot of autonomy and scientists are calling all of the shots. This is not always the case in the real world.
AFTER a couple of bumpy years, it looks like Tunarama Festival is back on track. The Tunarama Ambassador Quest in particular has needed a bit of a make-over, or perhaps it was the community that needed to be reminded of its importance – either way it is great to see a really healthy number of entrants participating for 2019. In 2017 the quest was down to just one entrant by the time the festival rolled around so to have seven entrants ready to take on the task and vie for the ambassador title must mean the committee is doing something right.
As Airbnb adds more features to court business users, a smaller startup has raised some funding to challenge it in the $18 billion business travel market. 2nd Address, an Airbnb-style platform for business travellers looking for home rentals that extend beyond 30 days — as an alternative to staying in hotels — is announcing funding of $10 million from GV (formerly Google Ventures) and Foundation Capital, along with Amicus and Pierre Lamond. The startup says it will be investing the money to improve its technology as well as expand to more cities.
Wilton Speight pirouetted into the air as the whistle blew to end the play before it could begin. It was a snapshot of disgust over mistakes that have towered over UCLA like a 100-foot shadow all season. The Bruins fought through the penalties and the dropped passes and the missed tackles Saturday against Arizona State, a big defensive stop producing one last chance with 93 seconds left. UCLA trailed by three points and needed only to drive into field-goal range behind the play of a quarterback who finally resembled the player the Bruins hoped they were getting as a graduate transfer. Speight never got the chance.
A new study on news consumption via tablet computers suggests catching up on the news is one of the most popular activities on the devices, rating even higher than social networking and gaming. But the research, conducted by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism with The Economist Group, found that most users still aren’t willing to pay for news on tablets. A year and a half after the iPad’s introduction, the study overall said 11% of U.S. adults now own a tablet of some kind.
Very few phone leaks are accidents, and a spate of teasers of HTC’s next flagship suggest a launch next month. The HTC M10 reportedly has a 5.1 inch QHD display and a revised camera. Its looks borrow from the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy families, with a front mounted fingerprint sensor, with availability from May. The troubled Taiwanese OEM kept the flagship under wraps at Mobile World Congress last month, while Samsung and LG stole the headlines. 2014’s flagship, the HTC One M8 was popular with reviewers and sold well.
The cabinet approval was granted to the proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena as the Mahaweli Development and Environment Minister to promote the exportation of Gyrinopswalla (Wallapatta) plant and cultivate the plant based on its commercial value, Cabinet spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today. Minister Senarathne said an official would be appointed to issue a permit to allow the possession and transportation of the plant. He said President Maithripala Sirisena as the Mahaweli Development and Environment Minister had submitted a cabinet paper in this regard following the methods prepared with the agreement of the officials of Forest Conservation Department and Wildlife Conservation and Biodiversity Secretariat.
As former senators representing Montana and New Hampshire, both of which border Canada, we experienced firsthand the value in a close relationship with America’s northern neighbor as a friend, strategic ally and trading partner. While the U.S. and Canada have had policy disagreements about nuanced issues, our strong relationship means that, generally, we work them out. This includes one of today’s most talked about topics: free trade. To work appropriately, free trade must also be fair trade. Otherwise, one side of the trading partnership loses drastically.
Tight end Allen Reisner, 25, played in five games for Jacksonville last season and finished with five catches for 40 yards. He was also with the Vikings during the 2011 and 2012 seasons. EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. — In the second week of their offseason program, the Minnesota Vikings added two players to their roster on Tuesday. Minnesota announced it has signed tight end Allen Reisner, who was with the team in 2011 and 2012 as an undrafted free agent out of Iowa before playing parts of the past two seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars.
And so Chittister did. Over the next four days, she shared with Roberts the story of an early life shaped by domestic violence and vulnerability. Chittister’s father, Daniel Daugherty, died when she was a toddler. Joan’s widowed mother, Loretta, soon married Harold “Dutch” Chittister, an alcoholic with a fierce temper who subjected her to physical abuse and consigned Joan to a childhood full of fear. It was only in 2011, at age seventy-five, that Joan was ready to tell this part of her life story. “It’s time,” she told Roberts.
Jenna Lyons, J. Crew President and Creative Director. The fashion industry is filled with designers, celebrities, journalists, stylists, and executives vying for influence. We've selected the best of the best and created a list of who determines what's cool in America. Some of the people who made the list are controversial public figures who move fashion trends based on what they wear. Others are executives who run multi-billion dollar companies. Everyone on the list is a magnate in their own right. Influence: Ahrendts solidified Burberry's position as one of the most aspirational brands in the world.
As the case against two people allegedly involved in an attempt to extort money from the Travolta family in the wake of 16-year-old Jett’s death continues, father John Travolta has been officially named as a witness in the proceedings, E! News reports. Documents filed Monday at Magistrate’s Court in New Providence names a total of 14 witnesses, including John, as well as his Bahamian lawyer, Allyson Maynard and his U.S.-based lawyers, Michael Ossi and Michael McDermott. Yesterday ambulance driver Tarino Lightbourne pleaded not guilty to attempted extortion and conspiracy to extort.
WASHINGTON — If North Korea fires a missile at Hawaii on or around the July Fourth holiday, as Japanese reports have warned, the U.S. plans a measured response in coordination with Russia, China, Japan and South Korea. Jones said the U.S. has “looked at a range of options that we have at our disposal” and is maintaining “an open and constant dialogue” with Russia, China, Japan and South Korea, all of whom share regional interests. North Korea on Thursday reportedly test-fired four short-range missiles that flew about 60 miles before falling into the sea.
When Bigfoot sightings come to mind, you probably think about the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest. But there have been 323 strange encounters reported since the 1980s far from Northern California, Oregon and Washington state. That would be the Sunshine State of Florida. In fact, those sightings have become a kind of cottage industry, especially in Northwest Florida, home of the Gulf Coast Bigfoot Research Organization, founded by Mick Minnis, appropriately the owner of the Bigfoot Moving Company. Some of the reports the group has investigated are indeed harrowing.
Why is there so much interest in the youth demographic? Put simply, the Middle East's youth population bulge makes it too big to ignore. "In 2015, close to one person out of five in the region was aged between 15 and 24 years," the World Economic Forum recently noted, following on an earlier observation that "one-third of the population is below the age of 15 years". The forum goes on to suggest that one of the main challenges will be the empowerment of youth and the huge pool of talent, energy, and resources it represents.
Keep an eye on the camera shake warning. 1 Keep an eye on the camera shake warning. Don't try to handhold the camera at shutter speeds slower than 1/focal length of the camera (35-mm equivalent) unless the camera is using some sort of image stabilization. 2 To shoot at faster shutter speeds, bump up the ISO equivalent to let in more light, though you'll pay for this with a noisier image. 3 When possible, take an extra second to check your stance before shooting. Bring your elbows in close to your body and exhale slowly while shooting.
Director Brady Corbet‘s Vox Lux is like the warped, nasty sibling of A Star Is Born. The film starts, quite literally, with a bang, when teenager Celeste (Raffey Cassidy) is the sole survivor of a school shooting. Footage of Celeste singing at a memorial service sweeps the nation, blasting the young girl into the pop-star stratosphere thanks to Jude Law‘s savvy talent manager. Flash-forward a decade or two and Celeste—now played by Natalie Portman, going all out for this role—is a Gaga-esque superstar, but the years in-between have sharpened her naive edges into something much more tragic.
Voters in Massachusetts this November will likely decide whether the commonwealth should join a handful of other states in legalizing marijuana. Four years after Bay State voters approved a medicinal marijuana program, a group called the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol has proposed a ballot question asking voters to legalize recreational use and sales of pot. But what exactly are you signing up for if you vote yes? The full initiative text is almost 8,500 words. So we broke it down for you. If the question passes, here’s what the legal marijuana landscape will look like in Massachusetts.
Head-on collision between passenger and goods trains kills at least eight people in eastern part of country. At least eight people have died after a passenger train collided with a goods train in eastern Germany, police and firemen said. Up to 20 other people were seriously injured in the accident, which occurred at Hordorf, near Oschersleben, in Saxony-Anhalt, late on Saturday. Firemen said that a further 20 people had suffered minor injuries, while a police spokesman said that a total of 40 people were evacuated to hospitals. The passenger train derailed and landed on its side after the head-on collision, but did not catch fire.
What about the chemical time bombs in our midst? Chemical weapons are made by many nations in the world, including our own. Who has them, who gets them and how they are used is a kind of war roulette. Another kind of bio-terrorism game is local and national, and I don't see the president lobbying the Monsanto shills in Congress to stop the use of chemical pesticides akin to 2-4D, a warfare defoliant (Agent Orange) used for some genetically modified organisms. GMO's are time bombs in our bodies and genetic land mines in our soil.
AmpLit Fest, a day-long literary festival, returned to Riverside Park’s Pier I for a second year on Saturday, June 10. Hosted by a partnership of the park’s annual Summer on the Hudson series and Lamprophonic, an Upper West Side writers group, the free festival featured an afternoon of writing workshops, panel discussions with local authors and readings. Moosiki Kids, a music program for children led by Laura Nupponen, opened the event, and families who arrived at noon filed into seats, strollers packing the audience.
Recently, nationalism and populism have been expanding around the world, becoming a global phenomenon. In the U.S. presidential election, populism and nationalism are rampant. Listening to Trump’s speech, it sounds like all of America’s problems are caused by China. Nationalism has two connotations. First, love for your own country, which is not wrong. Second, exclusion of others and pushing the blame for your country’s problems onto other countries. I am good, others are bad. This is problematic. In electoral politics, some people like to use nationalism and populism to curry favor with the public.
Stanford is 1-2 all-time against Pitt, with the lone victory coming in the 1928 Rose Bowl Game. Pitt won the first meeting 16-7 in 1922 and the most recent meeting 7-0 in 1932. The Redbox Bowl, played in Levi’s Stadium, passed on Stanford to take an Oregon (8-4, 5-4 Pac-12) team with an inferior conference record and a home loss to the Cardinal. Executive director Ryan Oppelt indicated that because the Cardinal had played in the stadium three of the last four years, the Redbox Bowl was inclined to invite Oregon, which has never participated in the bowl.
On reflection, I still stick with my initial reaction to the Shanghai Town Meeting appearance, rather than being won over by the on-scene complaints of my Shanghai friend Adam Minter as described here. If you combine Obama's opening statement (White House version here), with his answers to the questions about the Great Firewall, it seems to me that he said just about as much on censorship and liberties as a visiting dignitary could say, in the circumstances. "And that is why America will always speak out for these core principles around the world.
Why are Brits turning to the pub as a place to work? Pubs, faced with rising taxes on alcohol and worldwide smoking bans, have had to quickly rally to find alternative means of attracting customers. Whether it is by offering food, "family friendly" atmospheres, coffee or Wi-Fi, the pub is not simply a place you hang out in the evening -- and may indeed be replacing the traditional 9-5 office. According to a survey of 2,000 adults by Wi-Fi provider The Cloud, people are increasingly turning to the pub as a secondary workstation -- thanks to free Wi-Fi often on offer.
Now that the NFL lockout is over, the Jaguars will start a season-ticket blitz Tuesday with the theme of "It's Go Time," hoping to make up for lost time. The Jaguars need to sell about total of 17,000 non-premium tickets per game - including 10,000 season tickets - to avoid TV blackouts for the second consecutive season. "It's a big number, but I'm cautiously optimistic," said Macky Weaver, the senior vice president of sales and marketing. Added team owner Wayne Weaver: "We need the fans to step up."
Air pollution is an environmental problem. There is no doubt that the rapid increase in the population and development in the urban, industrial and social sectors have led to an increase in pollution rates, especially air pollution, due to the large the number of vehicles and the expansion of construction in industrial facilities. Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research has carried out many studies and research projects to monitor and evaluate air pollution in factories, hospitals and oilfields that are associated with urban growth, which increase pressure on available resources such as electricity and water and exacerbate sand and dust storms.
Scheana Marie and Robert Parks-Valletta have been facing allegations of an impending split but earlier this week on Instagram, the Vanderpump Rules star shared a post in which she mentioned her actor boyfriend. As Robert Parks-Valletta enjoyed a vacation in Italy, Scheana Marie, traveled to Las Vegas with her sister and during their trip, Scheana Marie posted a photo of the two of them and let her boyfriend know that she was missing him and ready for him to come home. “Now, @robsvalletta get back from Italy. I miss you,” she wrote.
“The weakest part of the case is the alleged victim’s statement to police,” the source said. The source claims that police are struggling to believe she was taken to three separate rooms and never attempted to alert the “20 or so” people in the living room at the time. According to the accuser, she was barricaded in a smaller room, away from the other residents in the hotel suite. K.M. told police that she was so traumatized by the incident that it took her two days to go to the police.

Google today confirmed that Cloud Print would be built into the latest version of the Chrome browser. The feature was first revealed in the spring, and it's aimed at substantially improving the simplicity of printing. Cloud Print works by hosting printer drivers on your Google Account in the cloud. By keeping printer drivers decentralized with Cloud Print, users can avoid the hassle of repeatedly setting up a printer. Documents are then sent to Google, where they're interpreted and directed back to your printer to be converted to hard copy. The feature bears some similarities to Apple's much touted AirPrint feature.

How does where you live affect your life expectancy? The fruits of so-called “free enterprise” have long been debated in economics. The goal has been “wealth” or “human welfare” at least since Adam Smith published “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” in 1776. But what exactly is human welfare? And how do we measure wealth? The obvious way: money. Simply measure how much money a society or individual earns or possesses, because money is so damn simple to count. But various economists have rejected simple as simplistic.
There's a new civil rights movement underway, said Wendy Kopp, president and founder of Teach For America. It has nothing to do with equal voting rights, sit-ins or marches on Washington. Instead, Kopp said she believes the most pressing civil rights issue is closing the achievement gap in education between children of different socioeconomic backgrounds. Kopp, who will speak today in the Michigan League at 4 p.m. about her experience starting the organization, said 13 million children grow up in poverty in America and only about half of those children receive a high school diploma.

Territory women have until January 27 to nominate for the 2019 AgriFuturesTM Rural Women’s Award. The Rural Women’s Award recognises the essential role women play in rural industries, businesses and communities. It provides a platform to inspire Australian women to use their skills to benefit their industries and communities and is an amazing opportunity to further leadership development, make a tangible difference and inspire others. 2018 Rural Women’s Award Northern Territory winner and national finalist Linda Blackwood from Katherine encouraged women with ideas that could make a difference in rural communities to consider applying for the 2019 Rural Women’s Award.
Leon Panetta at the C.I.A. That would appear to be the sound of gears grinding on the smooth-gliding Obamamobile. Two process errors on the same day! The first one—failing to vet Bill Richardson properly—is forgivable. Nobody vets Richardson. Perhaps I should mention that when I was recently in Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif went out of his way to cite him to me as his favorite American politician. Anyway, with a bodies-are-buried godfather of political soul like the governor of New Mexico, you appoint him and hope that he is experienced and mature enough by now to self-police.
OPINION: Joe Hildebrand is the last man to be a royalist. But what he saw in the heartland of NSW made him believe in something else. THE little girl in the park was beaming like the unexpected Dubbo sun from underneath a plastic tiara. “Why do you like Harry and Meghan?” I asked. “Because she’s a princess!” the girl shone back. That should have been the final word in the modern republican’s arsenal. “Well you can’t,” I should have told her. But of course that wouldn’t be entirely true.
A UN team investigating possible war crimes in Gaza describes testimonies presented to the mission as "difficult to hear" after holding public hearings with the victims of the conflict. On Tuesday, The fact-finding mission ended its four-day public hearings to gather witness testimony about alleged war crimes during Israel’s three-week war on the Gaza Strip. The UN inquiry team — headed by Richard Goldstone, a Jewish South African judge — held two days of public hearings in Gaza two weeks ago and another two-day in Geneva on Monday and Tuesday to give a chance to those who were not able to travel to Gaza to present their testimony.
"A Disorder Peculiar to the Country"
Ken Kalfus' ingenious new book about an explosive divorce might be the best novel yet about 9/11. Maybe you think that comparing the bitter divorce of a New York City couple to what's currently known as the war on terror is a bit overblown? I thought that myself about one passage in Ken Kalfus' brilliant new comedy of manners, "A Disorder Peculiar to the Country," in which an estranged husband walks up to his wife in their contested Brooklyn Heights two-bedroom and tries (but fails) to set off a suicide bomb.
Q: I’m a single male, 29, never married. I have a great job and good income, having pretty much followed a direct path towards it. Some of my friends are engaged or married, on tighter budgets. But it’s my closest married friend with a couple of young kids, who’s upset me recently. A group of us were invited to celebrate one friend’s 30th birthday, during a Las Vegas weekend. Everyone was excited about it but I saw that my buddy was holding back on accepting.
White Sox great Jim Thome, who was inducted last month into the Baseball Hall of Fame, waves to fans before the team's baseball game against the Indians on Aug. 11, 2018, in Chicago. Jim Thome was talking to White Sox players about eggs earlier this week. The Cubs brought a dunk tank onto the practice field Thursday so players could laugh at one of the members of their analytics department getting soaked. It’s that time of spring training, when everyone’s anxious to get going but there are still a few finishing touches needed before opening day arrives in two weeks.
A two-day hearing wrapped up today in a case that involves a Guantanamo Bay detainee suing the U.S. government over force-feedings. As Ashley Westerman reports from Washington, D.C., the case does not seek to end the practice of force-feeding at Guantanamo Bay, but rather change the way the procedure is performed. The petitioner in this case, Syrian Abu Wa’el Dhiab, is seeking a preliminary injunction over the way guards force-feed him. A 12-year detainee at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba cleared of charges in 2009, Dhiab has been on a hunger strike for the last seven years in protest of his indefinite imprisonment.
Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia has challenged key stakeholders managing the country’s athletes to re-orient their minds from just participating in athletics championships to winning medals for the nation. He said the prime focus should be to win medals that would bring glory and honour to Ghana, and not just pride themselves in having qualified to participate. “Ghana cannot continue to participate in international games for the sake of participation but her presence must be felt to show our solidarity for the growth and development of global sports,” Dr Bawumia said.
Founded by Richard Holloway in 2006, Sistema Scotland is a pioneering Scottish charity dedicated to transforming the lives of children and communities through participation in orchestras, working alongside families and local services such as education and social services to create an intensive wraparound programme. Sistema Scotland operates Big Noise programmes throughout Scotland, with four established centres in some of the most disadvantaged areas in the country, working with over 2,500 children and young people each week.

It was the world acknowledged military strategist and former Prime Minsiter of Great Britain Winston Churchill, who stated that, ‘All the great things are simple, and many can be expressed in a single word: freedom, justice, honor, duty, mercy, hope’ while to Martin Luther King Jnr. ‘Law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress’. To the famous Malcolm X, ‘Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything.
The main pro-Morsi university group, "Students against the Coup," led by Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, denied involvement in the bombings. But a leading figure in the group, Youssef Salheen, warned that excessive violence by the security forces and the broader crackdown on the Brotherhood was fueling a violent response. "All that is incitement to all those who go down to protest to turn from peacefulness to violence and terrorism because of all what they see," said the 21-year-old Salheen, a student at Cairo's Islamic Al-Azhar University, another campus that sees frequent clashes.
Eight immigration detainees who were held behind bars for more than a year have been granted their freedom after the launch of a review into a system that critics charge has long favoured incarceration and has resulted in non-citizens being left to languish in jail. Six of those long-term detainees are now out of jail, while the release of two others is imminent, a spokesperson for the Immigration and Refugee Board told the Star. In addition, two former long-term detainees have been deported following the review of 27 long-term detention cases involving inmates locked up for at least a year.
Can Twitter keep up its strong revenue growth? For the most part, 2018 was a good year for Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) business. Sure, monthly active users turned downward in Q2 and Q3. But this was due to the company's aggressive (and important) efforts to improve the health of its platform. In addition, Twitter's year-over-year revenue growth rates accelerated as the year went on. But there's still one more quarter from 2018 for Twitter to report. The company will release its fourth-quarter update on Feb. 7.
This article appears in the April 8, 2011 issue of Executive Intelligence Review. April 2—The British Empire, which rules the planet today as an imperial monetary system, stands in a long succession of empires which have successfully destroyed their subjects, and themselves, by clinging to their oligarchical ways. Today, that empire, and its servants, represent the primary obstacle to the survival of both mankind and the planet as a whole, and the job of patriots in the United States, and every other nation, is to take away their power, once and for all.
Mario? I think I’ve heard of him. Sonic? Yeah, he sounds familiar. Master Chief? Vaguely, I guess, yeah. All bad jokes aside though, there are certain mascots who you just KNOW are supposed to be a company’s pride and glory; whether you see them on commercials, cereal boxes, or in their own movies, certain characters just stand out. And then, other characters don’t. Here’s a list of the top ten mascots you probably didn’t even know were intended to be mascots at all.
WASHINGTON — Ecuador’s president is accusing Julian Assange of hosting numerous hackers at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to give them directions on how to propagate information on topics important to the WikiLeaks founder and his financiers. President Lenin Moreno also said Tuesday in Washington that arrested Swedish programmer Ola Bini was one of those hackers who visited Assange many times. Bini lives in Quito and was recently detained there. Moreno says Bini hacked cellphones and online accounts belonging to both private citizens and Ecuador’s government. Moreno made the comments at the Inter-American Dialogue during his five-day visit to Washington.
KUCHING: Nominations closing date for the Dayak Music Awards (Dama) or ‘Anugerah Muzik Dayak’ (AMD) has been extended to August 31 from July 31. STANDING TALL: A file picture of the Dama main committee meeting chaired by Snowdan Lawan, who is also Balai Ringin assemblyman (seated centre). A meeting held last Tuesday decided to extend the closing date for awards nomination to Aug 31. This date extension was anonymously agreed at the main committee meeting of the Dayak Artistes and Musicians Association (Dama) at its headquarters in Stutong last Tuesday.
Boxer Daley Ojuederie’s time in the Big Brother house has come to a premature end after he was ejected for ‘aggressive behaviour’ towards fellow housemate Hazel O’Sullivan – after an apparent play fight got out of hand. The pair had been enjoying a flirtatious relationship in the house – but things took an unpleasant turn after Daley’s threats towards her, leading to him swiftly being given the boot. And in doing so, he joins an elite club of Big Brother contestants who have also been involuntarily ‘removed’ from the house – some before they barely even had a chance to unpack.
Flaxseeds are one of the best superfoods, which are great for both nutrition as well as beauty. Although they have been getting a lot of traction for their health benefits lately - not many people know that flaxseeds are one of the earliest crops cultivated by humans. Flaxseeds are said to be rich in macronutrients like proteins and fibre, as well as micronutrients like a number of essential minerals and vitamins. They are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids and are widely consumed in numerous ways like salads, smoothies (flaxseed powder) or even raw or roasted.
Global polling and research firm, YouGov, has released its 2015 Best Brand Australia ranking, with Google nabbing the top spot. This is the first time the poll has been conducted in Australia, with a buzz rankings chart that shows the brands with the highest average buzz scores between October and December 2015. These brands were rated using YouGov BrandIndex’s buzz score and respondents were asked if they've heard anything about the brand in the last two weeks, through advertising, news or word of mouth, and if it was positive or negative.
HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam—The world's nations need to spend up to $300 million a year to contain the spread of bird flu so it doesn't cause a pandemic that could kill millions of people, global health officials warned Friday. The global response to outbreaks of bird flu in Asia over the past year has fallen far short given the threat it could pose to human health, they said. Since the problem first arose in Southeast Asia last year, bird flu has killed 45 people in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. A new case of human infection was reported in northern Vietnam on Friday.
ST. LOUIS (AP) - As the rain-swollen Mississippi River carried on its plodding retreat Friday, western Illinois farmer Joe Zumwalt wasn’t complaining about the flooding that wound up swamping a hundred or two of his 3,500 river-bottom acres of corn and soybeans. Zumwalt lost all of it just a few years ago in 2008, when two of the region’s levees couldn’t hold back the engorged river, ultimately submerging tens of thousands of acres of farmland. The economic toll of Midwest flooding - typical of this time of year - only now is trickling in.
Roger Federer has described the new International Premier Tennis League as "crazy, but fun". The 17-times Grand Slam winner says the tournament doesn't sit easily with his traditionalist views on the sport. Launched in November, top male and female players feature in teams representing four cities: New Delhi, Manila, Singapore and Dubai. Federer said: "My mind was scrambling trying to remember all the rules. It's crazy, but it's good fun." The 33-year-old went undefeated on his debut for the Indian Aces in New Delhi as a late replacement for Rafa Nadal.

Corey Bellemore, a 22-year-old college runner for the University of Windsor in Canada, smashed the beer mile world record with a time of 4:34.25 back in August ... and now he's already reaping the benefits with a deal with Three Stripes.
Wittenauer said investigators are “confident” that Taylor knew the offender or offenders, but no arrests have been made at this time. Wittenauer said Taylor was last seen alive Sunday, Dec. 6, having lunch with family members. Police believe Taylor died sometime between Dec. 6 and Dec. 7. The Major Case Squad of Greater St. Louis had been investigating the suspicious death, but disbanded Sunday. Collinsville Police Department detectives say they will continue the investigation. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Collinsville Police Department at 618-344-2131 or CrimeStoppers at 866-371-8477.
At the World Sprint Championships in 2012, Olympic gold speed skater Christine Nesbitt set a new world record in the 1,000 metres of 1:12:68 seconds. Inga Artamonova, 1960’s Soviet speed skating superstar and four-time world championship winner, had a personal best of 1:35 — a difference of nearly 23 seconds. Every generation, we feel like we’ve reached a pinnacle; skated the fastest or jumped the highest or thrown the furthest, and then the next generation always surpasses it. Like any human endeavour, sports evolve. Science and technology provide better gear, streamlined clothing, even better-designed play surfaces and tracks.

Paying off the national debt used to be an obsession of Calvinist fundamentalists on the fringes of the Republican Party, but this year it is the boldest banner held aloft by the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee. If Al Gore is taken at his word, his presidency will amass trillions of dollars in extra revenue and devote most of it to paying down the federal debt. That would represent a very conservative agenda–and an ideological sea change for the Democrats–but Gore and his economic advisers have persuaded themselves that the New Economy is real and changes everything.
It’s going to be a tough game against the Redskins on Sunday. First, I’ll state the obvious; if we’re going to win we’ve got to establish some level of control over Robert Griffin III (I think I want to call him Bob. Bob sounds somehow less fierce or formidable). Let’s face it, if Bob can dismantle the NO Saints defense, what is he going to do to us? Will our defense get more pressure on Bob than the Saints? Probably not.
NEW YORK (AP) — The First Amendment is getting a new champion, with some deep pockets. The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and Columbia University on Tuesday announced the launch of a $60 million project, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which would use litigation as well as research and education to fight for freedom of expression in an ever-evolving digital era. The last half of the 20th century saw court cases that really defined and pushed the First Amendment forward, said Alberto Ibarguen, president of Knight Foundation.
Huddleston was also part of a potent 1-2 combo. He and backcourt mate Jarrett Sparks combined to average over 45 points per game. Now, Sparks is playing football for Cal and Huddleston -- who has signed to play basketball for Pacific next year -- will be the Bears' main focus. The Modesto Metro Conference appears to be wide open, especially with the absence of top players Nate Jackson (Modesto) and Malachi Batt (Johansen) from their teams' rosters. Enochs is off to a fast start behind 6-foot-9-inch post player Marcus Banks and Beyer will contend with 6-6 center Bryan Garbez.
Strange as it seems, monthly passes for the transit system did not always exist in Montreal. When they were introduced in 1980, they were instantly popular. This photo by John Mahoney, published in the Montreal Gazette on April 2, 1980, shows Joseph Thibodeau explaining the new pass to Mathilda Routhier at Atwater métro station. The passes had gone into use the previous day, the first of the month. If there was anyone unhappy with the new system, our reporter did not find them. Everyone quoted in our story considered the passes a big improvement over tickets.
A NDF crew work to sandbag the annex building at the Nevada State Railroad Museum on Tuesday. The Nevada State Railroad Museum on Carson Street is undergoing repairs of extensive damages from the flood, as water from Curry Street had to be diverted to the property. Museum Director Dan Thielen said the annex, restoration shop and the main museum is flooded and are looking at $500,000 in repair costs. "It's been dramatic and overwhelming," he said. "But overall, we're doing good. Our collections are not destroyed."
The Israeli government will begin withholding taxes and tariffs collected on behalf of and distributed to the Palestinian Authority equal to the amount Ramallah pays to terrorists and their families. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu announced that the “necessary staff work will be completed by next week to implement” the Deduction Law passed by parliament last year, adding that “on Sunday I will convene the security cabinet and we will make the necessary decision to offset the funds.” The move comes after Arafat Irfayia confessed to last Thursday’s murder of Israeli teenager Ori Ansbacher in a forest located on the outskirts of Jerusalem.
How Much Are MLB Umpires Paid? The highest-paid umpires in Major League Baseball don't even make as much money as the lowest-paid players, but it's still a lucrative career for the fortunate few who are able to call balls and strikes for a living. The minimum salary for players in 2018 is $545,000, but several players earn more than $30 million. For the league's umpires, the minimum salary is $150,000 (plus quite a few perks), and the most experienced veterans can make $450,000 per year.
The Israel Antiquities Authority unveiled a rare ancient seal that underscores the bond of the Jewish people to Jerusalem. The Israel Antiquities Authority held a special press conference in Jerusalem's City of David on Sunday to unveil a rare coin from the Second Temple era. The cartouche – or seal – never seen by the public before, is the size of the modern New Israeli Shekel coin and bears the Aramaic inscriptions “it is pure” and a two-letter abbreviation for the name of God. It was discovered near the Robinson’s Arch at the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount.
Kirsha Kaechele receives Guardian Australia in Cinemona, the plush cinema in the basement of Hobart’s Museum of Old and New Art. The artist is reclined on a velour sofa, dressed in a canary-yellow suit with hot pants and heels. Guardian Australia has been fashioned with a gin and tonic. It’s an odd vibe when we’re here to talk about sustainability, but then, Kaechele doesn’t believe environmentalism need equate to slumming it, as evidenced by her deluxe new food and art compendium, which retails at $277.77.
With one week to go before Michigan's gubernatorial primary, Attorney General Mike Cox finds himself again denying accusations he attended a long-rumored party thrown by then-Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick at the Manoogian Mansion in 2002.
report attorney Norman Yatooma has obtained a sworn affidavit from a motorcycle club member who says he worked security at the party and saw Cox receive a lap dance and Carlita Kilpatrick assault stripper Tamara "Strawberry" Greene. Yatooma is representing Greene's family in a civil suit against Kilpatrick and the City of Detroit, alleging local leaders conspired to block an investigation into her murder, which occurred several months after the rumored party.
JEDDAH: The National Water Company (NWC), the main operator for the King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Project for Zamzam Water, plans to raise production to meet a likely increase in demand because of the expansion at the two holy mosques and more visitors this Ramadan. The company said that it had already started preparing for the increased production, including expanding maintenance, pumping and distribution operations at the Grand Mosque and Prophet’s Mosque, a local publication reported on Tuesday. The company said that each family would be allowed to get two cans of Zamzam water.
Recently, we spoke with Vibrant‘s director of communications Jonathan Gardner, who took a trip to Thailand and Taiwan and shared with us some of the trends he noticed while he was there. Gardner worked in Asia between 2001 and 2009 and has held positions with Hill & Knowlton in Hong Kong, Edelman in Taiwan (he was an MD there), and worked at media organizations in those countries as well as Bangkok, Thailand. During our conversation, Gardner talked about the importance of social media and the impact that the concept of “guanxi,” a term loosely translated to mean “relationships,” is having.
The home of Tim Menzer burns in Choctaw, Okla., on Thursday afternoon. Gusting winds and dry conditions fueled wildfires across Texas and Oklahoma on Thursday. His house surrounded by a raging wildfire scattering embers everywhere, Fred Blackwell finally had to give up the fight and evacuate. The 40-year-old oil field worker hoped he would find his house intact when he returned, but he knew better. Sure enough, Blackwell's 1920s-era brick home was among dozens destroyed by wildfires that killed at least three people and scorched more than 100,000 acres of drought-parched Texas before high winds that fanned the flames eased Friday.
The rematch of the Super Bowl with a historic finish doesn’t have much of a super look right now. The Patriots are 4-2 and have not cruised in any game, mainly because of a leaky defense. The Falcons are 3-2 and easily could have one win. Still, NBC must be salivating to have Tom Brady vs. Matt Ryan, particularly with both teams vulnerable when they don’t have the ball. And, of course, each side has memories - joyful and painful - of New England’s rally from a 25-point second-half hole to win the championship in February.
We use chemical biology to uncover biochemical mechanisms in innate immunity and, in parallel, develop therapeutic hypotheses and lead compounds. Innate immune pathways as the first line of defense against pathogens present many exciting opportunities for chemical biologists. These pathways are a rich source of novel chemistry: they involve diverse molecular patterns in pathogens, little-explored second messengers, and drugs with poorly understood mechanism. Activation of innate immunity is a proven therapeutic strategy for vaccination, viral infection, and cancer, while inhibition is a strategy for treating autoimmune diseases and sterile inflammation.
The term 'Minimalist'was so widely and loosely applied in the 1990s, whether by World of Interiors or Wallpaper* , that people lost sight of the 1960s art that first gave it currency. Not that any artists then announced themselves as Minimalists - but the label stuck. Five names usually figure when the subject is discussed: Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Dan Flavin, Carl Andre and Sol LeWitt (pictured). To these, in this lucid, accessible and thoroughly researched book, James Meyer adds a sixth - Anne Truitt, whose painted wooden sculptures are kin to more familiar '60s work.

A teacher from Clark High School got the surprise of a lifetime by Miracle Mile Shops and Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino. Ashley Nebe was honored with a makeover at Dollheads Blowdry and Extensions Bar, a $500 shopping spree and tickets to "Vegas! The Show" for her work to better educate southern Nevada students. In true Las Vegas style, the gifts were delivered by a showgirl and twin performers from the show. Her photo was also displayed on the huge electronic billboard outside the Miracle Mile Shops on the Las Vegas Strip.
Lagos — Nigerian oil company Oando aims to raise fresh capital over the next two years and repay debt used to acquire Conoco Phillips’ Nigerian assets, its CEO Adewale Tinubu said . Oando has transformed itself in the past few years from a fuel retailer to oil producer and now competes with multinationals such as Shell and ExxonMobil, but its growth has been largely built on debt. It bought Conoco Phillips’ Nigerian assets for $1.5bn in 2013, but high financing costs, coupled with lower oil prices hit profit, leaving it unable to repay its debt.
Lily Aldridge, Chrissy Teigen & Nina Agdal Grace Sports Illustrated's 50th Anniversary Swimsuit Issue! Talk about a triple threat! The coveted 50th anniversary cover of Sports Illustrated‘s Swimsuit Issue goes to models Lily Aldridge, Chrissy Teigen and Nina Agdal. Wearing only barely-there bikini bottoms, the beauties get cheeky in the golden anniversary issue as they turn to the camera and show off their perfectly toned backsides. Shot in the sunny Cook Islands, the cover is in stark comparison to the arctic temperatures last year’s cover girl Kate Upton had to endure.
Every German alive today knows the entire skit "Dinner for One" -- shown every New Year's Eve -- by heart. They are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of British humor. James and Miss Sophie in the cult New Year's classic "Dinner for One." Big in Germany, unknown in most of the rest of the world. Most Germans love meeting people from other countries -- and, as a foreigner in Germany, the first few moments of a friendly encounter can feel less like a conversation and more like an interrogation.
MSU coach Cathy George should have disassociated herself from Butler earlier, but that would have been doing something the rest of the sport wasn't. Michigan State University deserves plenty of criticism and shame for its handling of Larry Nassar, its response to his victims and its systemic failures in acting to prevent and treat sexual abuse on its campus. MSU does not deserve the shame of Rick Butler. Not on its own. Not in a headline. Not based on what we know. And not based on what those who are behind the story say.
Parent blog: Should I let my kid play tackle football? My 6-year-old son William loves sports. He currently swims, plays soccer and also flag football. This boy lives and breathes sports. I know which room he's been in because the TV is turned to ESPN. Every surface he walks on is an imaginary sports arena. Our family room is a football field and soccer stadium. The couch acts as "other players" and, in his mind, I'm always ready for a pass - whether I'm looking or not. Ouch.
Trio Martinu are the next guests of the Funtington Music Group for a concert at the Chichester University Chapel of the Ascension on Wednesday, November 14 at 7.30pm. FMG chairman Chris Hough said: “The world-famous Trio Martinu was formed at the Prague Conservatoire in 1990. The award-winning ensemble have won numerous prizes over the years and thrilled audiences from Tokyo to Toronto, recently performing in the Leamington Spa Chamber Music and Petworth Festivals in the UK and the Portland Summer Festival in the USA. FMG are delighted to provide an exciting opportunity to hear the ensemble in Chichester.
When two dancers from the same Jacksonville show bar turned up dead, investigators believed it might have been the work of a serial killer. One of those cases was solved but the other was not and now, decades later, investigators believe a murderer may still be on the loose. In an Action News Jax partnership with the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office and Project: Cold Case, we spoke with the victim’s sister and the detectives working on the case. At the corner of University Boulevard South and Philips Highway there was a club called Sands Speakeasy Showbar.
Vogue is on trend once again, featuring Austin in a recent article on the city’s newest and most notable design destinations. In the magazine’s story, A Design-Lover’s Guide to Austin: 6 Must-See New Destinations, Catherine Dash highlights the architecture and composition of the hottest culinary and boutique locales fresh on the scene. Although positioned to those traveling through Austin, these “aesthetically focused hot spots” should also be on any local’s bucket list for where to eat, shop, play, and stay.
The BMW X2 concept presented at the 2016 Paris Motor Show is a compact vehicle that previews the German luxury carmaker's new design tenet. Clearly contoured volumes and subtle edges create a front-end impression with presence and sporting appeal in abundance. The heavily raked windscreen appears to extend seamlessly into the dark panoramic roof and teams up with the newly interpreted double kidney grille and large air intakes to give the front end a slow-slung look. While its large wheels and familiar two-box design underline its functional X model character, a long wheelbase, stretched roofline, short overhangs and heavily forward-slanting C-pillar give the body a sporty, low-to-the-road feel.
FAIRBORN, Ohio — A 911 call during a regularly-scheduled installation exercise prompted a lockdown at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on Thursday. According to the base's Twitter account, officials were executing an active shooter training exercise in Area A of the base on Thursday when an "unknown individual" called 911, fearing the training was real. The call prompted a security sweep of the base and a lockdown call. Later, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base later clarified that there was never a "real world" active shooter on the base. There was no real world active shooter incident on Wright-Patterson AFB and base personnel remain safe.
Peter Dale, chef at The National restaurant in downtown Athens, will orchestrate this year’s medley of food planned for Athens Land Trust’s fourth annual Harvest Moon dinner under the stars Friday night. The annual dinner serves as the signature fundraiser for ALT, a nonprofit organization founded in 1994 to promote quality of life by preserving land, creating energy-efficient and affordable housing, and revitalizing neighborhoods. Seating is limited to 120 people, and ALT has about 15 tickets left, said ALT board member Lara Mathes, who started the event with her husband, Tony Eubanks.
TAKE a look at the 1991 Paraguayan telephone directory and there under "S" is the phone number of Alfredo Stroessner. The listing is a bit of a surprise since General Stroessner has been unavailable to take calls for two years. A coup on Feb. 3,1989, ended his 35 years as Paraguay's generalissimo and dispatched him to exile in Brazil. Look under "R," and there is as yet no entry for Gen. Andr 142&amp;gt;s Rodriguez Pedotti, the man who led the coup and the country's current president.

Around The NFL's season preview looks to the AFC West. There was a lot of change in Kansas City this offseason, but it's hard to believe it was for the better. Nearly 7,000 starter snaps walked out the door, with the biggest blow happening to the offensive line. Branden Albert, Geoff Schwartz and Jon Asamoah all signed big deals elsewhere. Last year's No. 1 overall pick Eric Fisher will replace Albert at left tackle, and the early results aren't promising.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is providing a 152 million euro ($187 million) loan to the municipal company that operates the metro system in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine, the bank said Friday. The project, which is expected to be co-financed on an equal basis by the European Investment Bank, will finance completion of the existing metro line, which will extend the line by 4 kilometers and add three new metro stations. On project completion, metro traffic flow is expected to double to over 20 million people by 2026, while also providing much-needed congestion relief to the busiest part of Dnipropetrovsk city center.
UPDATE: Lancaster County District Attorney, Craig Stedman says Thursday was one of the darkest days in Lancaster County. He says the family knew the suspect and called him, "Pie." Stedman says Thomas was arrested in April and charged with sexual assault against one of the victims and another girl. He was presumed innocent but Stedman says his previous sexual assault charges could have led him to the stabbings. Police say canines used the scent of blood from in the victims' home to track the suspect's scent at his nearby home. DA Stedman says this case is a "hallmark for the death penalty."
President Trump on Tuesday again dismissed the climate crisis. President Trump on Tuesday promoted a quote that calls the climate crisis "fake." "Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace: 'The whole climate crisis is not only Fake News, it's Fake Science. @foxandfriends Wow!" Trump wrote in a tweet. Greenpeace USA was quick to correct the record, writing: "Patrick Moore was not a co-founder of Greenpeace. He does not represent Greenpeace. He is a paid lobbyist, not an independent source. His statements about @AOC & the #GreenNewDeal have nothing to do with our positions."
Welcome to Vavaâ€™u, and I wish to offer you all, my warmest greetings, and congratulations on your agreement in Pohnpei last year to have the Forum Trade Ministers Meeting here in Vavaâ€™u, the only second island to embrace the title â€˜The Great Vavaâ€™uâ€, after 'Great Britain'. Vavaâ€™u is not only â€˜Greatâ€™ but also a safe place in times of natural disasters, and is therefore known as the Port of Refuge. As such it is a fitting venue for Ministers from the region to gather and discuss the very full agenda of trade related matters.
Eliza MacLean arrived to class a few minutes late. Her hair was pulled back in a loose ponytail, sunglasses gripped her head, her jeans and boots showed the telltale signs of muddy farm life. She said she had just driven from her farm, Cane Creek in Snow Camp, N.C., where she'd given a farm tour and the questions ran late. Now she was on Duke's campus to face still more questions, this time from students in the university's food studies class. A sampling of some of the meals served during the food studies course.
Stephen Colbert IDs New Threat: "Stoned Pat Robertson"
"We must stop Pat before The 700 Club becomes The 420 Club." Stephen Colbert has identified a new national menace—and this time it isn't bears. Two weeks ago, cannabis enthusiasts got an unlikely new ally in the crusade for marijuana legalization: famed televangelist Pat Robertson, a Christian Right mainstay otherwise known for his decidedly non-progressive stances on feminism, homosexuality, abortion, and the Muslim faith. "It's time we stop locking up people for possession of marijuana," the 81-year-old broadcaster said on the Mar.
Given that the port’s bond payments are set to exceed $35 million next year, lenders are insisting on about $1 million a year in extra interest fees for the new debt without additional backing from taxpayers, said Ed Marquez, deputy mayor for finance. “The seaport is not as rich as we’d like it to be,” he said. Beckham’s negotiators see the port’s development plan as too ambitious, and are pitching a soccer stadium as crucial for stimulating development on the southwest corner.
We have some great news for those of you on Xbox now, as Activision and Microsoft have decided to offer something of a great treat for this weekend. For this weekend only, you’ll be able to play COD Ghosts multiplayer online for free, no questions asked. In an interesting move, this will actually mark the first occasion where a free Call of Duty demo has been offered on console. Unsurprisingly, this is Xbox only on either Xbox 360 or Xbox One with no information whatsoever on the same deal taking place for PS3 and PS4 users.
A recent late-night walk with my border collie Zoe has transported me back to one of the darkest, dreariest days of my 30-year journalistic career. Following her gaze down a utility easement east of Bryan Park a half mile south of downtown Bloomington, I saw a young whitetail deer, frozen by our presence, hauntingly backlit by a streetlight half a block to the south. Since then, I have read documents from, and stories about, the Bloomington-Monroe County Deer Task Force, which is poised to recommend that city deer be shot.
Here in the land of the Metroliner and the Coach Coast Starlight, it's easy to be jealous of all the national rail systems that leave Amtrak in the dust. Now Japan, already home to one of the world's most sophisticated networks, has given us something new to envy – a greener train that does 217 mph. Kawasaki Heavy Industries is developing the "Environmentally Friendly Super Express Train" and says it will be Japan's fastest passenger train ever. It features an extremely light and aerodynamic profile and uses regenerative braking to capture kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost as heat.
NEW YORK Unlike most economic data from the U.S. government, the monthly unemployment rate isn't usually revised later. If, for example, the Labor Department says the rate was 7.7 percent in a particular month, that rate normally stays 7.7 percent. Every January, the government updates the formulas it uses to calculate unemployment data. The new formulas can change some of the rates for the previous five years. Typically, though, only few of the monthly rates are revised. On Friday, the government revised the unemployment rates for two months in 2012.
As a 26-year-veteran of the National Parks Service, this isn’t the first time Lora Williams has been furloughed during a government shutdown and had to make ends meet without a paycheck. And as the shutdown over Donald Trump’s border wall barrels into its third week, when it would become the longest in US history, the weight of that uncertainty is being disproportionately shouldered by black Americans like Williams. Black people make up 12% of the US population, but more than 18% of the federal workforce, according to a study by the Partnership for Public Service.
Dean Keates will study for the final two years of his sports coaching degree at Glyndŵr University after being released by Wrexham. The former Dragons captain and midfielder will also coach the Glyndŵr Wrexham Football Academy. "There has been interest from several clubs but I'm 37 soon and this is the natural next step for me," Keates said. "I could still play part-time as well as coaching and studying, so I'm not hanging up my boots just yet." Keates is one of several players released by Wrexham manager Gary Mills following the end of the season.
We've seen it numerous times, where a bug leads Google to either show too many Google Ads in the search results or the organic listings do not load and Google only shows ads. It is rare, but we see it every now and then. Google recently confirmed a bug where they showed too many ads in the mobile results. Google said on Twitter "Thanks for catching this! We didn't intend to show these extra ads. This was a bug impacting a very small number of queries and it has already been fixed." Thanks for catching this!
The economic slump hit the restaurant business hard: diners cut back, and investors practically stopped putting money into startups. In London, that led to a boom in “pop-up” dining — places where top-notch chefs temporarily took over alternative spaces, from friends’ apartments to greasy spoons to construction sites. This is fine dining’s equivalent to the speakeasy — a hot ticket available only to foodies in the know. We travel to Victoria Park in hip East London, where up-and-coming Scottish chef Isaac McHale has been running Elliot’s in the Park every Friday night in a casual cafe.
Vladimir Putin is coming to town. His hosts are expecting $20 billion in new contracts, but what does he want in return? The capital of Uzbekistan has gone Russian for the week – even the weather has turned cold and snowy. Tashkent is decked out in red-blue-and-white flags. Roads in the center are lined with billboards carrying the words: “Welcome Russian friends!” Even buses have been emblazoned with the flags of Russia and Uzbekistan – an unprecedented sight. This outpouring of Russophilia is in anticipation of President Vladimir Putin’s two-day visit, which begins on October 18.

A recent case involved a 37-year-old woman who wanted to start her own business, so she bought a visa from a broker for Dh10,000. ABU DHABI // Filipinos who are unable to find work or have left their jobs to run a business have resorted to buying UAE visas despite the risks of jail time and deportation. A recent case involving a Filipina caught with an illegally acquired visa has highlighted the problem. The 37-year-old woman, who worked at a coffee shop for two years, bought a visa for about Dh10,000 from a broker in November last year.
Hingoli (Maharashtra), Nov 10 (IANS) A jobless suitor in a Maharashtra village stabbed a man to death after he rejected him his daughter's hand in marriage, police said here on Saturday. Another relative was also grievously injured in the late Friday incident in the Datada-Budruk village, when Sachin Narayan Surnar attacked Kailash Shinde at his home. Surnar wanted to marry Shinde's daughter and had expressed his desire to the girl's brother, police official Rohini Ingole said. Amol K. Shinde wanted to take his father's consent on this.
Why Does God Allow Tragedy and Suffering? A preacher reflects on a local mass shooting. Editor’s Note: Originally published in 2012, the following is adapted from a sermon preached in response to the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado by author and apologist Lee Strobel on Sunday, July 22, at Cherry Hills Community Church in Highlands Ranch, Colorado. It's already being called the worst mass shooting in American history: 70 people shot by a gunman, 12 of them killed, while they were watching the midnight showing of a new movie.
Tim Henman brought a fitting end to his competitive career at the All England Club by steering Great Britain back into the Davis Cup World Group for the first time in four years. Henman teamed up with Jamie Murray to win the doubles rubber 4-6 6-4 7-6 (7-3) 7-5 over Croatia’s Marin Cilic and Lovro Zovko and secure GB an unassailable 3-0 lead with two rubbers remaining. The capacity Court One crowd rose to acclaim Henman after his whipped cross-court forehand converted Great Britain’s first match point and sealed a thoroughly convincing two-day victory. Henman admitted he could not have scripted his farewell any better.
Tomb Raider was in a creative rut last we saw it, with stagnant gameplay and a dull lead character. However, Lara Croft has undergone quite a transformation in the five years since Tomb Raider Underworld. The new Lara might not be recognizable to the fans who knew her way back when but these changes are for the best. In the game, Lara Croft is no longer the back-flipping, expert treasure hunter with uzis in each hand. Instead, she's a fresh-faced graduate on her first journey. Minutes after the game starts, she's shipwrecked on an island populated by wolves, murderous salvagers and other dangers.
For all its dazzling natural beauty, its medieval towns and unspoilt villages, the Spis region of eastern Slovakia is virtually unknown in Britain. And I, too, might never have heard of it if an ex from the region hadn't taken me there eight years ago. That relationship might have ended, but my love affair with the place, its gregarious people and laid-back way of life, endures. And although English translations are slowly creeping into menus alongside the German and Polish entries, this remains one of the last corners of Europe where a British traveller is an exotic rarity.
Illinois has become the first American state to ban cosmetics containing microplastics. The move has been taken in response to growing concern over the marine damage caused by plastic waste, which a report published recently by the U.N. Environment Programme puts at $13 billion or more annually. Among the products that will be removed from Illinois shelves are several brands of exfoliating face wash. While natural versions of this popular product use the likes of oatmeal or ground kernels as an exfoliant, cheap commercial varieties use nonbiodegradable plastic beads, known as microbeads. One average-sized tube can hold thousands of them.
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) Darren Collison threw the early scoring punches. Victor Oladipo delivered the decisive second-half flurry. Together, the Indiana Pacers' starting guards were a knockout combination.

Most Portlanders will tell you they want pesticides banned from parks. They want native plants in greenspaces where children, pets and wildlife can roam safely. But when it's time to set aside chemical sprays such as Roundup and spend hours weeding, only a handful of residents stand ready with rakes and shovels. View full sizeCentral City ConcernFrederick Wallace (left) and Leonard Brightmon of Central City Concern took part last fall in a volunteer work crew that weeds Lair Hill Park. Efforts to go pesticide-free at other Portland parks, however, have suffered from a lack of volunteers.
With Facebook’s introduction of bots on Messenger last month, chatbots, which have been around for decades, have suddenly taken the leap from fun toy project to cutting-edge business proposition. With this rapid rise to prominence, it’s critical to differentiate the hype from the true value bots can offer when you consider using one for your business. Here are some best practices to make sure your chatbot development project succeeds and doesn’t turn into another Tay, the short-lived, bigoted A.I.-powered bot we came to know and fear.
Former first lady Michelle Obama criticized President Donald Trump for the morals he governs with during her appearance on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” Friday night. She was on the show to promote her new memoir “Becoming.” Obama took numerous shots at the president in her book, saying she’d “never forgive” Trump for questioning President Barack Obama’s birth place. The conversation shifted as Michelle Obama shared an anecdote of how she felt leaving the White House on Air Force One at the end of President Obama’s eight years in office.

Almost every workplace has at least one toxic employee. You know the type — always negative, tends to bully others, distracts much of the team. But what if someone were to tell you that you are that person? Before you balk in denial, take a look at some of these common traits that awful employees tend to have. If they uncomfortably hit home, there are steps you can take to rectify the situation before your toxic tendencies can ruin your career. 1. You make everything about you. This is something most people are guilty of at least once in their lives.
This might sound painfully obvious, but it bears repeating: The best way to reduce homelessness in Dallas is to provide stable shelter for those down on their luck. Dallas has not done a good job of this, partly because the homeless population greatly exceeds available resources. Emergency shelters provide homeless individuals a temporary place to sleep. As a community, however, our goal must be to move people quickly from the streets to temporary facilities and into housing where they can get a fresh start and the services they need. A recent initiative gives us hope.
BB&T banking customers found themselves locked out of accounts and ATM access. Branches also were offline after equipment failure at a data center. If you've got a BB&T‏ bank account, chances are you're not happy. Customers in Louisville and other states besides Kentucky, including the bank's home base in Winston Salem, North Carolina, were locked out of online banking starting Thursday night after an "equipment malfunction" in one of the company's data centers. By mid-day Friday, the bank reported it had identified the problem and was racing to resolve it.
There are infinite paintings, but also a more finite sense of what is a great painting versus not. Similarly there are infinite games, but also a sense of what works and what doesn’t. The boundless space of video games is bounded and their limitless possibilities have limits. There are, it seems, rules to game design. “Creative constant” is a term that I use to describe those rules. They are the foundational, shape-describing pragmatic realities that we designers run into. I call them constants rather than limits because limits sound like arbitrary rules meant to be broken.

In the right conditions, driving is one of life's great pleasures. But the costs that come with filling the tank and insurance coverage can take the fun out of it altogether. To find out where in America drivers suffer the most, CarInsurance.com compiled an "Automotive Misery Index," comparing gas prices, insurance rates, and average miles driven with each state's median household income. New Hampshire came out on top, with a "misery index" of just 4.4 percent - two and half points below the country's 7 percent rating overall.
Donald Trump just contradicted his own ridiculously implausible claim not to have known Matt Whitaker’s hostility toward the Russia investigation before naming him as acting attorney general. And that was less than one minute after Trump repeated the obvious lie. If there’s anyone who seriously believes Trump's claim that he didn’t appoint Whitaker to the post of acting attorney general without knowing his views on the Russia investigation, then I’ve got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you. But don’t take my word for it, take Trump’s words on Fox News Sunday today.
1 What Is Peppermint Oil Good For? 4 Is Horseradish Good for You? Oil of oregano is touted by many natural health enthusiasts as nature’s most powerful antibiotic, but its purported benefits don’t stop there. This herbal concoction is used both internally and topically for a plethora of health-promoting purposes. As the name would suggest, oil of oregano is extracted from the oregano herb, with the use of steam distillation. It is commonly sold in health food stores and usually found in dark, glass bottles. Oil of oregano can cause more harm than good if used indiscriminately.
Remember when this snap of Hugh Grant, his broken down car and an ex-News of the World reporter who gave him a lift seemed merely photograph evidence of the funniest little anecdote to come out of English countryside? The event wound up leading to a crucial break in the News of the World phone hacking scandal. Mr. Grant later went undercover (as undercover as a celebrity can) to reporter Paul McMullen’s pub, stealth recorder-pen in hand, to make him dish on the phone hacking tactics he’d “boasted” about during their cruise, according to a video on BBC.
Microsoft officially unveiled its new global game streaming technology called “Project xCloud” on Monday. Microsoft is testing the tech out today, it said in a blog post. Project xCloud runs on devices paired with an Xbox Wireless Controller via Bluetooth and it’s playable using touch input. It’s complementary to Microsoft’s ongoing work with console hardware, which means developers can use it to deploy and dramatically scale access to their games on xCloud with no additional work. Scaling and building out the technology is “a multi-year journey,” Microsoft said.

A letter of recommendation for Eusebius, and a plea that Sophronius champion him against calumny. TO reckon up all those who have received kindness at your excellency's hand, for my sake, is no easy task; so many are there whom I feel that I have benefited through your kind aid, a boon which the Lord has given me to help me in these very serious times. Worthiest of all is he who is now introduced to you by my letter, the reverend brother Eusebius, attacked by a ridiculous calumny which it depends upon you alone in your uprightness, to destroy.
This month some important Walmart news did not get the attention it deserved. The news wasn't some flashy announcement about virtual reality or about some new service for busy Manhattanites. It was something much more subtle and much more substantive. It was the hire of Valerie Casey. Google "Valerie Casey" even today and only two listings make mention of her newfound connection with Walmart on the first page of the returned search results. This amount of attention is unjustifiably slight. Let this piece then serve as the hire's coming out party.
ARSENAL appear to be lukewarm in their interest for Mattia Perin. The Pescara shot stopper has been on the Gunners' radar, who are weighing up whether to get an understudy for Wojciech Szczesny. Barcelona and AC Milan are among the European clubs keeping tabs on him. Perin carries a £17.4m price tag, which could deter Arsene Wenger. Perin's agent, Matteo Roggi, told Italian football website calciomercato: "We have not had direct contact with any club but I know that Arsenal sent their observers several times to follow him closely and that there are many other clubs interested.

EPA officials confirmed Sunday that its researchers would not present at the State of Narragansett Bay and Its Watershed program but did not offer an explanation for the decision. "EPA scientists are attending, they simply are not presenting, it is not an EPA conference," EPA spokesman John Konkus said in an email. The New York Times first reported the cancellations.
Ohio health officials are urging families with children to eat better and get more exercise after finding 1 in 3 schoolchildren screened last year was overweight or obese. The finding came from Body Mass Index, or BMI, screenings from 213 school districts across the state participating in the new program. They tested students in kindergarten, third, fifth and ninth grades. The review found the highest percentage of overweight and obesity among 9th graders. Nearly 4 percent of kindergarteners were underweight. State Sen. Eric Kearney, who pushed for the screenings, said Ohio families should consider trying to reduce the sugary drinks and snack foods kids receive.
Hollywood and other parts of Los Angeles were left without power for two hours on Monday after workers accidentally overloaded a power line. Police declared an emergency as traffic lights went blank and lifts stopped. The city's international airport had to switch to emergency power. After initial confusion and fears of a terror attack, the fault was traced to a power surge from a receiving station. Al-Qaeda has reportedly made a recent threat to attack the Californian city. Ron Deaton, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said city maintenance workers had accidentally cut a line at a receiving station.
In an attempt to incorporate all the disciplines of engineering, Rick Connell and his engineering class at St. John�s High School have assembled an electric bike. Another group of students installed the throttle switch to the handlebars, Mr. Connell added. As the final project for the advanced placement engineering class, the students had to evaluate how the energy went in and out of the electric bike and how long they could travel on it before they had to recharge, utilizing the various engineering and physics principles used by the bicycle. The electric bike can travel approximately 20 mph and can be ridden for about two hours before the battery is exhausted.

The Linux kernel now includes everything that is needed to use 3D acceleration with all GeForce graphics chips. Drivers have also been added for a Wireless Gigabit chip and a PCIe WLAN chip from Realtek. In his email announcing the release of Linux 3.8-rc6, Linus Torvalds emphasised that he wanted the seventh release candidate to be the last one. When he released RC7 on Friday, however, he made no mention of whether there would be an eighth RC before the final version of Linux 3.8. As long as no more major problems arise, though, the Linux kernel 3.8 should still be released this month.

Andy Samberg never stops never stopping, so he’s ready to hit us with another mockumentary in which he is both starring and producing— Tour de Pharmacy. The short HBO comedy (less than an hour) will take the viewer into the cutthroat world of professional bike racing, as older “cyclists” reminisce about their glory days (the competition in question is back in 1982), which seem to have shades of Pumping Iron mixed with Talladega Nights. A major theme, if the title didn’t tip you off, is performance-enhancement drug jokes, but Lance Armstrong has a cameo, so no hard feelings.
This European Space Agency image shows the five candidate landing sites on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for the Philae lander aboard the Rosetta spacecraft. ESA scientists will unveil the target landing site on Sept. 15, 2014. Philae will make its historic landing on the comet on Nov. 11, if all goes well. The target drop zone for a historic landing on a comet in deep space by a European spacecraft will be unveiled this month after weeks of scrutiny to scout out the perfect location. Scientists with the European Space Agency will reveal the comet landing site target for Philae, a lander riding aboard the agency's Rosetta spacecraft, on Sept. 15.

The 411: The founding chapter of Echelon turned out in record numbers for the fourth annual affair, where they imbibed, dined, and listened to music by the Inside Out Band. Many of them also wore #Echelon30M branded sunglasses as they partied. And there was much to celebrate: This past year, the group focused service efforts on youth education (at events like Teen Night at the Cedar Crest Community Center) and adult addiction and recovery, by working alongside members of the Adult Rehabilitation Center in the donation processing warehouse. Echelon was founded in 2010 as an effort to mobilize the next generation of Salvation Army volunteers.
Businesswoman Karen Handel won Georgia&apos;s special House election in its 6th district on Tuesday, according to AP projections. Handel defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff in Georgia’s special House election to take the seat vacated when Tom Price was appointed Health and Human Services Secretary. Handel, 55, fought a close race against Ossoff in order to keep Georgia’s 6th district in the hands of the GOP. The seat has been held by Republicans since Newt Gingrich won it in 1978 — but multiple polls initially showed Ossoff with a narrow lead.

Have a Barney costume lying around? Think twice before you put it on. Alabama teenager Darby Risner was trying to pull a prank by wearing the big purple dinosaur costume when the massive mask got stuck on her head and shoulders. Her friends tried to help her out, but only exacerbated the situation by pulling her in both directions -- and of course, being the teenagers they are, they took a video and posted it on Twitter. When the group was unsuccessful in helping to free Risner, they had to go with her to the fire station where firefighters removed the Barney mask.
Why are you running and why should people vote for you? Like many others in our community, I have an interest in how our city operates and the direction it’s taken. Prior to first being elected alderman in Ward 1 four years ago, our neighborhood faced unacceptable issues. We re-established the Oakland Neighborhood Watch Association, where I was elected president. We initiated programs designed to bring neighbors together, improve safety and awareness to reduce crime and due to our many successes, I was asked to run for alderman. I did and won against an opponent that had been unable to address our concerns.

Former president Bill Clinton's disclosure yesterday that foreign governments and state-sponsored agencies have donated between $75 million and $165 million to his foundation highlighted a series of potential conflicts that Hillary Rodham Clinton could face should she become secretary of state. The kingdom of Saudi Arabia made one of the largest contributions, between $10 million and $25 million, as did the Australian government's overseas aid program and a Dominican Republic agency that fights AIDS. The William J. Clinton Foundation also raised more than $1 million each from the governments of Brunei, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that Gov. Andrew Cuomo's decision to withhold federal Disproportionate Share Hospital payments from the city public hospital system "makes no sense." "This is not normal and there is no excuse for it," de Blasio said during an unrelated press conference in Manhattan. It was the first time de Blasio publicly commented on the latest spat between the city and state, one the mayor said could "undermine health care in this city."

In his letter to the Romans, Paul wrote, "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 6:23). This single sentence neatly summarizes the Christian doctrine of atonement, which teaches that the reconciliation of sinful humanity with the God of love was accomplished by God in the sacrifice of His son, Jesus Christ, on the cross. Christianity teaches that God hates sin and will punish the transgressor. It is in the nature of humans to sin, so all people risk separation from God, the source of all life and love.
Abstract polygons will be flying over your head as you shoot your way through psychedelic tunnels this fall. Rez Infinite, the remastered version of the cult rail-shooter Rez, which originally debuted back in 2001 for Dreamcast and PlayStation 2, will be released this year on October 13, the same date as PlayStation VR. Rez Infinite was first introduced at PlayStation Experience in December 2015, together with a slew of other games coming to the headset. Development is in progress at Q Entertainment, the studio behind titles like puzzle games Lumines and Every Extend Extra.
Immediate termination occurs due to serious offenses by employees. The shift from conservative attire to business casual attire in the workplace is more difficult than many employers believed it would be, due to the ambiguous nature of the term "business casual." Consequently, employers routinely address concerns about inappropriate workplace attire, which in some cases, can be a sensitive topic to broach. Implementing a dress code and showing employees the effects of dressing inappropriately for work is the beginning of encouraging employees to dress in a professional, yet relaxed manner. Review your employee handbook and workplace policies for dress code guidelines.
Sean Scannell's first-half strike put Huddersfield on the verge of Championship safety by edging out Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. Terriers keeper Alex Smithies saved from the home side's Tyler Walker and Michael Mancienne, while the away side's James Vaughan headed over. It was a fourth winless game for Forest manager Dougie Freedman, who is due to sign a long-term deal this weekend. Huddersfield substitute Ishmael Miller went close late on. Winger Chris Burke was the biggest threat for Forest, setting up Mancienne's headed chance, testing Smithies with a low shot and firing two other efforts narrowly wide.
Genetic residue from ancient viral infections has been repurposed to play a vital role in acquiring pluripotency, the developmental state that allows a fertilized human egg to become all the cells in the body. Genetic material from ancient viral infections is critical to human development, according to researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine. They’ve identified several noncoding RNA molecules of viral origins that are necessary for a fertilized human egg to acquire the ability in early development to become all the cells and tissues of the body. Blocking the production of this RNA molecule stops development in its tracks, they found.
A road through the centre of Halesworth in Suffolk will be closed for 3 days next month as part of ongoing repairs to two Grade II listed buildings which were seriously damaged in a fire last June. The fire, which started within the first floor flat of No 29 Market Place and spread to the adjoining Mansion House, devastated a number of businesses and caused significant inconvenience to the town centre and surrounding area. Since the fire, demolition contractors have been working to strip parts of the historic building fabric that cannot be preserved, under the watch of local conservation officers and structural engineers.
Lt. Robert Stock has been trained for on demand emergency attention, which includes crowd control, as part of UTPD’s Mobile Field Force, formed in 2015. The force aims to be better prepared in the event of student protest or civil disorder. Last fall was marked by multiple student protests, including the Young Conservatives of Texas tabling on West Mall and Turning Point USA’s debate with Charlie Kirk. In the case protests become violent or involve criminal activity, the UT Police Department has two forms of crisis response: the Mobile Field Force and de-escalation.
Atlanta traffic was heavier than usual Friday. By early afternoon Friday, interstate highways and key roads throughout metro Atlanta already were heavy with traffic. Easter weekend and spring break getaway combined will have that effect. “Expect delays throughout the weekend,” the WSB 24-hour Traffic Center tweeted. “It's already underway,” said Doug Turnbull, traffic reporter for News 95.5 and AM 750. “I-75 northbound in Cobb is slow from I-285 to Kennesaw, I-75 southbound is packed from Lake Allatoona to Kennesaw. RELATED: Why is it called Good Friday and what’s so good about it?
Iron-red agates are the oldest collectibles you can find in Minnesota, if you know where and when to look. Gems among gravel, agates are glacial-tumbled layers of chalcedony formed within pockets of hardened lava one billion years ago. Moose Lake, 100 miles north of the Twin Cities, is the Agate Capitol of the World and home to an annual agate festival. You can find both raw agates and polished specimens during Agate Days. Each year on the third weekend in July, Moose Lake hosts a festival as unique as the area’s glacial deposits.
During LeBron James’ back-to-back championship winning tenure in Miami, rival Joakim Noah famously referred to King James and the Heat as “Hollywood as hell.” Over the summer, James fully embraced his inner producer by relocating to Los Angeles and jump-starting the Spurs-Lakers rivalry that had remained dormant since 2013. After a string of untimely backcourt injuries during the preseason, NBA pundits are predicting that San Antonio’s 21-season playoff streak is likely at its end, with James and his “Meme Team” among the squads supplanting the Spurs in the pre-season.
A couple of big publications have issued their pre-season national rankings — and no shock, Glades Central is including. I was a little surprised, however, to see the Raiders at No. 5 in the USA Today poll. Two-time defending Class 5A champion Lakeland is No. 3 in that poll, one spot behind Byrnes High — the team Glades Central plays in Duncan, S.C. on Saturday. Check out the rest of the USA Today poll here. Glades Central is at No. 20 in the Sports Illustrated poll that also came out this week.
People who suffer from sleep apnea and are very tired during the day may be more likely to develop heart disease, a new study finds. Researchers classified people with sleep apnea into four groups based on their symptoms, including those with disturbed sleep, those minimally symptomatic, those moderately sleepy, and those excessively sleepy. They found that compared with others, excessively sleepy participants were more than three times as likely to develop heart failure and twice as likely to have a heart attack, heart failure, stroke or cardiovascular death during follow-up.

Jose Reina believes Liverpool have been reduced to challenging for fourth place in the Premiership. Goalkeeper Reina conceded that Sunday's 3-0 defeat at Arsenal has ruled them out of the title race with Liverpool 14 points adrift of leaders Manchester United. He said: 'Fourth place is our target now. We have to fight for that. The championship is probably too far away for us because, mathematically, United and Chelsea are so superior. Yossi Benayoun will risk angering manager Alan Pardew by ignoring West Ham's plea for him not to play for Israel this week.
Mike Carson, second from left, and other members of the Empire-Fagan Coalition continue to take on mining interests in Davidson Canyon. For five years, Mike Carson and other members of the Empire-Fagan Coalition have been telling anyone who'll listen that there's something remarkable about the ocotillo-covered hills of Davidson Canyon, southeast of Tucson, and that the area deserves protection from mining leases approved by the Arizona State Land Department. Someone is finally paying attention. Two government agencies have weighed in on a 404 permit application filed by California Portland Cement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Fleabane is a spontaneous urban plant in the daisy family. New York City landscape architect David Seiter is on a mission to emphasize the aesthetic and environmental benefits of what he calls "spontaneous urban plants" — what most of us call weeds. These trees aren’t accounted for as urban trees, yet there's a forest of them, Seiter points out. “They just are happening in smaller, discrete locations, and in locations that don't really qualify as green space — things like walls, streets, sidewalks and roofs.

SMRT's decision to extend amnesty to staff who come forward to admit to wrongdoing has placed the spotlight on company amnesties. Such amnesties, while rare, have been used by companies in other parts of the world. They tend to be offered in the midst of a major company crisis. In 2015, scandal-hit car producer Volkswagen offered amnesty to staff in an attempt to get a hold on its emissions-cheating problem. Chief executive Herbert Diess wrote to staff promising they would not be fired or face claims of damages. He, however, added that he could not protect staff from criminal prosecution.
Beer Bust: Is Montgomery County Liquor Control Getting Worse Instead of Better? The next time you order a glass of wine or a bottle of beer in Montgomery County, will you actually get it? A growing number of restaurants say "maybe not," and they’re blaming the government. Mike Jones of American Tap Room in Bethesda recently invited the News4 I-Team to his restaurant to show why he thinks Montgomery County’s Department of Liquor Control is hurting his business at a key time as the weather brings in more customers.
CULPEPER COUNTY, Va. – Twenty-two years after a graduate student went missing in Virginia, state police are hopeful someone can help identify her killer. Alicia Showalter Reynolds was last seen alive on March 2, 1996, driving along Route 29 from Baltimore to Charlottesville. Her Mercury Tracer was found abandoned later that same day in Culpeper County. The Johns Hopkins University graduate student's remains were discovered in a field that had recently been cleared of trees in the rural town of Lignum two months later. Detectives have received more than 10,000 leads in the 25-year-old's disappearance, yet no one has ever been convicted for her murder.
COLUMBUS, Ohio — Columbus is the only Ohio city still in competition for Amazon's multibillion-dollar second headquarters. The online retailer announced Thursday that it has narrowed its list of possible locations to 20. Cleveland and Cincinnati also put in bids for the planned headquarters, but didn't make the cut. Amazon said 238 cities submitted proposals for the project that the Seattle-based retailer says could lead to a $5 billion investment and 50,000 new jobs. Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther said in a statement Thursday that Columbus provides the skilled workforce, educational institutions, infrastructure and culture of collaboration needed and will continue to "compete hard."
Installing solar and wind power in the Sahara would have benefits for both the region and the world’s electrical grids, a new paper concludes. The study, reported in the journal Science on September 7, 2018, is among the first to model the climate effects of wind and solar installations while taking into account how vegetation responds to changes in heat and precipitation, said lead author Yan Li, a postdoctoral researcher in natural resources and environmental sciences at the University of Illinois. Energy generation by wind and solar farms could reduce carbon emissions and thus mitigate anthropogenic climate change.
In addition, Kelowna made it illegal for people to give away empty bottles or cans that can be redeemed for cash within 500 meters of a recycling depot, again bringing a $250 fine for offenders. Kelowna hopes people will instead return recyclables themselves and contribute to organizations to that help the homeless, Kelowna mayor Colin Basran said. Kelowna is not the first city in the region to attempt to deal with the issue of panhandling. In November, the Gig Harbor City Council passed a new ordinance making it unlawful for drivers to interact with pedestrians or exchange money or goods on certain roadways.
Ten presidents have stayed at the Riverside landmark throughout the decades. Ten presidents have stayed at the Riverside landmark throughout the decades. Looking for an historic getaway this Presidents Day? This is your California stop. HAIL TO THE CHIEF: If a celebrated stay-over spot has seen a few decades, chances are that at least a few of its rooms bear either the name of a famous guest or have a story attached. That's true for many California and West Coast hotels, thanks in large part to the number of actors who called the hotels home during on-location shoots.
Sometimes it’s better to walk away, but others, it’s better to clarify misinformation. After reading (Roger) Kalter’s letter to the editor admonishing many, here is my response as a member of the Planning, Zoning and Annexation Committee. I, too, attended the same meeting which Kalter did. No one in my lifetime has ever accused me of being quiet. … It was discovered in college that I have a few auditory problems perceiving tones. But even with that slight hearing deficiency, what I heard during the meeting was far different than Kalter.
Tokyo is seeking name ideas for a new giant panda cub born at its Ueno zoo. The zoo, Japan's oldest, has not yet shown off the cub to the public. A video of the cub, born on June 12, showed the squeaky baby snuggling with its mother ShinShin. The roly-poly female cub already has the characteristic black and white giant panda pattern in its fur and its eyes have opened. ShinShin's last cub was born in 2012, but survived only six days. The newcomer appears to be thriving, and is sure to draw huge crowds once it goes on display.
For Six Months Will Result In Major Change? Coastweek -- The last year, 2017, ended horribly in terms of road users with another multiple fatality in the “national” accident black stretch – between Salgaa and Makutano, writes TETI KAMUGUNDA. This time the number was thirty seven dead (and counting) and many injured. The reason was an altercation between a lorry and a bus. Currently blamed on a mechanical fault – brake failure. There were also several other accidents and almost all were blamed on some fault or other of the vehicle. None was because of something that the driver did.
Villanova will dress only seven players tomorrow night against Georgetown in the first round of the Big East tournament at New York's Madison Square Garden. The school suspended 12 players before Saturday's 56-54 loss to No. 5 Pittsburgh after a telephone scandal involving the unauthorized use of a university access code, and none of those players will be back against the Hoyas. The suspensions range from three to eight games depending on the dollar amount each player charged. "We're going to play the same guys that are eligible for Georgetown five scholarship players and two walk-ons," Villanova coach Jay Wright said.

GOLFITO, Puntarenas – Bulldozers and backhoes, accompanied by government officials and a squad of National Police dressed in riot gear, arrived at the remote Playa Platanares beach earlier this month, much to the surprise of nearby residents. The workers were there to open an abandoned public road, according to the local municipality and the regional office of the Environment, Energy and Telecommunications Ministry (MINAET). But witnesses here in the southern Pacific’s OsaPeninsula say they were shocked by the damage to beach habitat and the secrecy surrounding the project, and have questioned the project’s legitimacy.
No Apparent Latinos In Top 25 Income Earners In Los Angeles County Government: Should There Be? Orange represents Latinos on this map of L.A.
We started a small firestorm when our piece about the Los Angeles County government's top 25 income earners noted that not one appears to have a Spanish surname -- when nearly half of taxpayers in the county are Latino. We were called racist and even told that our papers would be checked. But the debate raises a serious question: After Latinos have long demanded that UC and California State Universities should reflect California's ethnic mix, should this notion spread to local government jobs?
Allegations that scientists' views were improperly used to justify a federal moratorium on deep-water drilling are being investigated, the Interior Department's top watchdog says. House Republicans who had sought the investigation released a letter Thursday from Acting Inspector General Mary Kendall confirming the probe. Scientists who consulted with Interior Secretary Ken Salazar for a report on drilling safety this spring said the department falsely implied they had agreed to a "blanket moratorium." The scientists said the drilling moratorium went too far and warned that it may have a lasting impact on the nation's economy.
CONCORD, N.C. — A North Carolina school bus driver’s life changed with a $3 Power Play Powerball ticket. Laura Medlin of Concord bought the ticket Saturday at the Quik Trip on Concord Parkway south, according to a news release. The next morning, the school bus driver took her ticket back to the store to scan it and found out she she won — but didn’t know just how big her win was until she got to Raleigh . It was a one in 11.7 million victory. On Monday, Medlin claimed her prize at the lottery headquarters, pocketing $1,410,021 after state and federal tax withholdings.

Militants led by designated terrorist organisation, Jabhat Al Nusra, now obliquely referred to by the Western media as “Jabhat Fateh al-Sham,” has spearheaded another attempt to disrupt security operations against militants trapped in Syria’s norther city of Aleppo. Despite what is clearly a terrorist assault employing indiscriminate artillery fire provided by Grad rocket systems on an urban center and the use of suicide bombings employing vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED), Western media organisations are attempting to depict the assault as a “rebel counter-attack” meant to “break” what it is depicting as a “siege” by Syria’s own military forces.
If Goosen felt any heartache in missing an opportunity to win his second major championship, he wasn’t showing it, even though his 3-over-par 74, hardly made his final group pairing with Woods competitive. Goosen, who started the round tied for the lead with Woods at 11-under, three-putted three of the first eight holes and eventually dropped all the way to 7-under. He was never really a factor, finishing the tournament at 9-under, 3 behind Woods. Goosen insisted he wasn’t intimidated by playing in the final group with Woods or the pressure that comes with being in contention on a Masters Sunday.
Western Nevada College baseball coach D.J. Whittemore had a lot to smile about on Saturday. His team may have had its best outing of the year in an 8-5 win at Modesto (Calif.) Community College in a scrimmage. And Whittemore also received a commitment on Saturday from one of Oregon’s top pitcher for 2009. Jordan Lewis, a left-handed pitcher out of Phoenix, Ore,. outside of Medford, gave a verbal commitment to the Wildcats on Saturday. Lewis was an all-state performer last spring and was one of the top two pitchers for the Medford Mustangs, which won the American Legion state title this summer.

After investigating Daryl Washington for an alleged domestic dispute Wednesday, Phoenix police opted to arrest the Arizona Cardinals linebacker. Washington was booked on two counts of aggravated assault, according to Maricopa County court records Friday. Washington's bond was set at $4,200, according to The Associated Press, and Maricopa County Sheriff's Department said he was released from custody at 12:45 p.m. local time. The charges stem from an incident where Washington allegedly assaulted his ex-girlfriend, whom authorities said is the mother of his baby daughter.
Missing Joseph Reilly was identified after 10 years. New DNA tests have identified the man whose body washed up on a beach in County Louth 10 years ago. The tests have shown that it was the body of Joseph Reilly, who was 50 years old when he disappeared in December 2006. He was living alone at Hatch Street in Dublin city when he vanished. His family has searched for him for more than a decade ago. Six months after Reilly went missing, a man’s body washed up at Rockmarshall Beach, north of Dundalk.
Jeff Chan’s statline in his Barangay Ginebra San Miguel debut Wednesday night has failed to impress those hoping for an auspicious start to a new chapter in his PBA career but not coach Tim Cone. Cone has a different perspective. Even Allan Caidic, perhaps the finest shooter in his era, is likewise convinced Chan just suffered from a first game jitter. Though Chan played for 19 minutes, he scored only four points – all from the free throw line – as he bungled his lone three-point shot in Ginebra’s 134-107 win over the Columbian Dyip.
The number of Alaska households using food stamps was up about 24 percent in September compared to the same time last year. About 44,000 households used the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, also known as food stamps, last month, compared to about 35,600 in September 2016, according to numbers from the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services. Monica Windom, director of the division of public assistance at the department, said September had the highest number of food stamp cases she has ever seen in the state. The number of households factors out to more than 100,000 people using the program in September.

The Government was at the centre of a row last night over moves to deny soldiers full compensation for injuries suffered in battle. Solicitors for the Ministry of Defence will this week argue at the Court of Appeal that two soldiers received too much compensation after they appealed against their awards. One was left crippled and in constant pain after being shot in Iraq. The other is a Royal Marine who broke his leg on a training exercise. The Government bid has been described as a ‘disgrace’ and comes as growing numbers of soldiers are living with injuries from Iraq and Afghanistan.
It says something about the short-term prospects for Arena Pharmaceuticals. And competitors, Orexigen and VIVUS, for that matter. "Week-over-week prescriptions are increasing. We're very excited about that. And we expect those prescriptions to continue to increase as, yet a larger salesforce, goes into the field in the next few weeks." -- Arena Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ARNA) CEO Jack Lief on CNBC, June 11.

A 5.7-magnitude earthquake has hit Turkey, causing some buildings and a six-storey hotel to collapse in the east of the country. The quake is in the same region where a 7.2-magnitude earthquake last month killed more than 600 people. The epicentre was near Van province. Buildings that were already damaged in last month's quake were toppled completely and included office buildings and hotels. The quake occurred at 2123 local time (1423 EDT) at a depth of 4.8km. People are reported to have been seen running in panic through the streets and ambulances are rushing to the scene of the collapsed hotel.
Peytyn Willbourn opened Truth in Bronzeville. BRONZEVILLE — Former celebrity stylist Peytyn Willborn has come a long way from her Altgeld Gardens home. The 47-year-old, who is shooting a pilot for a new reality show and owns three “Kids R First Learning Center” day care centers, recently opened her first restaurant — Truth, an Italian eatery at 56 E. Pershing Road in Bronzeville. When asked if she's had to deal with people who doubted her, she said, “Because you know I had them, don’t you? Because I was a kid from the projects."

Growing up near St. Louis, I wrote Bill Veeck a letter in June of 1953, chastising him for trading Virgil Trucks and Bob Elliott from the Browns to the Detroit Tigers for Darrell Johnson and Lou Kretlow. But what did a kid sitting with the Knothole Gang in old Sportsman's Park know? For Veeck, the really important part of that deal wasn't Johnson, a young catcher, or Kretlow, a journeyman pitcher. The Browns were going to finish in last place with Johnson and Kretlow, or with Trucks and Elliott, but the main thing for Veeck was that they just finish.

We live in a world of unprecedented changes, increasing global competitiveness, and the very real threat of commoditization. Hence, Innovation is mandatory to continue in the game and Innovation is the best way to win. Innovation is not a separate, discrete activity but the duty of everyone in a leadership position to bring it as a total corporate strategy and as an organizational culture. This is how, authors, A. G. Lafley, CEO, P&G and Ram Charan have written in their powerful book ‘GAME CHANGER’ while talking about how Innovation is directly correlated to collective intelligence of people in an organization to increase productivity.
BALLET MASTER: What Dennis Nahat did for love (the title of his talk at the Foothill Club) would make for an amazing ballet. His sweeping mantra is that he was in the right place at the right time. But long, hard work didn’t hurt either. The future ballet master started taking dance at age 7. Seems the McAbee Insurance Company was offering free tap lessons to those who bought policies and his mother lost no time enrolling Nahat and his sister. Thus began a lifelong passion and career. “I love the sound of tap,” he says.

Celtic legend Danny McGrain will unfurl the League Championship flag on Saturday afternoon prior to the opening Premiership fixture of the season with newly-promoted Livingston as visitors. A Champions League qualifying journey to Athens to face AEK awaits in midweek – but for Brendan Rodgers the priority first and foremost will be securing all three points against a team now managed by a certain Kenny Miller. The Parkhead boss may have enjoyed unprecedented success during his two years in the East End of Glasgow – but he dismisses the suggestion that ‘Livvie’ will simply be ‘cannon fodder’ for his team.
PUEBLO, CO. (KKTV) - For Danny Bryant, circumstances were grim after being diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis last March. At just 63, Bryant began to notice something was wrong after finding small wounds and swelling on his lower body and extremities that were not healing. After being admitted to St. Mary-Corwin for treatment multiple times, his symptoms continued to worsen and he was almost unable to walk, and was forced to stop working. Bryant was told that he would eventually need to have his leg amputated due to the severity of the wounds and their inability to heal.
MessageDance Adds Video, Image and Document Sharing. Another Pownce? We reviewed MessageDance a few months back, when the site first launched its message-aggregating tools. While the service didn't seem fully able to present practical integration options for users at the time, I liked the underlying concept of MessageDance, as well as the potential for its application methods across a variety of web services. Today, MessageDance is announcing a few more new feature updates to its service that go along nicely with its recently added Twitter integration.

Boston is the best team in the Eastern Conference, but the Celtics were shut out of the All-Star starting lineups. That’s a wrong that can — and should — be righted tomorrow, when the All-Star reserves are announced on?TNT. Four C’s have absolutely made their case for a spot in the NBA’s showcase event. Here’s why they should be punching their tickets in a few weeks. There’s not much of an argument here. It was either Rajon Rondo or Chicago’s Derrick Rose at PG in the East, and Rose got more votes from the fans.
Leave it to scientists to find new uses for old products. Per the Washington Post, Twitter user Robyn Womack discovered a delightful Amazon review for a tea infuser in which a buyer explains its alternative, scientific use. "To be honest these were not being used to strain tea but in a zoology experiment involving ants," he wrote. Though a zoology PhD student herself, Womack was just looking for a tea infuser. Her wildly popular tweet inspired other scientists to share reviews of other Amazon products with unlikely uses. Some even shared shots of these products in action.
Germany has banned a Kurdish television station from broadcasting in the country because it promotes the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble said late on Tuesday. Schäuble said that Danish-based Roj TV was a PKK “mouthpiece” and also ordered the closure of a production house based in the western German city of Wuppertal that supplies the channel with programming. Roj TV broadcasts via satellite in Germany. “With its activites, the channel is an effect instrument for the continued operation of the banned PKK,” Schaeuble said in a statement.

It’s that time of year again where you put the previous year to bed and gear up for what the new one will bring. Setting new goals to be achieved, or at least projected for and while most like to set the bar higher than the year before - that’s not always possible to reach. Heck, both of those resolutions are easier than trying to go on a diet where you have to watch every little morsel that goes into your mouth, and you just might get in better shape without even having to think about it.
“Hope Heals: A True Story of Overwhelming Loss and Overcoming Love” was penned by husband and wife Jay and Katherine Wolf. The studio bought the pic for Ian Bryce Productions and Humble Picture Company. The film marks the first project under the Humble Picture Company banner. The book follows the true story of Katherine’s near-fatal stroke and how the young couple’s faith and love for one another helped them survive. With a sense of renewed purpose, the Wolfs embraced their second chance at life and started their ministry, Hope Heals, to share their story with others who are suffering.
Adam Wheeler, the Harvard student whose lies spiraled into 20 counts of larceny and fraud, pleaded not guilty today. His farcically packed resume (fluent in five languages?) and a friend's testimony portray a "super weird" extreme personality, and shifting lies. Although he told Harvard he prepped at Andover and transferred in from MIT, Adam Wheeler was actually a 2005 graduate of Caesar Rodney High School in Delaware, a public school, where he scored 1160 and 1220 on his SATs (but told Harvard he's scored a perfect 1600).
Google has bought a three-person Canadian startup, DNNresearch, based in Toronto, TechVibes reports. The "DNN" in its name stands for "deep neural networks." That's a contemporary approach to designing artificially intelligent systems which requires less work to "train" the systems. Google archrival Microsoft has already rolled out deep-neural-network technology in some of its audio- and video-indexing systems. DNNresearch is led by Geoffrey Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto who will split time between the university and Google's Toronto office and Mountain View, Calif. headquarters.
With the arrival of mid-summer, many of my tricks to amuse and entertain the four children in my house or at least stop the minions from getting on each other's nerves are utterly exhausted. It would be different if I had an inexhaustible supply of money or time but I have neither. So this is about the time in the summer where I have to dig much further into the bag of tricks, since telling them I'm not a cruise director doesn't seem to always work. This is my Mid-Summer Mom Survival Kit.
Gunn freshman Anna Zhou capped a sensational first season by tying for sixth at the CIF NCGA Girls State High School Championships on Tuesday at Poppy Hills Golf Course in Pebble Beach. The 5-foot-9 1/2 Zhou shot a 3-over par 75 on the par-72 layout that played at 6,066 yards. She was only four shots behind Sarah Cho of Torrey Pines and Cha Cha Willhoite of Palm Desert. Both shot 1-under 71, with Cho winning the state title on the second playoff hole. Two players shot even-par 72 and one, Kathleen Scavo of Justin-Siena in Napa, came in at 74.

The label founder releases a statement on the forthcoming album, remarking the big feat as fulfilling a big dream of his.
Dr. Keith Feder has some good news and bad news about Blake Griffin's fractured hand. On the plus side, the kind of break Griffin has is a simple and common injury. "It's pretty straightforward," said Feder, a surgeon at the West Coast Orthopedic Center in Manhattan Beach. "Once it's healed, it's usually not a problem going forward." The bad news is that healing can take up to six weeks. And there's not much that can be done to speed that up. "You could use a bone stimulator.
Season series: This is the first of three meetings this season between the Calgary Flames and Chicago Blackhawks, and the only one scheduled for United Center. Chicago swept all three games last season. Big story: Don’t look now, but the defending Stanley Cup champions are starting to find their game. The Blackhawks try for their fourth victory in as many games this week when the struggling Flames come to a building where they've dropped 10 in a row. Flames: Joey MacDonald's time with the Flames may be over.

Modern dads may change diapers and fill sippy cups, but you still won’t catch them using baby talk. That’s according to a new study by re­searchers at Washington State University, Spokane, who found that while mothers­ often use high-pitched tones and varied cadences to communicate with their babies and toddlers, fathers play it straight, speaking to their little ones as if they were adults. VanDam based his findings on intensive study of 11 families with toddlers about 2 years old. They’re among a larger pool of 120 families who have provided more than 2,000 days of data for analysis.
Already three cups deep into 100% pure Colombian coffee from a local supplier as I write, I’m adding to my share of the 2.25 billion cups of coffee consumed in the world everyday. Independent coffee shops equal $12 billion in annual sales in the US, according to E-Imports Espresso Business Solutions, and coffee is the world’s second most valuable traded commodity behind oil. There are approximately 24,000 local coffee shops in the US, which is almost double the amount of Starbucks locations at about 12,900 cafes, making independent coffee shops the biggest competition to the mega chain.

I’ve met many women who left corporate America to start their own businesses, usually because of the lack of family friendly work environments and fair pay and promotion. When women started their own firms, they wanted to change the workplace culture and the way business is done to support the competing responsibilities of work and family. As business owners, women want to offer good benefits, but they are often at an unfair disadvantage without a minimum standard in place. When they do decide to offer fair wages and benefits, they run the risk of being undercut by the competition.

Big Brother contestant Jade Goody's observations have kept viewers amused over the 64 days of the reality TV hit. The 21-year-old dental nurse is the youngest contestant to feature in the UK version of Big Brother. Some of what she said indicated she had experienced little of life outside her native Bermondsey, south London. Indeed, her school in nearby Rotherhithe was moved to declare she was not a typical pupil. But she kept herself at the centre what went on in the house - not least thanks to her brief liaison with fellow housemate PJ Ellis.
Explore one of the greenest places in the world, the rainforest. The warm, wet climate encourages lots of large green plants to grow. Green animals also live there - bugs, caterpillars, bees, beetles, lizards, parrots, and snakes make their homes in the rainforest. While watching the clip, the children’s attention could be drawn to the diverse range of leaf shapes and shades of green. There are a number of good points to pause the clip to focus on how the leaves are adapted to channel away excess water using drip tips or to float.
More than a quarter of young adults say buying a home is the life milestone they're shooting for the most, even over getting married, having children and retiring, according to a survey. However, sky-high rents and unprecedented student loan debt reduce the likelihood of being able to afford a down payment. Tatiana Skomski lives with her boyfriend and their dog in Portland Oregon. As far as Tatiana Skomski is concerned, the American Dream is alive and well — although just beyond reach. Skomski, 24, lives with her boyfriend, K.J., and their dog, Lola, in Portland, Oregon.
Tracy Spicer pointed out mementos from her time working for Senator Edward Kennedy in her Washington office. Spicer now works at Avenue Solutions, a lobbying firm where she is a founding partner. WASHINGTON — William J. Lynn III is the embodiment of a Washington power broker, with a hand in hundreds of billions of dollars in defense spending throughout a decades-long career. He has been a Senate staffer who recommended how Pentagon money was spent. He’s been the chief lobbyist for Waltham-based Raytheon, helping to secure many contracts, including a Navy destroyer the Pentagon didn’t want.
The Church of Scientology of Quebec says its staff are "religious workers" who volunteer their time, but a law professor says that title doesn't exist in Quebec law. A staff member of the Church of Scientology working in Quebec City in December 2017 was paid just under $70 for what appears to be nearly 39 hours of work, according to documents obtained by Radio-Canada's Enquête investigative news program from a confidential source. That's less than $2 an hour — and far less than the minimum wage, which was $11.25 per hour at the time in Quebec.
LONDON • Much has been said of Chelsea's lack of a clinical forward but manager Maurizio Sarri said that was not the main reason the Blues fell to a shock 1-0 defeat by Leicester City in the Premier League on Saturday. Instead, the Italian tactician was left scratching his head why his players did not react to Jamie Vardy's 51st-minute goal at Stamford Bridge which eventually condemned the Blues to their first home loss of the season . "I was really very happy at the end of the first half - we played very well. We were dangerous, we gave the opponents nothing," said Sarri.
The selectmen put two men back to work during Wednesday night’s Board of Selectmen meeting. The Dighton Public Library’s Board of Trustees submitted a request for the board’s approval in the hiring of Scott Haskell as a full-time custodian/page. Library director Jocelyn Tavares informed the selectmen that the position became vacant after the former page moved to a position in the circulation department. The selectmen approved the request from the Board of Trustees to hire Haskell. The board also made the decision to return Paul Pacheco’s Class II Dealer’s license for a 90-day probationary period.
In a historic judgment, the French state and the state railway company SNCF were found guilty yesterday of colluding in the deportation of Jews during the second world war and ordered to pay compensation to the family of two victims. The Green MEP Alain Lipietz and his sister, Hélène, brought the case on behalf of their father, who was transported from Toulouse to the Drancy wartime transit camp outside Paris. It is the latest embarrassment for France, which for decades refused to face up to accusations of collaboration in the Holocaust during the Nazi occupation.
Nove Innovation have secured funding from the European Commission to demonstrate a direct drive tidal turbine. A Scottish specialist in tidal energy generation has secured key European funding for technology that could revolutionise the future of the sector. Nova Innovation, which in August announced the deployment of the world’s first fully-operational, grid-connected offshore tidal array in Shetland, has attracted grant funding of almost €2.3 million (£2m) through a European Commission programme. The project is designed to produce a commercial demonstrator of Nova’s direct drive tidal turbine technology. Direct drive machines are said to offer lower operating costs, improved reliability and increased energy output.
JURGEN KLOPP has revealed his top secret mission to ruin Liverpool. Ahead of Liverpool's crunch Europa League clash with his old club Borussia Dortmund on Thursday, Klopp has opened up to the German media. In a surprise press conference held in his homeland, the Reds boss made a mockery of the Reds in his native tongue. Klopp spared few from insults, with Mamadou Sakho, Christian Benteke and Daniel Sturridge bearing the brunt. Even Andy Carroll gets some stick, before Klopp switches back to his current players with a finishing dig at Simon Mignolet.

CHESTER-LE-STREET, England, CMC — West Indies bowlers — led by their captain Carlos Brathwaite, the irrepressible Kesrick Williams and the clever Sunil Narine — defied cold, wet conditions and proved their adaptability to usher their side to a 21-run victory over England in their Twenty20 International yesterday. Brathwaite snared 3-20 from 3.3 overs, Williams took 3-35 from his allotted four overs and Narine, later named Player-of-the-Match, grabbed 2-15 from his four overs, as England were dismissed for 155 in pursuit of a victory target of 177 in the weather-affected match at the Riverside Stadium.

A million hacked Facebook accounts isn’t cool. You know what’s even less cool? Fifty million hacked Facebook accounts. A Friday morning press release from our connect-people-at-any-cost friends in Menlo Park detailed a potentially horrifying situation for the billions of people who use the social media service: Their accounts might have been hacked. Well, at least 50 million of them were "directly affected," anyway. The so-called "security update" is light on specifics, but what it does include is extremely troubling. "We did see this attack being used at a fairly large scale."
Keurig Green Mountain's next big thing is its cold-drink maker. Called the Kold, its going to be rolled out nationally next year. Right now its available on the company's website and in a few retailers. Keurig faces a saturated market for its hot drink brewing machines, which means a lot is riding on the Kold — which can deliver a carbonated, chilled beverage in 90 seconds without using a CO2 canister. That trick could give the Kold an edge over rivals like SodaStream. There's a lot of technology - and money - behind this.

To improve students’ learning, faculty must understand the limitations of memory. We take in information from our environment (stimuli), and if we decide to process or think about it further, it is done in our working memory. For example, we may use working memory to think about the new information in relation to prior knowledge and experiences. Through this process of elaboration, the new information is more likely to be encoded into our long-term memory, from which it can be retrieved later. It can be helpful to think of short-term memory as having slots, each holding a distinct idea or chunk of information.
ST. LOUIS – Mike Montgomery, whose performance since joining the Cubs’ rotation has been one of the team’s top success stories this season, said he was encouraged to hear general manager Jed Hoyer suggest the left-hander might have a chance to keep his starting role even when injured Yu Darvish returns from the disabled list. “It’s just about not getting to far ahead of myself,” said Montgomery, who publicly lobbied, unsuccessfully, during the winter for a chance to win a job in the starting five out of spring training.

The Army will use commercial technologies to develop a tactical network for voice, data and video communications. Earlier this month, the Army issued a request for proposals for the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical, a 15-year, $6.6 billion program that will replace the decades-old Tri-service Tactical Communications backbone system. The Army plans to award a two-phase contract for WIN-T to two contractors who will compete throughout the development of the program. WIN-T will provide command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities for multimedia battlefield systems. The tactical network will use three terminal devices for communication.
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has approved additional guidelines to the existing 2015 guidelines and regulations for the conduct of elections in the country. One of the new additions to the election guidelines is approved continuous accreditation and voting procedure at elections, which was experimented on during the recent re- run elections in Bayelsa and Rivers states as well as the council poll in the Federal Capital Territory. In a statement issued on Thursday, INEC said that for the time being, it has decided that the following shall constitute a supplement to the existing guidelines and regulations at elections.
The Bulgarian Weightlifting Federation (BWF) has issued a plea to former medallists to help pay a $250,000 (£179,652) fine for excessive doping. Eleven Bulgarian weightlifters failed drug tests in 2015, leading to the team being banned from the 2016 Olympics. The Bulgarian government has refused to help, saying "there is no legal basis for paying the fine" issued by the International Weightlifting Federation. The governing body could lose its licence if it fails to pay by 18 June. BWF president Nedelcho Kolev said he had asked for a deadline extension but the request was dismissed.
Every two weeks, Big Issues focuses on a newly released comic book of significance. This week, it’s Zegas, a graphic novel by Michel Fiffe (COPRA, All-New Ultimates) that pairs ambitious, unorthodox visuals with intimate character storytelling. Comics are a two-dimensional medium, but within a page’s vertical and horizontal confines is a three-dimensional space that can be manipulated by visual storytellers. Not the depth within individual images, but the space surrounding the panels, which can have multiple planes depending on how those panels are arranged.

LAKEWOOD, Ohio - Municipal Court Judge Pat Carroll has stopped using a fixed schedule to set bail because he believes it can be unfairly applied and result in the needless jailing of poor defendants. The Lakewood court’s schedule, similar to schedules used by many of the other municipal courts in Ohio, listed bail amounts for various crimes that could be applied to suspects arrested at times when the court was not in session. In a phone interview and email exchange with cleveland.com, Carroll said he changed his policy based in part on evidence he has witnessed in his own court.

In a galaxy far, far away, populated exclusively by zombie superdelegates, there's a chance that Hillary Clinton might be the Democratic nominee for president come fall. Should she beat the odds, she will need a running mate, and there's probably a rule somewhere that says she can't be married to him. Take the following quiz and decide which of 15 prominent Americans is best suited to make coffee for Bill -- I mean serve as Hillary's vice president.

MILWAUKEE (AP) - Giannis Antetokounmpo is in a perfect position to put the Bucks’ 60-win season in perspective. “Six years ago, my first year here, we won 15 gams,” said Antetokounmpo, who was a 19-year-old rookie in 2013-14. “Now, we have four times that amount. It’s big. Our goal coming into the season was to get 60 wins. You definitely have to appreciate it because it’s pretty special. “Now, we have to refocus and look forward to the playoffs,” he added.
Left: The Wild went down swinging Friday in its Game 2 beatdown in Winnipeg. Punching an opponent in the head after being so thoroughly dominated doesn’t send a message. That’s called blowing off steam. Want to send a message? Possess the puck more. Generate some shots. Complete more than two passes in a row before turning it over. Finish a check with the same thunderclap as Big Buff and his cohorts keep delivering. Put forth the most complete effort of the season to show that this won’t just be a leisurely stroll through the park for the Jets.

Invisibilia Who deserves our empathy? In this experimental show we tell the story of Jack, a young man who was part of a group called incels who espouse vile and sometimes violent views about women. We tell it in a way which allows you to empathize with Jack, and then we tell it a second time in a way which makes you hate him more thoroughly. The show examines the history of empathy in American culture, which was once considered the road to peace and progress, and in this era of political polarization has largely fallen out of fashion.
When Andrew Holness was monarchically anointed head of the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) by then Prime Minister Bruce Golding, I was one of the strong critics of such a move. It was not that I thought Holness did not have it in him to be a good leader. In fact, his stint at the ministry of education had demonstrated latent leadership and management capabilities which, if properly honed and directed, could augur well for him as a future leader of the party and government. My concern arose out of a visceral suspicion of such anointing of political leaders in a democracy.
Other recruitment groups also struck an optimistic tone on Friday. Bryant, whose group markets the 16-county Charlotte region, said he’s already heard from some people from outside the state looking for clarity on the legislation.

Meanwhile, the Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority, the city’s tourism arm, started reaching out to customers and prospective visitors Thursday to tout Charlotte as a business destination, spokeswoman Laura White said. The group estimates that direct spending only for event-related cancellations over HB2 totals $83.9 million in Charlotte.

WILMINGTON, NC (WECT) - Storms like Hurricane Florence can create plenty of stress. You may not realize your children are trying to cope with loss as you are. Maybe they’ve been in a shelter or lost a pet, and just seeing devastation surrounding them can be tough to swallow. “Kids may not have the words or ability to express what they are feeling after a natural disaster,” said Lauren Moser Vilar, a licensed clinical social worker. Allow the kids to talk about the storm as much as they want and whenever they choose.
Lessee, I read Scientific American, hardly a bastion of Newtonian physics or creationist biology. Interesting article this month positing that the discovery and spread of agriculture actually prevented a natural cooling cycle leading to a new ice age. Not sure I buy the author's argument, but it was a good read. Several months ago, there was an entertaining article on multiple universes. Advanced mathematics? Does calculus count? Formal course in logic? Yup. Granted these were all years ago (I am, after all in my late 50's), but they qualify under your criteria.
In my previous blog in this series I set the stage for a particularly bad RFP to which Source One was invited. The RFP was being administered by a third party for an unnamed company, and we were given 2 business days to turn around a response. Though these two factors made me highly suspicious, I decided to give the rest of the RFP a look to qualify it further. You shouldn’t rule out a strategic sourcing business opportunity on these bases alone. So I looked at the actual RFP content. That’s when I noticed that the RFP was riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes.
Their diet consists mostly of fish, supplemented by crabs, shrimp, insects, frogs, turtles, and other aquatic prey. On land, they capture rodents, snakes, even small birds. Although they’re iconic features of southeastern wetlands, Great Blue Herons are also found year-round throughout most of the United States in both saltwater and freshwater habitats. Florida’s Great White Heron has been variously considered a color morph or a subspecies of the Great Blue, which it closely resembles, aside from plumage color. Great Blue Herons breed together in noisy colonies, sometimes in the company of other wading birds.
CBS Inc., the new owner of WCIX-Channel 6 in Miami, has asked the Federal Communications Commission to kick Piper High School's 3,000-watt, progressive rock radio station off the air. In papers filed with the federal agency on Tuesday, CBS asked the government to reject the Sunrise school station's application for a permanent license, saying that the radio station has interfered with the television station's audio transmission. The high school station, WKPX, has been operating under a construction permit since it went on the air in February 1983. WCIX filed a protest shortly thereafter.
President Trump signed a new order Friday granting permission for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, marking the White House’s latest effort to jump-start one of the most controversial infrastructure proposals in recent U.S. history. Trump’s presidential permit gives TransCanada, the Calgary-based firm behind the project, permission to “construct, connect, operate and maintain” the pipeline in U.S. territory. The order appears aimed at addressing a ruling from a federal court judge in Montana last fall, who halted the project after finding the Trump administration had inadequately considered the environmental impact of the project before allowing it to move forward.
WWE universe converges on East Rutherford this Sunday. EAST RUTHERFORD — Get ready for bodies to twist and turn on the mat. No, this is not a weekend yoga retreat. It is WrestleMania 35 at MetLife Stadium. The ostentatious sports and entertainment event returns to the Meadowlands for the first time since 2013 on Sunday, April 7. "WrestleMania is our Super Bowl," said John Saboor, an executive vice president with World Wrestling Entertainment, the event's promoter. "It's where everything taking place in the WWE universe converges."
The NFL offseason hasn't begun in full quite yet, but between now and the start of the league year on March 13, teams will start releasing players in order to save money and get under the salary cap. The Eagles have a lot of needs, and they'll be able to fill them with some of these players. There are some intriguing potential cap casualties ranging from Redskins receiver DeSean Jackson to Giants defensive end Olivier Vernon and others. Here's a look at every team in the NFL and which potential cap casualties make some level of sense for the Eagles.
The job of Deputy Commissioner of Police has been opened up to those at junior management level. Chief inspectors, as well as more senior ranks, will be eligible for the second-in-command position if they pass a strategic command course in Britain. The role also includes giving professional advice to the Police Complaints Authority, helping to ensure the “operational and organisational efficiency” of the service and “assist in the drive and delivery of transformational leadership within the service”. The command course will be held at the UK’s College of Policing in Coventry, England, between January and March next year.
Situated in a prominent position on the corner of Hillside and Grange Road within this delightful residential enclave in the heart of Bushey is Voysey Cottage. C.F.A. Voysey, 1857 –1941 was an English architect, furniture and textile designer. Voysey's early work was as a designer of wallpapers, fabrics and furnishings in a simple Arts and Crafts style, but he is renowned as the architect of several country houses. He was one of the first people to understand and appreciate the significance of industrial design and has been considered one of the pioneers of Modern Architecture.
Traffic, noise, pollution, drunk drivers, loss of property values, increased crime. Did we mention crime? The anti-stadium group claims the L.A. Sheriff's Department is asking that Roski's stadium include a 30-prisoner jail -- you know, as though it's one of those sports-complex amenities like restrooms or hot dog stands that fans have come to expect. The gentle people of Walnut should be reminded that, by "football stadium," Industry doesn't mean it's moving in the Manchester United soccer club. A proposed new radio tower on the premises will "prevent plant growth .
Tallahassee mayor and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum spoke before the College Democrats Thursday night at the Live Oak Ballroom, promising a more progressive direction for the state of Florida. Gillum, 38, spoke for more than 20 minutes before an audience of several dozen people, outlining his differences between himself and Republican Gov. Rick Scott, particularly on climate change. “We deserve a governor who recognizes sea levels are rising and climate change is real. Don’t believe me? Go to Miami Beach on a non-rainy day and see them close the streets due to high-tide,” he said.
Joan Andrew knows that no matter what age, there's always something to do in St. Johns County. For her and the seniors involved with the Council on Aging, there's Trout Creek rec center. "If you're bored, there's no reason to be," said the 66-year-old site coordinator. Andrew took a little time to explain to us about her job - both the fun and the hard parts - and why she loves to help those who, she said, are an inspiration in her life: her peers. What do you do for the seniors at the Council on Aging at Trout Creek?

For so many years, Ikea has held the position of being the untouchable, stalwart retail giant—the world’s go-to home furnishings store with something, or many things, for everyone. Who in their life hasn’t come across a Billy or Frakta? Most years, the dependable big blue box giant doesn’t make particularly splashy headlines. But 2018 was different, filled with signs, both stark and hopeful, of larger shifts in what consumers want, and how they’d like to shop. The numbers, after all, indicate Ikea is due to reevaluate the direction of its business.
While conventional wisdom and recently published studies may hold that link building takes a long time to have a positive impact, columnist Conrad Saam begs to differ and shares four case studies. In an April 2016 article on Moz by Kristina Kledzik, “How Long Does it Take for Link Building to Impact Rankings,” the author posits that new links take about 10 weeks to have an impact. Our findings show the exact opposite: High-end link building has an immediate and persistent positive impact. I’ll explain further and share our data here.
Germany's Interior Ministry announced on Friday that it will extend migration controls at borders with Austria and Denmark, which were reintroduced in several parts of the normally passport-free Schengen area after the European migrant crisis of 2015. The extension is set to begin on November 12, one day after they were set to expire, and apply for six months. German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer based the new measure on the argument that illegal secondary migration — i.e., migrants moving on from where they entered the EU to another member state — was still too high and that border protection of the European Union's external borders was still lacking.
"I'm not sure that that's settled," he said. "Are they going to negotiate that out? But, yes the impact could be somewhat substantial." Weimer stressed that China isn't the only player in the global market, noting the European Union buys agricultural commodities. But, adding expenses to any marketplace is bound to have an effect. "It doesn't really matter which one it is, whether it's alfalfa, almonds or wherever it may go," said David Doll, a farm adviser with the Merced County UC Cooperative Extension.
The "Taken" star said on Tuesday that he is not a racist. “The View” co-hosts weighed in on whether Liam Neeson’s comments about his desire to harm a black man decades ago were damaging or productive in starting a conversation about inherent racism. Neeson appeared on “Good Morning America” Tuesday to clarify his comments in an interview with The Independent where he admitted to wanting to "unleash physical violence" against a black man after a close friend revealed she had been brutally raped. On "GMA," he said he is not a racist.
Centerbrook Architects has landed its first assignment in China: designing the interior spaces for a sprawling, one-million-square-foot prep school in Beijing. But the Essex-based firm won't step foot in the country to do it. "As much as we would love to visit China, to walk the site and to meet with the stakeholders in person, as we normally do," said Centerbrook partner Mark Simon, "our assignment in this case is to communicate and design via long distance on a fast track pace." That means using Go-To-Meeting, Skype and Newforma to share complex design files.
For a third day running, several hundred residents in South Baltimore were without power Wednesday, as Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. crews continued working to address heat-related failures to the city's power grid. Issues first began to arise in Canton, Upper Fells Point and other neighborhoods around Patterson Park on Monday afternoon, during a sweltering start to the work week, and have continued — on and off — since, residents and BGE officials have said. As of Wednesday afternoon, some residents had spent more than two dozen hours without air conditioning, as temperatures have reached into the 90s.
(L-R) Phil Lord and Chris Miller. On Tuesday night Lucasfilm announced on StarWars.com that it made a directing change for its untitled Han Solo movie, parting ways with Phil Lord and Christopher Miller due to "creative differences," though there were only a few weeks left of principal photography. The move is an unprecedented one in the history of Hollywood, as one of the landmark franchises in the business is now scrambling to complete one of its most anticipated standalone movies. The announcement also states that the movie, which is still untitled, remains slated for release in May of 2018.
How successful has Nato's strategy been in Afghanistan? Under General David Petraeus, a major plank of Nato's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) strategy has been "kill/capture raids" - lightning strikes on senior Taliban personnel to either take prisoner or kill. But have they worked? Isaf supplies no consistent data on the policy, other than issuing a string of press releases claiming success after success, releases which often describe several raids in different places simultaneously. Researchers Alex Strick van Linschoten and Felix Kuehn wanted to find out exactly how the missions worked. You can read their full report here.
Spain international Xabi Alonso is a player that epitomises the type of footballer Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez wants to have at Anfield. Since taking over from Gerrard Houllier, Benitez has preached the gospel that future success is dependent on possession and passing. Alonso is a player that can not only pick out a pass, he is also a player who will invariably find his man. So much so that against Norway in a Euro 2004 play-off he made 98 passes. Not that passing and his knack of bringing other players into the game are the only features of the Alonso repertoire - the Basque midfielder is also noted for his ball-winning ability.
President Donald Trump’s 2016 victory may have been Oprah Winfrey’s aha moment, as the talk show icon is now signaling she may be open to a presidential bid. Asked whether she may be able to break the glass ceiling to be elected president, Winfrey smiled. The show taped December 12, according to spokeswoman Rachel Nagler, but it was released Wednesday morning. “It’s clear that you don’t need government experience to be elected president of the United States, right?” Rubenstein said. A spokesperson for Winfrey’s OWN Network did not immediately return CNN’s request for comment.
KIEV, June 20 (Reuters) - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) on Wednesday said it would take part, together with two private equity firms, in an auction to buy a 41.09 per cent stake in Moldova’s largest commercial bank. Following a $1 billion banking fraud that nearly bankrupted Moldova in 2015, the government launched an overhaul of the banking sector, including the cancellation of 42 percent of shares in Moldova Agroindbank for subsequent reissue. The shares have been put up for sale several times, but have not until now found a potential buyer.
Less time for Common Core testing? Students in 11 states and the District of Columbia will spend less time next year taking tests based on the Common Core standards, a decision made in response to widespread opposition to testing requirements. DENVER – Students in 11 states and the District of Columbia will spend less time next year taking tests based on the Common Core standards, a decision made in response to widespread opposition to testing requirements. The decision to reduce testing time by about 90 minutes was made by the states and the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for Colleges and Career, or PARCC.
Domestic dividend funds are still growing. Thanks in part to significant amounts of cash repatriated back to the U.S. following the recent tax cuts, S&P 500 member firms are boosting payouts. “From the start of the year through May 18, 187 companies have either increased or initiated a dividend, the second-highest number through the first five months of the year since 2011,” reports CNBC, citing S&P Dow Jones Indices. Providing a lift for income investors and dividend funds is the fact that the rate at which companies are boosting payout is climbing as well.
As Anil Kapoor&apos;s daughter, Sonam Kapoor seemed destined to enter Bollywood. And even though her first film, 2007&apos;s Saawariya, bombed at the box-office, the star-kid tag ensured her a place amongst cinema greats. Tell this to Sonam though and the actress gets defensive, saying a parent&apos;s success can only take you so far in your career, after which, your own mettle will pave the way or bring you down in a blaze of glory. Heavy words for someone so young, but the brash 23-year-old refuses to shy away from speaking her mind.
Add these two entries to the list of time travel tomes; a slim, veritable novella by screenwriter Stanley Shapiro, and a longer, more eclectic work by Ken Grimwood. Fiction makes strange bedfellows. Or something. Shapiro, writer and producer of a flurry of popular movie classics like "Pillow Talk," "Operation Petticoat" and "Touch of Mink," briskly tells the tale of David Russell, a man obsessed with saving John F. Kennedy to prevent his brother's subsequent death in Vietnam. Obsession meets opportunity when David crosses paths with an eccentric scientist named Koopman who claims to have invented a time machine.
EVANSTON, Ill. — When you are hit with the flu, you know it immediately — fever, chills, sore throat, aching muscles, fatigue. This is your body mounting an immune response to the invading virus. But less is known about what is happening on the molecular level. Now Northwestern University scientists have discovered one of the ways the influenza virus disarms our natural defense system. The virus decreases the production of key immune system-regulating proteins in human cells that help fight the invader. The virus does this by turning on the microRNAs — little snippets of RNA — that regulate these proteins.
Bill Gates: Chinese censorship is "very limited"
Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates today told ABC's Good Morning America that Chinese censorship is "very limited" and "easy to go around." He appeared to take a veiled swipe at Google as well. Gates may be the world's greatest philanthropist, but when it comes to China, he's simply wrong. "You've got to decide: Do you want to obey the laws of the countries you're in, or not? If not, you may not end up doing business there."
BEIRUT (AP) — The Islamic State group has acknowledged for the first time that its fighters have been defeated in the Syrian town of Kobani and vowed to attack the town again. In a video released by the pro-IS Aamaq News Agency late Friday, two fighters said the airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition were the main reason why IS fighters were forced to withdraw from Kobani. One fighter vowed to defeat the main Kurdish militia in Syria, the People's Protection Units known as the YPG. On Monday, activists and Kurdish officials said the town was almost cleared of IS fighters, who once held nearly half of Kobani.
Care won’t cure the growing crisis in Ontario’s healthcare system, despite what Premier Kathleen Wynne says. In fact, the care shown by Ontario’s Liberal government over the past 15 years has progressively undermined health care to the point the system can barely cope with patient demand and is hopelessly unprepared to deal with our aging and growing population. It’s a system the Ontario Hospital Association characterizes as “on the brink,” that doctors and nurses maintain is in crisis and that increasingly fails patients who pay for and rely upon public medicare.
Unlike some of his quarterback peers, Tom Brady didn't take a stand on Colin Kaepernick remaining unsigned with the NFL season underway. In recent weeks, quarterbacks like Green Bay Packers' Aaron Rodgers and Carolina Panthers' Cam Newton have said they believe Kaepernick should be on an NFL roster. Asked on Monday by WEEI's "Kirk and Callahan" about whether he's "paid much attention" to Kaepernick's situation, Brady said he hasn't paid "much" attention. "Not much. Not much," Brady said. "Not this time of year.
Former first lady Laura Bush is advocating new territory for national parks in another natural area that is in peril: the ocean. And Bush points to perhaps the country’s most famous national park, Yellowstone, as a blueprint to expand the National Marine Sanctuary System and save the waters from ruination. Bush acknowledges tremendous strides in protecting the environment during the past several decades, except for the area that covers 70 percent of the globe’s surface, the oceans. “Less than one-half of 1 percent of the world's oceans are protected in ways that will ensure they stay wild,” she writes.
We’re on the verge of seeing dozens of new mouth-watering technologies. Drone technology is looking to disrupt local deliveries. Self-driving cars could change the way we commute. Biometric technology could make identity verification and personal security far more advanced and reliable. And of course, in a few years, our homes might be chock-full of smart devices meant to automate and simplify our lives. But along the way, consumers, lawmakers, and even business leaders are obstructing the path toward progress by highlighting the fears they have of these technologies’ inherent vulnerabilities. 1. Self-driving cars could be taken over.
It’s about fellowship and communion with Christ. Now we must distinguish between these two different things: first ‘being united with him and declared righteous as a gift’ and second ‘enjoying communion with him’. In his book, ‘Communion with the Triune God’, John Owen speaks about union and communion with Jesus. First, he says that we are united with Jesus and have received his righteousness for ever and that this is the basis of our relationship with him. Our relationship is never based on how much we’ve enjoyed his fellowship.
A 23-year-old Northwest D.C. resident was arrested late Wednesday and charged with the murder of FiscalNote executive Wendy Martinez, who was stabbed as she jogged near her Logan Circle home the night before. Metropolitan Police Department detectives identified suspect Anthony Crawford via surveillance video and witness testimony. He was arrested at the corner of 14th and Girard streets NW. Police say Crawford, who was taken to the hospital for an injury sustained on his hand, has a criminal history but no evidence suggests he knew the recently engaged Martinez or that this was an attempted robbery. A knife was recovered at the scene.
The departing “SNL” star made Joe Biden aggressive, Mitt Romney benignly out-of-touch and always maintained he was “just friends” with Andy Samberg. Sorry Saturday Night Live fans, but it’s time to say goodbye to Jason Sudeikis, who has officially announced he won’t be returning to the NBC show this fall. That means it’s time for us to remember the star’s best characters -- from the jolly (but borderline senile) Vice President Joe Biden to the inexplicably Southern-sounding judge on "Maine Justice."
"A Laboratory Simulation of a Rotary Vacuum Drum Brownstock Washer" by Hugh E. Muller Jr.
Mass balances can quantify the dilution and thickening of a liquor/fiber suspension on a brownstock washer. However, the complex displacement process necessitates an empirical approach. Given empirical data, washers can be optimized through use of efficiency factors with mass balances. Because empirical data is difficult to obtain, a laboratory washing method was developed to empirically generate displacement efficiencies on pulp under mill washer conditions. Reproducible data generated by this method resulted in a displacement/dilution function as seen on mill washers.
Punjab Food Authority (PFA) has imposed a ban on sale of carbonated and energy drinks in public and private schools. This was decided in a meeting chaired by PFA Director General Noorul Amin Mengal on Thursday at his office with all stakeholders. He said carbonated drinks and energy drinks are included in the RED list of the authority. He said it was decided by higher authorities that the sale of these drinks should be banned in all schools of the provincial capital. He said the decision will be applicable once the schools will reopen after summer holidays.
Construction is already underway on the new children's hospital. THE LABOUR PARTY is calling on the government to reverse its decision to name the new children’s hospital Phoenix Children’s Health. Leader Brendan Howlin said it was “unclear why so much was invested in an extensive process to name the National Children’s Hospital” and said naming it after someone like Dr Kathleen Lynn would be more apt. His criticisms come after the medical boards of all three children’s hospitals in Dublin expressed their displeasure at the plans to name the hospital Phoenix.
NOBLE – The Shawnee Lady Wolves kept their perfect streak alive with a 74-27 beatdown of Noble Tuesday evening. Shawnee led 15-5 at the end of the first quarter. The Lady Wolves forced nine turnovers in the first eight minutes of play. Lauren Fields and Makyra Tramble each recorded two early steals. The Lady Wolves extended their led to 21-5 at the 5:42 mark of the second quarter when Noble used its first timeout of the quarter. At halftime, Shawnee led 31-13. The Lady Wolves forced 12 turnovers in the first half. Ashley Kasterke led all scorers with 12 points through two quarters.
MOSCOW (AP) — Tightening its control over popular anonymous chat apps, the Russian government has approved regulations that would identify users by their cellphone numbers. The measures signed Tuesday by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev are part of Russia’s moves to clamp down on smartphone messenger services, such as Telegram, that authorities claim are used by criminals and terrorists. Mobile phone network operators will be required to confirm the authenticity of a user’s phone numbers within 20 minutes. If a number cannot be verified, messenger services are required to block users from their platforms.
Here are three things to know about Texas Tech basketball coach Chris Beard. Chris Beard and the Texas Tech men's basketball team has taken the college basketball scene by storm. Beard has turned the Red Raiders into one of the best defensive teams in the country. The solid play has Texas Tech playing Michigan State in the Final Four on Saturday. Beard has a 75-30 record in his three seasons at the helm in Lubbock, Texas. Here are some things to know about Beard. Bob Knight might be known for his time coaching at Indiana, but he spent the last six years of his career at Texas Tech.
The White Paper is modelled on the country's EU accord, but does it make any sense? The European Court will reign supreme. It will be the final arbiter in disputes over swathes of UK law and social practice. The Government has tried to disguised this by obfuscation. The “common rulebook” for goods and agri-foods is linguistic legerdemain. It is patently the “EU rulebook”. The full 98-page draft White Paper fleshes out how Brussels will secure British compliance on EU laws covering the environment, employment and social policy, consumer protection, state aid, and competition – indefinitely.
Attorney Michael Schneider said Friday that Guzman and his lawyers look forward to addressing the drug-trafficking and other allegations against him in court. Schneider also suggests they’re also interested in exploring whether Guzman’s extradition was appropriate. Guzman is charged with running a massive drug trafficking operation that laundered billions of dollars and oversaw murders and kidnappings. Through his court-appointed lawyers, he entered a not-guilty plea Friday in a Brooklyn federal court. He’s being held without bail. As the convicted leader of the Sinaloa cartel, Guzman has repeatedly been imprisoned and escaped in Mexico.
The market is off to its best start since 1987. That seems a double-edged sword, given what happened to the market that October. But aside from that swoon, it was a good year. However, this isn’t 1987. The massive selloff we saw begin just before Q4 in select sectors spread through the broad market. And December was particularly brutal. But now that it’s over, prices have come down to more reasonable levels, getting buyers interested in getting back into stocks, even if Q4 and Q1 earnings don’t set the world on fire.
The agency charged with building California's high-speed rail system adopted a crucial environmental document for the rail line Thursday morning, despite calls from Peninsula critics that the new document is deeply flawed and could lead to litigation. The California High-Speed Rail Authority had initially certified its program environmental impact report (EIR) for the Bay Area-to-Central Valley section of the voter-approved line in 2008. The agency was forced to de-certify and revise the document last year because of a court order prompted by a lawsuit from Menlo Park, Atherton and a coalition of nonprofit groups.
Above: A photo of Snap Inc. at the end of closing on day one of the Snap IPO March 2, 2017. Snapchat parent company Snap has acquired marketing campaign tracking company Placed, which tracks things like store visits and offline purchases. A Placed study of the habits of two million Snapchat users last August, for example, breaks down most popular stores for Snapchat users by age, gender, and ethnicity. Placed will help improve Snapchat offerings like Snap to Store, an initiative begun earlier this year to measure foot traffic and Snapchat chatter during in-store ad campaigns.
Even the most innovative consumer products can have a hard time securing funding—or even knowing where to look. Not all startups are created equal. For one, not every fledgling small business or early stage startup is a tech company. In fact, many in today’s marketplace are not tech-centered but consumer product-focused. Unfortunately, much of the common wisdom about starting and growing a startup is geared toward companies with a tech angle: apps, customer solutions, social media tools, cloud companies. Even the most innovative consumer products can have a hard time securing funding—or even knowing where to look.
Carr becomes the first Fighting Squirrel to be named a USA South Rookie of the Year in any sport. Kali Carr has accomplished quite a bit in her first semester as a Mary Baldwin College athlete. But, on Wednesday, the 2015 Robert E. Lee High School graduate earned an accolade no Fighting Squirrel has earned in any sport, as she was named the USA South Conference's women's cross country Rookie of the Year. Carr, who collected both USA South Runner and Rookie of the Week honors on Sept. 28 and Oct. 12, has had a solid freshman season for MBC.
The Tennessee prison chief wants an additional $4 million to fight the hepatitis C epidemic currently raging in the state correctional system. “This issue with hep C is not just a Tennessee issue, it’s a nationwide issue. Based on our resources that we have available, we’re committed to doing everything we can,” Parker said after the hearing. There is no guarantee Haslam will include that amount of funding when he submits his budget to the legislature next year. But the department’s request is a stark contrast to its previous stance on hepatitis C treatment.
Katy Perry’s SNL performance was upstaged by Backpack Kid. Katy Perry’s “Swish, Swish” is a fine song, but on Saturday Night Live over the weekend, it was brought to incredible life by a most unlikely source: Russell Horning, a 15-year-old boy from Lawrenceville, Georgia. Better known across the internet as “Backpack Kid,” Horning followed in the footsteps of Perry, drag queens, and other professional dancers before completely stealing the live performance. In a buzz cut, gray t-shirt, and small backpack, Horning demonstrated some elegantly lanky moves.
The World Bank's commitment to change its lending practices to the private sector has been called into question by campaigners over a proposed multimillion-dollar loan to a Honduran commercial bank. It comes months after a damning internal investigation into the bank's dealings with a palm oil company in the country. In January, the bank's internal auditor said its private sector lending arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), failed to comply with its own policies and ethical standards when it loaned millions of dollars to Dinant, a Honduran palm oil company with alleged links to assassinations and forced evictions.

United Nations: North Korea is trying to ensure its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities are safe from US military strikes, a UN report has said, as officials from both countries prepared to meet to discuss a second summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. Trump is expected to meet the North Korean leader, possibly in Vietnam, at the end of the month to discuss measures that would lead to Pyongyang giving up its nuclear weapons in return for US security guarantees and other assurances. But the report, seen by Reuters on Monday, suggested the regime was doing everything possible to protect its nuclear and missile programmes.
THE Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole, who has died aged 80, was a black nationalist who played a prominent role in Zimbabwe's struggle for independence from the white minority regime of Ian Smith. Sithole was one of the founding members of the Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu), the roots of President Mugabe's Zanu PF, and was an early advocate of armed struggle. In the years before independence, he played a leading role at many of the peace talks and negotiations held to end the war in the then Rhodesia, while Robert Mugabe remained in exile in the Mozambique bush.
NEW YORK – The cultural heritage of the entire country of Syria and the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, are among the diverse cultural heritage sites threatened by neglect, overdevelopment or social, political and economic change, a preservation group announced Tuesday. The World Monuments Fund&apos;s watch list for 2014 includes 67 sites in 41 countries and territories, from Japan to the United States. The New York-based group — dedicated to saving important landmarks from around the world — has issued its watch list every two years since the mid-1990s to call attention to sites that are threatened by neglect, vandalism, conflict or disaster.
The Tennessee Sports Writers Association continued to release its all-state teams and three Trinity Christian Academy tennis players have been named all-state. Will Richardson was named all-state in the small school division in singles play and the doubles pair of Ben Sidwell and Cam Presley also were selected. The TCA trio made history this year. Richardson reached the state semifinals after winning the Region 8 title. He also won both of his singles matches as the Lions claimed the program's first team state championship. The Sidwell-Presley team also won a state championship. They lost eight games total in the three matches they played in the state tournament.
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (WDEF)- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will be taking a soil study in the downtown and Southside of Chattanooga, after a small amount of lead contaminant was found in the city. Back in 2013, more than 80 yards were cleaned up after lead was discovered. And the EPA is now asking nearly 400 residents for permission to sample their yards, to make sure there isn’t any more hazardous amounts of lead in the ground. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wants to make sure you and your family are safe from the dangers of lead.
Three-weight world champion Vasyl Lomachenko has highlighted Luke Campbell as the toughest assignment in the lightweight division after demolishing Anthony Crolla inside four rounds in Los Angeles. If Lomachenko does not fight Mikey Garcia, promoter Bob Arum will chase a bout against Campbell in London. Lomachenko defended his WBA and WBO lightweight belts on Friday night with a brutal stoppage of Crolla 58 seconds into round four. Lomachenko (13-1, 10 KOs) saw off the mandatory challenger for his WBA belt with ease, nearly ending it late in the third round knocking the British fighter into the ropes.
Anirudh Mane’s packaging solutions start-up was still in initial stages. Along with a few friends from design school, he had managed to set up a small company that manufactured tailor-made packaging solutions for niche retail businesses. However, he was having trouble discovering prospective clients who would recognise his value addition and not see the company as a bubble-wrap and corrugated box manufacturer. Then he stumbled upon Bizongo, a B2B marketplace that helps connect solution providers like Mane with large retailers who have specific packaging needs. Bizongo also helped him improve his designs with its in-house team of design engineers.
As she reflected on the end of her decades-long career as an elected official Monday night, Councillor Maria Augimeri also had a stinging rebuke for the provincial government. “This was not the election that the people wanted,” said Augimeri of the Ford government’s move to slash city council wards from 47 to 25, which saw Augimeri forced to face off against neighbouring Councillor James Pasternak in a new mega ward, Ward 6. Pasternak received 11,559 votes, beating Augimeri by over 2,000 votes. She gave her concession speech to a packed audience at a Downsview convention centre.
In the only House race that really mattered to both parties — the special election to replace the late Democratic Rep. John Murtha in Pennsylvania’s 12th District — Republicans failed spectacularly, losing on a level playing field where, in this favorable environment, they should have run roughshod over the opposition. How exactly is it a level playing field when the Democrats have a statewide U.S. Senate primary happening at the same time? There was no comparative factor getting Republicans motivated to interrupt their busy lives to vote. That’s not soreloserdom blogging, it’s just attention to reality.
Women who have claimed sexual abuse at the hands of Harvey Weinstein say they feel betrayed in the wake of revelations that former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a chief advocate of the effort to help victims of the disgraced movie mogul, has been accused of assualting former girlfriends. "Many Weinstein victims were in touch with Eric Schneiderman. He promised he would protect them and help them get justice. Who can we trust? Nobody," Weinstein accuser Asia Argento tweeted Monday after Schneiderman resigned his office. "Unfortunately we have to get used to not trusting anyone.
On Friday’s edition of Dateline NBC, Kathleen Zellner, the new lawyer for Making A Murderer’s Steven Avery, discussed new developments in scientific testing that could help her client prove his innocence. “Generally, since 2007, there have been significant advances in forensic testing ... the clearest way to do this is with scientific testing,” Zellner said in the interview, according to NBC News. “Am I going to tell you exactly what it is? I am not. But it’s been a long time.
The same study found that men were 18% more likely to be pressed into drinking by friends than women. Nearly nine out of 10 people in Scotland have been pressured into drinking alcohol by friends, a survey suggests. The study found peer pressure was the number one influencing factor for those being encouraged to drink. A total of 83 per cent of respondents in Scotland said friends had urged them to drink, with: “Go on, just have the one” the most common method of persuasion. One in seven teetotallers who refused a drink said they had been asked if there was something wrong.
Amazon’s cashierless checkout technology is now being tested for use in larger stores, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal on Sunday. The system, which involves an array of cameras to track shoppers’ purchases alongside weight sensors on shelves, has been rolling out this year to smaller convenience stores across the U.S. in markets including Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco and soon New York. The new report says Amazon is now trying out the same technology in a larger space in Seattle, where the ceilings are higher and there are more products to choose from — things that make the system more challenging to implement.
Life is filled with moments shared over a glass of wine, whether fueling a gossip session with friends, or destressing after a long day of school. But what are the best options for the average broke college student who can’t afford a $50 bottle of wine? Each week, columnist Susana Alcantar will discuss different wine options for under $15, where to get them in Westwood and which are worth your money. No New Year’s Eve celebration is complete without flutes of bubbly wine. Many of us are familiar with sparkling wine, although we often refer to it as Champagne.
Save those seeds! Every time you prepare a squash or pumpkin, set aside the seeds for snacking. They’re easy to roast, plus squash and pumpkin seeds are full of nutritional goodness, including protein, good fats, and minerals like magnesium, potassium, manganese, and the cold fighter zinc. Preheat the oven to 275°F. Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove seeds from squash or pumpkin, rinse, and remove stringy bits and pieces of squash. Pat dry. Put seeds in a bowl, add oil and sea salt (or lite salt), and stir to coat the seeds thoroughly.
AMICUS UNION members at the giant Fujitsu Services (formerly ICL) site in West Gorton, Manchester, are continuing their fight against attacks on union recognition. They are also fighting for their pay claim. Despite a successful one-day strike on Monday 15 September, management are refusing to talk. Workers staged a half-day strike on Monday morning of this week. This included a motorcade of cars decorated with posters and balloons driving around the site. The outcome of the fight will have major repercussions. West Gorton is the only site where the union is recognised.
Porsche's engineers cut the 919 Evo's weight by dumping useless frills like the windshield wipers, lights, air conditioner, electronic race controls, and the pneumatic jack. In most motorsports, the engineer's cruelest foe isn't the rules of physics or the driver's inability to wring every crumb of power from their vehicle. It's the rules. Rules laid down by overbearing governing bodies, imposing limits on weight, dimensions, power output, tire choices, aerodynamics, braking, and whatever else they can think to control.
The past week or so I've had a hard time encouraging myself to cook for my family. I haven't been in the mood for any specific types of food and tired of all my old recipes. For inspiration, I've spent some time on Pinterest and hope that is what I need to get back in the kitchen. Here are a few Meatless Monday recipes that I am considering making tonight for dinner. The cold weather has me craving comfort food and this reminds me of a casserole my mom used to make with canned cream of mushroom soup.
EL PASO - With threats of spillover violence from Mexico's deadly drug cartel war looming, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn is proposing new border security legislation that would give local and state police access to about $300 million in federal grants. Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters Wednesday that his Southern Border Security Assistance Act would give law enforcement within 100 miles of the Mexican border a shot at millions for extra equipment, overtime and new hires. The announcement of the fast-track legislation comes just days after Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law one the nation's strictest local immigration laws.
Former Ulster Unionist leader Sir Reg Empey has claimed that Sinn Fein’s demand for an Irish language act is “less about recognition and more about trying to impose an ideology that decades of brutal terror could not”. The House of Lords peer made the remarks yesterday in the wake of an article penned by Sinn Fein MLA Declan Kearney. In the piece, which was published on EamonnMallie.com on Monday, Mr Kearney said implementation of an Irish language act “is central to parity of esteem, and proper, official acceptance of the Irish national identity in the North of Ireland”.
NEWTOWN, Conn., Nov. 20, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- An estimated $13.5 billion will be spent through 2022 on the research, development, and production of the representative programs covered in Forecast International's newly updated analysis, "The Market for Land and Sea-Based Electro-Optical Systems." Of the major EO systems covered in the report, a total of 296,036 units will be produced over the next 10 years. During the first half of the forecast period, from 2013 through 2017, some 156,561 units will be produced; the 2018-2022 timeframe should see production of 139,475 units.
For both of the past two Blue-White Games, the estimated attendance has been 71,000. That ranked Penn State No. 4 among all spring games last year. Nebraska, all hot and bothered over a brand new Frost was first, at 86,818, followed by SEC CFPers Georgia (82,184) and Alabama (74,732). I bet Penn State’s attendance is close to #77k on Saturday. That should put the Nittany Lions’ exhibition in the Top 3 of the 183 college football spring games being held this year — with 95 of them on Saturday, according to fbschedules.com.
Review: Fixes, improvements doable, but much work ahead. It was a painful Wednesday in a state long known for its world-class medical care and nation-leading health reforms. In measured, almost clinical tones, outside experts called in to review the state’s new MNsure insurance marketplace delivered a grim diagnosis of the fledgling website’s condition. Just two months before another key deadline to sign up for 2014 coverage, MNsure has deep technical design flaws, unreliable functionality and a woefully understaffed call center — problems that make it unlikely initial enrollment projections will be met.
Chicago has made great progress in cleaning up its skies. But the more we learn about air pollution, the more there is to address. A semi-tangential point I wanted to make about the previous post: progress, in terms of air pollution, can be difficult to measure. Once upon a time, as I pointed out, Chicago (and lots of major American cities) had what we’d consider now to be unimaginable levels of pollution. One piece I came across suggested that Chicago housewives buy electric clothes-dryers because the particulate pollution would soil any clothes left outside to dry.
Funding used in the hunt for Madeleine McCann will run out at the end of the month. The investigation into the disappearance of Maddie, who vanished from a holiday apartment in Portugal 11 years ago, has cost £11.6million so far. Maddie, from Leicester, was three years old when she was last seen in May 2007 on holiday with her parents in Praia da Luz, a resort in the Algarve region of Portugal. Scotland Yard launched its own investigation, Operation Grange, into her disappearance in 2011 after a Portuguese inquiry failed to make any headway.

From acclaimed filmmakers Lana Wachowski, Tom Tykwer, and Andy Wachowski comes the powerful and inspiring epic Cloud Atlas, based on the best-selling novel by David Mitchell. Drama, mystery, action and enduring love thread through a single story that unfolds in multiple timelines over the span of 500 years. Characters meet and reunite from one life to the next.

Not even a week into this year’s season and already claims have emerged that one of the couple’s are finished, thanks to one very telling post. Sorry Married At First Sight fans, it looks like love is already dead for at least one of our couples. Claims have surfaced on Twitter that single mum Ning is already back on the market, with screenshots taken of her profile on dating app Bumble last week shared online. On Wednesday night’s episode Ning “married” Mark but was scathing in her first impressions — making their possible split hardly unsurprising.
Hassan is best for N.H.
On Nov. 6, we encourage our readers to vote for Maggie Hassan for governor. On virtually every important issue our state will face in the next two years, Maggie Hassan's views mirror those of the editorial board of the Portsmouth Herald, Exeter News-Letter and Hampton Union. While Ovide Lamontagne impressed our board as a good and decent man, we respectfully disagree with him on almost every major issue that will likely reach the governor's desk. The governor in New Hampshire exerts influence through the veto and the bully pulpit. During the last legislative session, Gov.

Derrick Johnson and the Chiefs defense looked good enough against Denver to think they could be dangerous. Before the season started, we said the competitive balance in this league would be greater than ever. I think that the 13 games played on Sunday validate that statement. Three teams -- San Diego, Cleveland and Buffalo -- rallied in the fourth quarter to produce come-from-behind road victories. The Chargers scored 25 points in the fourth quarter to defeat Oakland. The Browns scored 17 to beat Cincinnati. The Bills scored 18 to beat St. Louis.
flour are daunting, and if you use sugar by the teaspoon, not the cup, buying it in bulk can be overwhelming. You can bake for two, but you may want to scale down your purchases. The standard advice is to buy larger sizes because you’re paying less per cup. However, smaller packages take up less room in your cupboard and have a faster turnover. Buy flour in two-pound bags. If you bake infrequently, store the bag in the refrigerator (this is especially important for whole-wheat flour, which can turn rancid).
IS the Philippine National Police (PNP) well-prepared to ensure the holding of free, honest and orderly elections on May 13, 2019, when the nation goes anew to the polls to elect new government officials? Yes, said veteran political observers, who expect concerned government offices, notably the Commission on Elections (Comelec), to come up with highly-effective measures aimed at addressing poll cheating. This early, the leadership of the 190,000-member PNP has already ordered its regional directors (RDs) to identify all poll watch list areas, partisan armed groups (PAGs) and guns-for-hire in their jurisdiction.
What government Minister or state body will be the 'great freeze' headline maker tomorrow morning? Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey because of his vanishing act - he was in Malta for the week - when all forms of transport were grinding to a halt in the face of our complete weather shut-down? Or maybe Met Eireann - the national weather service - after they clearly blew the forecast for this weekend. We were supposed to be digging out from 10cm! (that's 4 inches!!) of snow today, but instead it's raining. And it's going to go on raining.
BELLEVUE, Wash., Dec. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Icertis, the leading provider of enterprise contract management in the cloud, today announced the company has been named the winner of the inaugural Levvel Research Innovation Award for contract management in the ninth annual Innovation Awards. Levvel Research, the market research practice of IT consulting firm Levvel, recognized Icertis for its state-of-the-art platform as well as its rapid pace of innovation in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI) as key to the company's selection. Levvel evaluated more than 90 technology providers using product demos, customer surveys, and in-depth interviews to identify the most innovative companies.
Buddy Struckman blamed his conviction on “the Jewish jury, the Jewish judge and the Jewish lawyer," a police officer said. A Lockland man convicted of having a fully automatic Uzi-like gun and silencer at his home is considered by the FBI to be a threat to the community and has been investigated for ties to terrorism, prosecutors said. That revelation came during Buddy Struckman’s sentencing Thursday in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court. Visiting judge Guy Guckenberger sentenced him to seven years in prison. Struckman then made a reference to a Jewish religious building, Jones said.
Lamar senior guard Chastadie Barrs back-to-back games with triple-doubles helped earn her third Southland Conference Player of the Week award this season on Monday. "It is truly an honor being named SLC Player of the Week for the third time this season," Barrs said. "It is good to know that hard work really does pay off. I want to thank the Southland Conference and especially my teammates because without them I could not attain the success I have thus far." During the week, Barrs averaged 13 points, 10 rebounds, nine steals, and nine assists per game against New Orleans and Central Arkansas.
Josh Opperman put a smart new business twist on the old adage: It’s not what they do to you that counts, it’s what you do with what they do to you. In 2006, he used his savings as a market researcher to buy his fiancée an engagement ring that cost him more than $10,000. Three months later, “after a tough day at work, I came home to find that my fiancée and all her belongings were gone,” he said. But she did leave the engagement ring on a coffee table.
Behind the name of this column -- "Copy!" -- lives a story. A story that will date me faster than the photo running with it. It started back in Topeka, Kan., after I became an Eagle Scout.

"Foreign correspondent" is what I wrote down.
Hampden start… but will it be his last for Rangers? Deposed captain Barry Ferguson is poised for a starting place at Hampden in a Scottish Cup Final farewell to Rangers. Sportsmail understands Pedro Mendes has been all but ruled out of the showpiece tie against Falkirk with a thigh injury, while Maurice Edu is also a fitness doubt after picking up a knock in the SPL title clincher against Dundee United last weekend. That opens the door for Ferguson to make his first start since the Boozegate affair - and gives him the chance to complete his Ibrox career with an active part in landing the Double.
Thousands say “We’re not mascots” at Minneapolis protest | Fight Back! Minneapolis, MN - Over five thousand people joined eleven tribal nations in demanding Washington’s football franchise “change the name!” Gathering at Northrop Plaza at the University of Minnesota over 3,000 people marched and converged on the stadium two hours before the game and were joined by 2,000 others who marched from the Phillips Neighborhood of South Minneapolis. Protesters marched in front of the stadium and through the Tribal Nations Plaza. The plaza was built to honor the Minnesota tribes that helped pay for the stadium.

Harvey Kneifl said he killed his wife "out of mercy" because she had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease for four years, according to the criminal complaint. A Woodbury man accused in the molestation of multiple young children is now accused of slashing his wife's throat with a knife, killing her, and then slashing himself at the couple's apartment in the St. Therese senior living facility, according to the criminal complaint. On Friday, Washington County prosecutors charged 72-year-old Harvey Kneifl with second-degree murder in the death of his wife, 72-year-old Julie Kneifl.
TUNIS (Reuters) - Western diplomats sat down for three hours with Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar in his eastern stronghold last month to try to dissuade him from launching an offensive against the internationally recognized government in Tripoli. They urged him not to plunge the country into a civil war and told him he could become a successful civilian leader if he committed himself to pursuing a political settlement, according to two sources with knowledge of the meeting outside Benghazi. But Haftar, a military strongman who critics describe as the new Muammar Gaddafi, paid them little heed, said the sources who spoke on condition the ambassadors were not identified.
OSLO, Norway (AP) — An Iraqi-born cleric pleaded not guilty in a Norwegian court Wednesday to charges of making death threats against politicians and encouraging suicide bombings. Prosecutors said Mullah Krekar, a 55-year-old Islamist who came to Norway as a refugee in 1991, faces several years in prison if found guilty. Since his arrival, Krekar has made frequent trips to Iraq where he founded the Kurdish Ansar al-Islam, listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and other nations. It is suspected of organizing suicide bombings against coalition forces in Iraq.

Earlier this month, a story surfaced about the NFL being sent the Rice video in April to which the league commissioner Roger Goodell denies. In addition, the “Outside The Lines” report states that Ravens coach John Harbaugh asked the organization to release Rice immediately when the first footage of the running back dragging his then-fiancee off the elevator surfaced in February days after the incident. ESPN states that Harbaugh’s plea was rejected by Bisciotti, Cass and Newsome. "The ESPN.com 'Outside the Lines' article contains numerous errors, inaccuracies, false assumptions and, perhaps, misunderstandings,” the Ravens said in a statement Friday.

It’s also why the Bears’ No. 1 priority is to make Jay Cutler play safer. My favorite NFL Web site, coldhardfootballfacts.com, reports interceptions determine playoff success.

It could have been worse for Simon Fernandez. Sure, the 24-year-old Nampa resident was sentenced last Monday to four years in federal prison for illegal gun possession. Sure, his sentence was on the high end of Judge Lynn Winmill's sentencing guidelines. Sure, Hernandez had already served four years in prison for aggravated assault and discharging a firearm, and he received his new sentence on his birthday. But really: It could have been worse. At least Hernandez had three-ish years outside of the clink before Nampa police found him riding shotgun in a car with a loaded Glock pistol wrapped in a red bandana under his seat.
Gordon Ramsay may have to start taking some of the advice he gives when helping other people with their struggling businesses. According to a RadarOnline report, the celebrity chef is more than $50 million in debt. Ramsay, who helps struggling business owners on shows like "Kitchen Nightmares" and "Hotel Hell," and the umbrella company that handles his business endeavors, Kavalake Holdings, lost more than $10 million dollars in 2013. The same report reveals that Kavalake has some $7 million in cash holdings but has $50.5 million in debt due in one year.
MANSFIELD - A former Richland County Children Services employee was sentenced to 18 months of probation Monday afternoon after earlier pleading guilty to a charge of theft of computer services. Former Children Services spokesman Carl Hunnell was charged with the fifth-degree felony after using an agency-issued computer to stream entertainment videos and access personal websites unrelated to his work at the agency while at work, Richland County Prosecutor Gary Bishop said at a February hearing. "I've never felt worse about anything in my entire life," Hunnell, who pleaded guilty to the charge at the February hearing, told Richland County Common Pleas Judge James DeWeese before he was sentenced Monday.
Manny Ramirez scoffed at $25 million. He needed only one day to reject the latest offer from the Dodgers, aone-year deal in which Ramirez would become the second-highest paid player in baseball. If that’s not good enough, what is? Ramirez is a rock star in Los Angeles for powering the Dodgers to their first postseason series victory in 20years. The Dodgers couldn’t keep their shelves stocked with enough Manny wigs and skull caps. But a lot has changed since Ramirez lumbered around left field in Dodger Stadium with those dreadlocks flapping on No. 99.
Coastal markets may cool, and interest rates may increase slightly in the coming year. Priced out of expensive city centers, some buyers desire amenity-rich suburbs instead. By Susan Johnston Taylor, Contributor | Dec. 1, 2015, at 9:00 a.m.
At the close of last year, many real estate experts predicted the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in 2015. That prediction never came to be, but even if rates rise later this month or next year, Ralph McLaughlin, a housing economist at Trulia, doesn't think it will scare away many buyers.
Quick, what's the name of the DC Comics super-team made of villains who go on potentially fatal missions? Yup, it's the Suicide Squad. Only that's not what they're going to be called in the Lego Batman 3 add-on coming early next year. There, they're going by The Squad. In The Squad add-on content pack, a mysterious figure has infiltrated Belle Reve Penitentiary, and it's up to players to smash their way through the prison as Deadshot, Deathstroke, Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang and other members of The Squad to hunt down this infiltrator before Amanda Waller's—and The Squad's—secrets are uncovered.

When the Iran Hostage Crisis ended on this day, Jan. 20, in 1981, 52 Americans were freed after being subjected to “acts of barbarism,” as President Carter phrased it, for 444 days. But as for the hostages themselves, they had mixed feelings for Carter, whose policies could be blamed for getting them into the crisis, but who worked with single-minded devotion to get them out. During his last few days in office, he worked nearly around the clock on the final negotiations that secured their release, occupying the Oval Office until 15 minutes before Ronald Reagan arrived for his inauguration.
In a dramatic twist on last season’s national championship game, Jalen Hurts came off the bench to pass for one touchdown and run for another in the fourth quarter, rallying No. 1 Alabama to a 35-28 win over No. 4 Georgia for the Southeastern Conference title Saturday. Heisman Trophy favorite Tua Tagovailoa had to be helped off the field with just over 11 minutes remaining after one of his own linemen stepped on the quarterback's right ankle as he attempted to throw. Enter Hurts, who led Alabama to the national title game as a freshman but lost the starting job to Tagovailoa.
Ronny Deila blamed a rutted, ploughed Hampden pitch for his side's failure to inflict League Cup embarrassment upon Rangers. Denying they removed their feet from the pedal after the break Deila warned the SPFL the awful pitch wasn't good enough - and wrecked his team's efforts to play passing football. Asked if he urged his players to consolidate their lead at half-time the Norwegian insisted: 'I didn't say that – I said to go for three. 'But we wanted to really go and just kill the game. 'But we killed it another way – we were solid at the back and kept them away from the goal.
In a move that may impact engineering aspirants, the All Indian Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has decided to not permit new engineering colleges from the academic year 2020-21. Moreover, AICTE will only grant approval for additional seats in existing institutions based on the capacity utilisation of the institute concerned, according to Indian Express. By doing so, AICTE has accepted the recommendations of a government committee, headed by IIT-Hyderabad chairman B V R Mohan Reddy that had advised the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to stop setting up new colleges from 2020 and review the creation of new capacity every two years after that.

Allen Robinson knows his season has been a disappointment so far. Robinson has yet to earn more than 72 receiving yards in any single game in 2016. He cratered Sunday with two receptions for nine yards in a 33-16 loss to the Oakland Raiders. "I'm pretty shocked," Robinson said. "It's frustrating. I can't focus on those plays last year. I've got to make the plays this year. I can't try to make a super play every time.

Pakistan has not won a test series in Sri Lanka since 2006. The target was never going to pose a threat to Sri Lanka despite the fact that Bangladesh bowlers kept it tight. Pakistan may be defending champs, but against familiar foes Sri Lanka, there is little to choose between the sides. Ali blazed 103 off 137 balls with six fours and Misbah-ul-Haq remained unbeaten on 68 off 72 balls. The Sri Lankan batsmen appeared in no hurry to score runs on a slow turning pitch. The International Cricket Council is testing a new review system for TV umpires.
Love at first sight doesn't always work out, especially when the guy allegedly threatens to kill his spouse. Jessica Castro just got a restraining order against Ryan De Nino, the husband she met on the show "Married at First Sight," claiming he had been threatening and menacing, but the last straw was when he told her, "I plan on killing you and your family." The couple married in December, not having known each other even for a day. Producers of the A&E reality show paired them after psychological testing for compatibility.
NASHUA, N.H. — Michelle MacLeod died in a tough part of town known as the Tree Streets, where many of the streets have names like Ash, Palm, Chestnut and Walnut. Kevin Manchester, who provided the fentanyl that killed her, lived on Pine. After MacLeod's death, Nashua police wired her fiance and recorded him telling Manchester that MacLeod had overdosed and died. Manchester kept selling the powerful synthetic narcotic anyway. Manchester, 27, went to prison for selling drugs that proved lethal — a "death-resulting" charge that prosecutors are using more frequently as they battle the opioid epidemic.
A lawsuit to save the proposed lagoon development along Lake Ray Hubbard was filed by the City of Rowlett Friday after city officials said the developer has defaulted on an agreement to build $1 billion project. In the works since 2015, the development was to include the lagoon on the south side of Interstate 30 with stores, restaurants, a hotel and convention center nestled around it. Neighbors were pleased with that plan. “It became a real estate development plus. And that’s what Rowlett needed for the sign to say, ‘here we are.’ So it was much more important than just a real estate development.
MERIDIAN, Miss. (WTOK) - The bad weather held off Saturday for the 18th annual Ham Jam in Philadelphia. The festival is held downtown every year bringing in hundreds of festival goers, this year was no different. Simone Bowler attended the festival. She said the festival has a positive impact on the city's economy. "I think the festival is great for business and revenue for Philadelphia," Bowler said. "I see a lot of vendors out here and there's a lot of good products for good prices." Kaylee Griffin said she looks forward to attending the festival every year.
The stock market once again bounced back from adversity on Monday, notching small gains after Friday&apos;s brutal sell-off. Major benchmarks were up a half percent or less, but investors generally took heart from the fact that the trade tensions between China and the U.S. didn&apos;t get any worse over the weekend. They&apos;re also starting to look forward to the imminent beginning of earnings season, which will represent the first chance that most get to see the positive impact of tax reform on corporate profits.
Reply to post: Re: Legislation can save lives. Re: Legislation can save lives. @ Pen-y-gors:"Someone elsewhere in a lovely bit of whataboutery said that 10,000+ people are killed in car incidents involving drunk drivers, but no-one is calling for a ban on cars or alcohol. Actually really not a good example. In the UK we decided to leave cars and alcohol alone, but come down hard on the combination. Drink driving was explicitly banned in the UK in 1967. By 1979 (first year of statistics) there were 1640 deaths on the road where one driver was drunk.
In particular, Hillary didn't talk about her competence, her connections, her experience, her gender, and her hard work, or her qualifications to be president. Also gone were the arguments about who is the genuine successor to President Obama. She refrained from her implausible personal attacks on Sanders and his background. Instead she talked about what the country needs to do to deal with real issues of the future. Note that this is not about socialism, with free health care and free education. This is about America, the land of hard work and opportunity.
A form of chemotherapy trialled in Singapore on patients with advanced gastric cancer has shown promise in prolonging their lives. The results were presented this week at a major conference in the United States. Associate Professor Jimmy So, chief of surgical oncology at National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS), said that patients with advanced gastric cancer usually survive three to 10 months, when given conventional treatment. But of the 22 patients in the phase 2 clinical trial at NCIS, 16 survived beyond a year, with half living for more than 18 months.
Three-D printing is making the medicine rounds. Whether it's a young boy's new robot hand or an older woman's customized jaw, the technology is catching on with doctors across the globe. One of the latest projects is a new cast that looks like an attractive alternative to the bulky plaster and fiberglass casts used to treat broken bones. The new design comes from Jake Evill, a recent graduate of the School of Design at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. Dubbed "Cortex," the cast looks like a mash-up of a spider web, a piece of honeycomb and a fishnet stocking.
Valerie Goranson has twice lost her teaching assignment in Waukegan because she doesn't speak Spanish. After six years teaching 5th grade at North Elementary School, district officials moved Goranson to Clark Elementary School last year to make room for a Spanish-speaking teacher who could instruct the school's growing number of Spanish-speaking pupils, Goranson said. Now she's being involuntarily transferred again. It's the kind of deja-vu that has Goranson, and many other monolingual teachers in Waukegan School District 60, worried about their prospects for continuing to teach in a city with one of the fastest-growing Latino populations.
DAYTON, Ohio – May 23 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) — Raul Ramos y Sanchez, the author of “America Libre” (ISBN: 0-595-42606-9), a novel that contemplates a Hispanic insurrection fueled by mainstream backlash, is discovering just how volatile the immigration issue has become. Right wing bloggers in particular have taken aim at the author. “I wrote America Libre as a cautionary tale about the dangers of extremism on both sides of the immigration controversy,” said the author. “One right wing blog portrayed me as a ‘Marxican’ plotting a civil war.
Back to the nebulous tech hype that Register readers love to hate. The New York Times appears to have breached two of its own ethics guidelines when it gave op-ed space to John Battelle last week to promote the Web 2.0 buzzword. Battelle, who produced the Web 2.0 conference with MediaLive, used the space to assure us that Web 2.0 wasn't really a bubble, in a curiously nervous and defensive piece. But the Times failed to disclose that it's an investor in Battelle's new Federated Media publishing company - a very Bubble 1.0 kind of oversight.
The England women’s team successfully whitewashed India 3-0 after pipping them by a run in the third and final Twenty20 international of the series at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium here on Saturday. Chasing a moderate 120 runs for victory, the women in blue failed to cross the line after managing to make 118/6 in the allotted overs. Indian skipper and opener Smriti Mandhana top-scored for her side with a 39-ball 58, laced with eight boundaries and a six. India got off a poor start as opener Harleen Deol (1) was packed off by Anya Shrubsole in just the second over of the innings.
Gerard Baker, the British-born and BBC-trained journalist, has been confirmed as the new editor in chief at Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal. He will succeed Robert Thomson as part of a wider reshuffle at Rupert Murdoch's worldwide newspaper publishing operations. Baker will start his new job in January, capping a career that started at the BBC and included a long stint on the Financial Times in Japan and the US. He was criticised as a "neo-conservative" who is "pro-business" and "anti-Obama" by the New York Times upon his arrival at WSJ following Murdoch's acquisition of Dow Jones in 2007.
The stunning political upset by Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in last week’s primaries was nearly coupled with another seismic political upheaval in Brooklyn. Longtime Rep. Yvette Clarke narrowly avoided a shocking defeat by political newcomer Adem Bunkeddeko on the same night that Ocasio-Cortez ousted 10-term Rep. Joe Crowley. It had been more than 20 years since a congressional Democrat incumbent lost a primary in the city. Clarke, who was first elected to Congress in 2006, eked out a meager 1,075-vote win against the 30-year-old Bunkeddeko to hold on to her seat. “The blood is in the water,” one ex-staffer said.
Captain Moussa Camara consolidates grip on power after deposed government figures surrender. Camara ordered the government and senior military leaders to give themselves up by the end of Thursday. Former government ministers gathered at Souare's suburban home before boarding cars and driving off to the military camp, trailed by a number of soldiers, the AFP news agency reported. Camara paraded through the capital on Wednesday with hundreds of soldiers amid cheering crowds. He was unknown to most Guineans until this week, when he and other members of his faction announced a coup d'etat following Conte's death.
New Delhi: In India, mere 12 per cent of 355 million menstruating women use sanitary napkins. While the rest, that’s 88 per cent rely on unhygienic methods like using an unsanitised cloth, ashes, sand or even husk. While that is one end of the problem the other aspect is that the minuscule percentages of women who use sanitary pads generate a substantial amount of waste every month. To be precise, over 1 billion sanitary pads make its way into the landfills every month and continue to overburden the landfill and pose a threat to the environment as conventional sanitary napkins take 100 of years to decompose completely.
On some level, I don't really need to write a review of the Jaguar F-Type R Coupe. I mean, just look at it. Everywhere I drove, this car turned heads. People in both trendy Manhattan neighborhoods and back country villages in Connecticut loved this car. Many thought it was something Italian, like a Ferrari or a Maserati, and more than one person said something to the effect of "I've never seen a Jaguar like that before." That's the thing about the F-Type Coupe; the form is so spectacular, the function doesn't really matter.
IT WAS the night the Tinkerman became the Clinkerman – Claudio Ranieri bumping glasses with his wife on the sofa at home and drinking a toast to Craig Dawson. The champagne must remain on ice at least until Sunday when Leicester could secure their unlikely title success, appropriately enough at Old Trafford, the Theatre of Dreams. Even if they cannot secure that win, Tottenham must go to Chelsea, a team in open opposition to their London rivals lifting the crown. But Leicester’s title success has been all about fantasy, not prosaic mathematics. “Phew!” said White Hart Lane, audibly.
Why scale the tasks downward? Because in my experience, students have a hard time with [summarizing], and if they can't summarize well, they can't interpret, analyze, or just plain describe well, either. Added to that, in most workplaces (as far as I am aware), summary will be the most common writing task they will be obligated to complete. Interesting points. It could be added, I think, that good summarizing actually requires a certain level of critical thinkingor at least heightens analytical engagement. That's been my experience, anyway.
Going on sale on selected markets next month, the Qoros 3 City SUV (really a CUV) is the latest Chinese car designed specifically for the Western world, starting with the UK. Qoros is building up its lineup using a bunch of European designers and engineers, so I'm pretty curious to see how their products behave on the road. The only problem is that while the Qoros 3 sedan is on sale in neighboring Slovakia, I can't get a press car from them because at the moment, they have decided to "focus on the Chinese market".
Sutcliffe: Does a city with harsh winters need more bike lanes? There's no doubt the fact that the Laurier Avenue bike lanes have been used a million times over the last three years will become an argument for more city investment in cycling infrastructure. After all, a million is a lot, right? So therefore, the pilot project must be a success. There’s no doubt the fact that the Laurier Avenue bike lanes have been used a million times over the last three years will become an argument for more city investment in cycling infrastructure.
With physical sales continuing to decline year on year, streaming services have rapidly expanded to fill the void vacated by the CD. In return for a monthly fee (or none at all), streaming services present customers with the ability to listen to pretty much any music ever created, as much, or as little, as they like. Some services, for a limited time only, possess the exclusive rights to albums – meaning they are literally the only place you can listen to your favourite artist’s latest release. It is no surprise then, that music streaming services have become so popular.
Police in Santa Cruz, California, have released this photograph of the bank robbery. (CNN) -- A bank robber masquerading as a bike messenger has struck again. The serial bandit, who uses a two-wheeler to pedal away from his heists, held up a bank on Monday afternoon, the Santa Cruz, California, Police Department said. "He rolled in on a bike," police spokesman Zach Friend said. "We spoke to the FBI and they believe he is associated with other robberies in the San Francisco area."
Property or block management is the process of managing the communal areas of residential leasehold properties through the service charge. Block management involves communication with various parties in respect of maintenance and repairs, insurance of the building, Fire Risk Assessments, the provision of services such as central heating, lifts, porterage, estate staff, lighting and cleaning of common areas. It also requires a good understanding of legislation and leasehold matters, preparation of budgets and annual accounts, as well as routine inspections to check that the property is in good order. Leasehold flats can be in purpose-built blocks, in converted houses or above commercial or retail premises.
As a gardener and mother of sons, this is a moment I’ve been waiting for. A few days ago, my oldest son Jacques, aged 36, turned to a mate at work – they’re woodworkers – and said: “I think gardening is the new drum and bass.” Most small children love messing about in gardens, but during their teenage years, apart from a saintly few, they become interested in other things and rediscover those gardening genes only once they have green spaces of their own. Perhaps gardening really is on trend among the younger generation.
Morrison’s responsibilities were more related to the business side of the organization rather than football operations. His resignation caught Panthers officials – and people outside the organization – by surprise. Morrison said he’s been thinking about stepping down for a while. With the league year beginning next month, he thought the timing was good to move on. But Morrison declined to discuss his future plan in a phone interview Thursday evening. If Morrison’s interested in an AD job at the college level, UNLV and Arizona both have openings.
ENGLAND need to bring back the spirit of Euro ’96 to come out on top in Poland and Ukraine this summer. That is the view of former skipper Paul Ince, who helped the Three Lions reach the semi-finals on home soil that year. Terry Venables was in charge, Paul Gascoigne scored one of the goals of the tournament against Scotland, and Holland were thrashed 4-1. Gareth Southgate’s penalty miss in a semi-final shoot-out against the Germans ended up costing England a place in the final. But it was their best showing in European Championship history and Ince claims the team spirit has never been higher.
On paper, it's a wonder the Raiders and New York Giants are even going through the trouble of playing. One would be hard-pressed to find a more mismatched game statistically than this one. Not just because the Giants are 4-0 and the Raiders are 1-3. The Giants defense is No. 1 in yards per game allowed (232.2 average) and passing yards allowed (115). The Raiders' offense is last in yards gained (208.5) and passing yards (119.8). Things aren't much closer in reverse. The Giants are fifth in scoring (26.8), the Raiders 31st (10.5).
More than 900 bills were filed Friday, as lawmakers scrambled to get their final pieces of legislation submitted before the 6 p.m. filing deadline. In total, over 6,300 bills were filed this legislative session, roughly 300 more than in 2013's session. Approximately 350 of the filed bills are related to higher education. Rep. Zerwas (R-Richmond) , chair of the House Higher Education Committee, said in interview with the Texan last week it is normal for there to be an influx in the number of bills filed as the deadline approaches. Below are some of the 928 bills filed Friday.
Can Jordan Spieth answer Rory McIlroy at Colonial? Adam Scott: The defending champ has fallen out of the top 10 in the Official World Golf Ranking, but he still makes our list of the game's top-10 ball-strikers. Scott led the field in proximity to the hole by more than six feet during his win last year. Whether he's converting birdie putts or not, that sort of iron play should provide plenty of points. Zach Johnson: No one has played Colonial better in recent years than ZJ, who had a remarkable four-year run from 2010-2013 in which he won twice and added a third and a fourth.
Anarchists in Britain “don’t want rich tourists,” they want “civil war.” As the London Olympics draw nearer, those flying the black flag are going for gold in sabotage. In line with their ideological convictions, the Games set for July are viewed as a rightful cause to act. “We have no inhibition to use guerrilla activity to hurt the national image and paralyze the economy however we can. Because simply, we don’t want rich tourists – we want civil war,” reads a statement on their website.
Palatine senior Abby Amato ended last season on a high note, qualifying to the girls gymnastics state meet in the all-around, uneven bars, beam and floor exercise. And this season, the Pirates senior seems to have picked up where she left off. Amato sure looked comfortable on Wednesday in taking first in the all-around (36.10) and powering host Palatine to an impressive 140.20-128.05 Mid-Suburban League West victory over visiting Barrington. Amato won the bars (9.05), added second-place finishes on the beam (8.7) and floor (9.25) and also tied for second on the vault (9.1).
It’s July in Cape Town, which means that it’s the dead of winter: Thick sheets of fog unfurl down Table Mountain, bringing with them steady torrents of rain. And yet somehow the skies seem less gray in Bo-Kaap, where clusters of rowhouses snaking up the slopes of Signal Hill explode in a rainbow of gold, lavender and periwinkle. Also known as the Cape Malay Quarter, the Bo-Kaap neighborhood is home to Cape Town’s Muslim community. And the food being cooked in the kitchens of these houses is no less colorful than the facades.
The boutique known for its contemporary classic style will close in December, leaving a void in the once-thriving shopping center in Roland Park. Jones & Jones is selling everything in its store for 50 percent off as it plans to close this month. Jones & Jones has marked down its entire store by 50 percent. The deep discounts are part of the Cross Keys boutique’s going-out-of-business sale. The store will close at the end of the month. I recently went by the boutique, and there were plenty of on season finds that would be perfect additions to your closet or would make perfect holiday gifts.
Some Israelis may be rethinking whether settlements are worth the trouble. In recent weeks, the relationship between Israel and the US has grown tense as the White House continues to demand a freeze on illegal settlement growth in the West Bank despite adamant refusal from Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, to do so. For Israelis the row was embarrassing, but hardly a surprise. To a people already sharply divided over settlements and their place in the peace process, the feud was seen to mirror Israeli society's inner conflicts. Noga Martin, a former Israeli journalist, says that she hopes to see Palestinians form an independent state.
Police arrested two teenage brothers who they say played a role in the fatal gang-related stabbing of a 19-year-old in Silver Spring, Maryland, last month. WASHINGTON — Police arrested two teenage brothers who they say played a role in the fatal gang-related stabbing of a 19-year-old in Silver Spring, Maryland, whose body was found last month. Police arrested brothers Lenin Mancias-Callejas and Bryan Mancias-Callejas, both 16, for their role in the stabbing death of Herson Mejia-Alvarez, 19. An arrest warrant has been issued for a third suspect, 18-year-old Francisco Sosa. The three teens are members of a gang, police said.
Profits from Amazon's cloud division jumped 69 percent last quarter, but the rest of its business fared less well. Amazon Web Services generated an operating profit of $687 million in the three months to Dec. 31, on sales of $2.4 billion, Amazon said Thursday. That was up from $240 million in profit and sales of $1.4 billion the year before. Amazon started breaking out its cloud numbers last year and it's proved to be the most profitable part of its business. Operating margins were 29 percent last quarter, compared to 3 percent for the company as a whole.
Mayo officials are keeping a close eye on public subsidies for other medical centers. As the Mayo Clinic preps for a two-decade, $5 billion expansion — Rochester voters have already approved a half-cent sales-tax increase for the clinic and the Legislature is being asked for bonding authority for $37 million to upgrade the civic center and $500 million for new roads – Elizabeth Baier of the Rochester Post-Bulletin says Mayo officials are keeping a close eye on similar developments at other medical centers. One of these is the Cleveland Clinic, where the $465 million Cleveland Medical Mart will open in July.
(Newser) – A national poll showed Donald Trump slightly ahead of Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, though, as Nate Silver points out at FiveThirtyEight, cherry-picking polls isn't necessarily indicative of an overall trend: Per the FiveThirtyEight model that analyzed a whole slew of surveys, Clinton appears to still be in the lead by about 3 or 4 percentage points nationwide—a slicing in half of the lead she enjoyed in mid-October. But it's the Electoral College numbers that have Silver declaring Trump as "no longer really a long shot," though he remains the "underdog."
Etta's hopeless husband Chester, wannabe entrepreneur and liquor store owner, blows every nickel he makes trying to get rich on hare-brained inventions. After their young boys, Shane and Chris sneak off to try smoking and blow up the backyard shed full of Chester's homemade fireworks, Etta realizes she must take matters into her own hands to fulfill her dream of sending the boys to college one day. Inspired by the success stories on ,"The Antiques Roadshow," Etta formulates the perfect investment strategy. She'll invest in antiques and sell them off later to bankroll the kids' college fund.
It looks like the iPhone 4S won’t be just launching in 15 new countries on November 11th as regional carrier C Spire has announced that it will start offering the iPhone 4S on the same day as well. The price of the device won’t change when it lands either. C Spire will be offering up the phone at Apple’s suggested prices of $199 for a 16GB model, $299 for 32GB, and $399 for 64GB. C Spire, formally known as Cellular South, is currently the 8th largest service provider in the United States and is the country’s largest private carrier.
I have 2 speakers (JBL Flip 3), and 1 of them is connected to my TV (which does not have Bluetooth), via a digital to analog converter and cables. Can I pair a second speaker without hooking it up to my tv, but instead pairing it with my other speaker via Bluetooth? The Flip 3 speakers support the JBL Connect app so you should be able to pair them both to the same transmitter and may be able to set one as left and the other as right in the app. I don't know if one speaker that is wired will work with another in bluetooth though.
How significant is the saber-rattling between India and Pakistan ? *A CYBER TRADITION? The story on when Ramadan ends and the festival of Eid al-Fitr begins was a personal one for reporter Farhan Bokhari. This is the first year he hasn't climbed the roof of his Islamabad home or taken his young children out to the front yard to look for the new moon. "There's a lot of excitement, anticipating the start of Eid. We usually look for ourselves, but if it's cloudy, we watch for it on the telly," says Farhan.
It is difficult to imagine it now but rural parts of Ireland underwent a technological revolution when electricity was finally delivered to people’s front doors in the 1950s. We can get an impression by watching the grainy, scratchy-sounding news reels showing people plugging in a kettle or a heater or switching on a light rather than an oil lamp or candle. Scepticism gave way to ready acceptance for the most part, opening a path for what would follow – several generations worth of research and innovation that delivered products and services that would have been impossible to imagine for those suddenly able to throw a switch to get warm.
WASHINGTON - WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal regulators voted Wednesday to require companies to reveal more information about how they pay their executives amid a public outcry over compensation. The Securities and Exchange Commission voted 4-to-1 to expand the disclosure requirements for public companies. Company policies that encouraged excessive risk-taking and rewarded executives for delivering short-term profits were blamed for fueling the financial crisis. The SEC also changed a formula that critics say allowed companies to understate how much their senior executives are paid. At issue is how public companies report stock options and stock awards in regulatory filings.
Former Seahawks wide receiver Golden Tate, who signed as a free agent with the Detroit Lions this offseason after calling Seattle’s offer “laughable,” had an explanation for the Hawks’ offensive troubles this season. In his fourth season with Seattle, Tate led the Seahawks last year with 64 catches for 898 yards and five touchdowns en route to their victory in Super Bowl XLVIII. He was a key piece of the NFL’s second-most efficient passing offense in 2013, when he helped Seattle average 8.4 yards per pass attempt as quarterback Russell Wilson’s go-to receiver.
After much anticipation, Melania Trump has finally given the world a glimpse of her platform. Like those before her, Trump is keen to make a difference in her own unique way. Speaking in the Rose Garden, she officially launched "Be Best," which tackles three key pillars: well-being, social media and opioid abuse. But what does it take to be effective as first lady, especially amid an ever moving spectrum of expectations, responsibility and public opinion? The first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, recently stated that most first ladies have focused on a single issue.
At one point in the not so distant past, NBC’s hit reality competition The Biggest Loser was viewed largely as an empowering series that really helped the annual batch of contestants lose weight and gain control of their health. But despite the inevitable emotional moments that warm hearts, the show has been a target for all manner of negative press in the past couple of years, and now it’s gone from former contestants slamming the producers for inhumane treatment to something far more official. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department is currently investigating the show for on-set drug use.

Zoologists study the interactions and patterns of animals. 2 How Much Do Mammalogists Get Paid? Animal lovers can make nearly six figures with a Ph.D. in zoology, and spend their time studying animal behavior and coming up with ways to preserve the wildlife they love. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, zoologists work everywhere from government agencies to research facilities to wildlife centers. The median annual salary of zoologists as of May, 2010 was estimated at $57,430 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A zoologist needs a bachelor's degree with a master's degree preferred.

The need for better communication among emergency responders was one of the critical requirements identified in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks, and has been reaffirmed in nearly every disaster response since. The nation's 50,000 federal, state and local law enforcement, fire department and emergency medical agencies have built separate communications systems over the past century, with little if any thought given to interoperability. The challenge of tying these legacy stovepipes into common communications channels has proved daunting, but some areas of progress are beginning to emerge. Two programs in different parts of the country are taking different approaches in their quest for interoperability.
The new courses, meant to expand scope, bring to 10 the number of courses at the vocational institute. Nakawa Vocational Training Institute has introduced two new courses. This brings to 10 the number of courses offered at this institution. The school principal, Mr Musoke Matovu, said the new courses; Information Communication Technology and Mechatronics (a combination of mechanical and electrical engineering), would start next academic year. Mr Matovu said there were plans to include Training for Vocational Education Teaching as part of the new courses and expand the Instructor Training provision from four to eight.
Amid all the headline-making events of the past year, it’s easy to forget that the big occurrences in people’s lives tend to be the ones that happen close to home. A study by the MetLife Mature Market Institute offers a reminder of this. One section of its poll of 45-74-year-olds (fielded last summer and fall) looked at some of the “trigger events” that significantly affect a person’s life. Twenty-one percent of respondents said they’d experienced the death of someone close to them during the year before being polled.
As a teenager, Mary Sanford Williams yearned to become a lawyer. But at the time, there was no money for college. Finally, now that she has graduated from Baltimore City Community College - at age 80 - the West Baltimore resident is closer to her goal. BCCC's oldest graduate this year plans to become a legal assistant. According to The Sun's Sumathi Reddy, Ms. Williams, who had a 3.5 grade-point average, did not attend the graduation ceremony last week because she is in summer school and has started course work at the University of Baltimore on the way to getting her bachelor's degree.
By Mark N. Katz, Special to The Christian Science Monitor The writer is a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C., specializing in Soviet policy in the Arabian Peninsula. Despite speculation to the contrary, Saudi Arabia does not intend to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, according to several high-level Saudi officials. In Washington, the Saudi ambassador's dinner invitation to Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin last month did not signal improved ties between the two countries, these officials say. Prince Bandar bin Sultan's invitation was merely a courtesy to Mr. Dobrynin, who is the dean of Washington's diplomatic corps.
Speaking in Parliament on Monday, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said that the fraudulent claims "should not have been allowed to happen". An inter-agency task force has been set up to conduct a “thorough review” of SkillsFuture claims, after a series of offences that involved S$40 million worth of fraudulent claims being paid out by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG). SINGAPORE: An inter-agency task force has been set up to conduct a “thorough review” of SkillsFuture claims, after a series of offences that involved S$40 million worth of fraudulent claims being paid out by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG).
I’ve been glued to my Kindle all day, reading Charles Kenny’s compelling and important new book, The Success of Development: Innovation, Ideas and the Global Standard of Living. Kenny is a great writer, and his book is a true pleasure to read; it’s also a crucial addition to a development literature which has gotten bogged down in debates which will never be satisfactorily resolved. The Success of Development acts like a sword through many of the Gordian knots plaguing the development community, especially those surrounding the rate of economic growth in many developing countries.
The experience of getting married, but with zero commitment. Falsa Boda is an Argentine event company that puts on fake weddings. The company was created by a group of friends who realized that the aversion to marriage among twenty- and thirtysomethings meant a large number of young people had never attended a wedding. So they decided to start putting on events that mimic actual wedding ceremonies. Guests select the venue which they wish to attend, then follow guidelines such as meeting points and dress codes. The parties are all about the key wedding details: A bridal couple who re-enact marriage vows in front of the guests.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer people signed contracts to buy homes in July, the fourth decline in the past five months. The decrease likely reflects the worsening shortage nationwide of homes being listed for sale. The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that its pending home sales index fell 0.8 percent in July to 109.1. The index has slipped 1.3 percent over the past 12 months. The decline suggests that home-buying has begun to stall because fewer homes are on the market. The dwindling number of properties for sale is causing prices to rise faster than wages, hurting affordability.

This is Accelerator Suit Duke, and he's been deemed the "most advanced action figure of all time." Watch him run, watch him shoot, watch him ruin your childhood's conception of everything that is good. Jack pretty much nailed it after the trailer premiere during the Super Bowl: "it doesn't really feel like G.I. Joe, you know?" Accelerator Suit Duke is about as extreme in that direction as you can imagine, but I must admit, that running-man action is pretty sweet. He's $70. G.I.
7.6 million vinyl albums were sold in the first half of 2018. And no artist has sold more copies of a single album this year than Jack White. If the resurgence of vinyl is a fad, it's the kind that has lasted for longer than a decade — and shows no sign of slowing down. According to Nielsen Music, vinyl album sales were up 19.2 percent in the first six months of 2018 compared with the first six months of 2017. From Dec. 29 through June 28, 7.6 million vinyl albums were sold, Billboard reports.
Ruslan Kogan, founder of the Kogan online electronics retail business has used the announcement of record quarterly growth as an opportunity to bash his more traditional rivals. With revenue growth of 48% in the first quarter of financial 2011 (though there was no indication of how profitable the company was), Mr Kogan can perhaps be forgiven for carping about the way LG Electronics recorded an operating loss of $US164 million, and Harvey Norman chalked up a 0.6% decline in sales (on a like-for-like basis) with a 30.8% drop in profit.
Using a phone, be it smart or otherwise, while driving is incredibly dangerous. You could seriously injure someone including yourself, face a conviction, and have to spend a fortune paying out for repairs and compensation. We all know this, but thousands of us still choose to combine the two activities. Maybe the promise of free coffee can change that? In Japan, Toyota is trying an experiment for Autumn Traffic Safety Week where drivers are rewarded for not using their phone while driving. The car manufacturer has teamed up with telecomms company KDDI and coffee shop chain Komeda to offer free coffee in return for good driving habits.
A malady that affects most everybody but receives very little attention is what I call the self diagnosis anxiety syndrome, or SDAS. Symptoms of the self diagnosis anxiety syndrome are numerous. You are anxious and nervous. A great deal of time is spent just thinking about the disease you diagnosed. So much so, it may interfere with your daily existence. A malady that affects most everybody but receives very little attention is what I call the self diagnosis anxiety syndrome, or SDAS. An example of SDAS is when you diagnose the headache that you have as a brain tumor.
Standard bricks still made of oil-based plastic; company has 2030 goal for those. Enlarge / All of these Lego pieces will now be made of sugarcane-derived polyethylene. Starting this year, buyers of new Lego playsets will begin to see a new type of block in their boxes—ones made of plant-based plastic. The Danish company announced the initiative on Thursday, confirming that roughly "1-2 percent" of all Lego bricks are now being made of sugarcane-sourced polyethylene. For this material-switch rollout, Lego has made the admittedly cute decision of using it to produce playsets' tiny Lego plants—as in, trees, shrubs, vines, and patches of grass.

It’s a slow, didactic film about a minor episode. Billed as being based on “a crazy, outrageous incredible true story” about how a black cop infiltrated the KKK, Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman would be more accurately described as the story of how a black cop in 1970s Colorado Springs spoke to the Klan on the phone. He pretended to be a white supremacist . . . on the phone. That isn’t infiltration, that’s prank-calling. A poster for the movie shows a black guy wearing a Klan hood.
Beauty Banter – How To Get Glowing With Highlighter! I love the radiant, fresh-faced glow models have on the runway. I know highlighter can achieve this, but it seems difficult to use. Where should highlighter be applied, and what other products should be used with it? I need some make up advice! 1. The corner of the eyes by the bridge of the nose. This draws the light to the corner and takes away attention from the crow’s feet so you’ll automatically look younger. It can also brighten up the entire face. 2.
All this kid wanted to do was draw a nice picture of Buzz Lightyear with Buzz’s catchphrase ‘I come in peace’ alongside. He ended up with this. To be fair to the ‘artist’ it is not beyond the realms of possibility that an intergalactic space ranger like Buzz Lightyear should like pies. Pies are great after all. However, no one – not even Buzz – should like pies this much. And that is why this felt tip speech bubble, juxtaposed with the familiar image of one of the world’s favourite cartoon heroes, comes as such a shock.
Recent "hacks" against Pentagon, Senate and FBI World Wide Web sites have highlighted the importance of protecting computer systems against cyberattacks. Indeed, the digital equivalent of spraying graffiti on agency home pages (and denying citizens access to those sites) is the least of the problems. Critical infrastructures central to our economy and government - including telecommunications, transportation, and banking and finance - depend on networked information systems that are vulnerable to attack. While there is no doubt that the problem of critical infrastructure protection is real, there is cause for concern that the hype surrounding the issue may lead to infringements on civil liberties.
The FBI in New York plans to send agents to Uganda to help investigate the deadly bombing that reportedly was carried out by a group aligned with al Qaeda, news sources reported. “The New York Joint Terrorism Task Force is in the process of deploying a team of agents and forensic experts to assist Ugandan authorities in their investigation,” FBI spokesman James Margolin told Bloomberg. The bomb killed at least 74 people. AOL News reported that the radical Islamist movement al-Shabab claimed responsibility, saying the attacks were revenge for Ugandan soldiers being in the Somali capital. It reported that the group is aligned al Qaeda.
Curtis Stone, chef at Maude in Beverly Hills, has just opened his second restaurant. But it's not the Beverly Hills project he's been working on with Chi Spacca alum Chad Colby. It's called Share and it's on board two Princess Cruises ships. The Australian chef didn't agree to go from his tiny, hyper-seasonal L.A. restaurant to cruise ship partner right away. "How could I do a restaurant on a ship?" asked Stone. "It doesn't make sense at all. But hearing more about their ability to change things around, it started to become more interesting.
K.L. in Butler County: I’ve never been someone who’s been super involved with our financial and investment decisions, but as I get older, I realize that I need to understand what’s going on with our money. But every time I try and ask my husband to include me, he basically brushes me off. How can I get him to take me seriously? Answer: First off, good for you. We adamantly believe that, within a couple, both people need to be on the same page about the household finances.
BREAKING … PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP will hold a news conference WEDNESDAY at 5 p.m. “to discuss the #UNGA trip and news of the day.” This presser comes the night before he meets with DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN and the BRETT KAVANAUGH hearing. ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM -- “Cramer questions whether Kavanaugh assault allegation is disqualifying,” by James Arkin: “Rep. Kevin Cramer, the Republican nominee for Senate in North Dakota, questioned whether the allegation of sexual assault against Judge Brett Kavanaugh would be disqualifying for his Supreme Court nomination even if it were true.
Marco Rubio has decided he isn't quite up to life in the private sector and is running for re-election. As his decision was ostensibly made in the aftermath of Orlando, he's trying to position himself as a national security hawk and is going after Hillary Clinton. A high-powered group of senators officially petitioned the State Department Thursday to suspend the security clearances of former Secretary Hillary Clintonand her top aides — a move that could effectively kneecap her preparations for the White House. They took that step after the White House said it wouldn’t act on its own.
The "homosexual sitcom" has become something of a subgenre in the last decade-and-a-half. With shows like Will and Grace, The New Normal, Glee, and Modern Family normalizing depictions of homosexuality on television, the furor over Ellen Degeneres coming out of the closet seems ever further away. British television has embraced this new paradigm with a totality that perhaps goes beyond American programming. Nonetheless, there are always new frontiers to explore. In an interesting move, British network ITV has begun production on Vicious, a sitcom revolving around a bitter homosexual couple slouching their way into their golden years.

Banksy is one of contemporary Britain's most successful artists -- and its most mysterious. He is primarily a graffiti artist, and his distinctively stenciled artworks have appeared on streets, walls, and bridges around the world. And one of his works has sold at auction for about $145,000. But his identity remains a closely guarded secret. Now, an academic study claims to have unmasked him. Sort of. Maybe. The study used geographic profiling of the kind used in criminal cases or in tracking the source of an outbreak of disease.
The boldest choice the production — directed by Rayna Smith and produced by Christina Lee — makes is in its casting: Antony is portrayed by a female, Kaya McRuer (‘17). This choice speaks to gender inequity in Shakespearean plays and allows for a more feminized power dynamic between McRuer and Cleopatra (Melanie Arnold ‘16). McRuer acts with a great deal of masculine energy – in her heavy, forceful gait, her clenched jaw and her ferocious glare – and the juxtaposition between her gender identity and the language of the traditionally male Antony is fascinating.
Taxi booking firm Uber has completed the latest stage of a fundraising, valuing the fast growing business at $40bn (£25.5bn). The San Francisco company has raised another $1.2bn from investors in a deal that confirms its status as one of most highly valued new technology start-ups. In June, a sale of shares to investors valued Uber at $17bn. In a blog post on Thursday, Uber's co-founder Travis Kalanick said the new money would help expansion in Asia. The company, which a year ago operated in 60 cities in 21 countries, is now in 250 cities in 50 countries.
Law c’tee chairman: Letter is "interference"; Labor MK Bar: MKs should see critiques as a warning against supporting bill. Knesset legal adviser Eyal Yinon, in a strongly worded letter Tuesday, fiercely criticized the electoral reform proposal that Knesset Law Committee chairman David Rotem (Likud Beytenu) is expected to pass in a preliminary reading in the Knesset on Wednesday. Rotem’s bill would increase the electoral threshold to four percent, limit the number of ministers including the prime minister to 19 and extend the amount of time a new government has to pass a budget from 45 to 100 days.

Last year Boston University emitted 146,000 metric tonnes of CO2 from fossil fuels burned on campus to heat and cool our buildings, and from the fossil fuels burned by others to generate the necessary electricity and steam. With the impacts of climate change becoming more apparent every day, colleges and universities around the world are implementing climate actions plans – road maps to reduce their carbon footprints. It is essential to benchmark current greenhouse gas emissions in order to plan for and manage energy consumption, and to make cleaner fuel choices. The first step in developing a climate action plan is to establish a greenhouse gas inventory.
Billboard hopped on the phone with TDE’s lone wolf during his run through Austin, TX for SXSW to discuss the EP, his infatuation with wolves and why there is no TDE presence on his debut project. Underrated at the time of its release, 'Hard to Earn' ended up being the album that truly defined the sound of Gang Starr. The Los Angeles production duo of Money Mike and J-Keys have been here before. But this time at the Grammys certainly feels different. Future's recently released seventh studio album has plenty for fans to love. We pick our 10 favorite tracks.
This led us to look for a new way, a change from this past, and new hope. Trump came along and now, he is our president. So today, let each of us turn the page to a new chapter. Instead of fighting what we don’t like, why don’t we use whatever we do have and make it better by doing the best we can with it? Instead of finding fault blaming someone or something, why don’t we just find better ways of doing things at work, at home, and with our friends?
Shares of newspaper publishers slipped Tuesday, after a Citigroup analyst said newspapers will probably continue to see declining operating profits for about five years, until online platforms overcome print-related losses. Late Monday, Citigroup issued a research report showing newspapers are facing a reduction in information flow control because of the Internet. In addition, Web options are grabbing classified advertising market share. Analyst William Bird said the industry is also dealing with an aging readership base, as older readers who are most likely to subscribe are replaced by younger consumers accustomed to online access to news.
OKLAHOMA CITY - Robert Neal is picking up the pieces of what is left of his home after a three-alarm fire. It happened in the 1600 block of N.W. 32nd St. near 30th St. and Penn. Ave. It started in Neal's detached garage but soon spread to the back of his house and another neighbor's garage. "We went outside and the whole garage was completely engulfed," he said. Neighbors first noticed the smoke and the flames and jumped into action; without their quick thinking and helping hands, it could have been much worse.
Amidst all the recent 2020 presidential announcements, America Ferrera says she’s putting her money on some of this year’s newest politicians. The “How to Train Your Dragon” star was one of several cast members braving the rain at Saturday’s carpet in celebration of the franchises’ third and final installation. Directed once again by writer and executive producer Dean DeBlois, “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World” follows viking clan leader Hiccup as he tries to discover a hidden dragon utopia before the evil dragon hunter Grimmel finds him first.
The group stepped off at 11:30 a.m. and spent about an hour and a half walking the trails. Members found enough garbage to fill a portion of a garbage bag and a 5-gallon bucket they found on the mountain. Most of the refuse picked up was empty cans, bottles and paper. Besides the grill, which appeared to have been hit with a shotgun, other unique items discovered during the trip were a pickle jar and a plastic molding off a vehicle. The group tries to recycle as much of what they find as possible, Petrie said.
Nike's choice to prominently feature exiled NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick in the company's 30th anniversary "Just Do It" campaign prompted a number of consumers - who are opposed to Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem - to burn their shoes. However, the advertisement has done little to hurt the company on Wall Street, as Nike stock closed at an all-time high of $83.47 on Thursday. Nike did suffer a nearly 3 percent dip the day after the ad was released, according to CNN Money's Paul La Monica, but its stock has been on the rise ever since.
Don't let the cold weather kick your creativity. Some celebrities are doing more than simply grabbing their coats on the way out of the door. They, along with their stylists, are thinking of new ways to work weather-proof clothing into their outfits, thus creating standout street style. The resulting iterations aren't hard to recreate. With a few pulls and tugs, we're adding these new styles to our wardrobe arsenal, keeping our winter wardrobe hot, even when it's cold outside. Case in point: Kim Kardashian's off-shoulder trench.

Kennedy, who has no knowledge of what was said at the meeting, claimed that Trump sold out our security, democracy, and credibility. Apparently, he wants the translator to confirm his conspiracy theory. But why stop with the translator? Meetings with Putin aren’t the only opportunity to sell out the U.S. Why not demand testimony about what is said at meetings of the National Security Council or during conversations between Trump and John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, Gen. Mattis, etc? Why not make Trump wear a microphone and a body camera at all times?
With almost 30 years of constant creative output and touring, Melissa Etheridge has come to appreciate what technology and thoughtful marketing can do to amplify her voice and connect her to fans. Adweek's sibling, the Clio Awards, will welcome Etheridge at its annual gala this Wednesday at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where she will be introduced by Clio Music juror Jennifer Breithaupt, svp, global head of entertainment marketing of Citi. Etheridge will then introduce live performances by X Ambassadors and Salt-N-Pepa, both on Clio and Billboard's Top Commercials Chart (powered by Shazam).
Police detained dozens of opposition protesters in Kazakhstan's largest city on Saturday after the exiled nemesis of long-time leader Nursultan Nazarbayev called for rallies across the country. An AFP correspondent saw a mixture of plainclothes police wearing black and officers in uniform detain at least 30 protesters, some of whom were elderly, and place them in police vans in the former capital Almaty as they gathered for a planned demonstration. The rare opposition protest ostensibly backing educational reforms was called for on social media by Mukhtar Ablyazov, an exiled oligarch who is 77-year-old Nazarbayev's most significant political opponent.
A female partygoer was allegedly the victim of sexual battery inside a San Jose State University fraternity house, according to police. Police said the victim, who was not injured during the encounter, was attending a Saturday night party inside of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity house when an unidentified man "unlawfully touched her." A brother belonging to the fraternity, who wished to remain anonymous, told NBC Bay Area that the woman was dancing when the man touched her inappropriately. She reportedly pushed him away and punched him in the chest before the suspect took off from the scene.
The team that brought us the first neurally remote controlled beetle has a new paper out today proposing a huge step forward in brain-computer interfaces. In an article published the arXiv Quantitative Biology archive, Dongjin Seo, Michael Maharbiz, and colleagues from the University of California at Berkeley propose a system they call 'Neural Dust'. Brain-computer interfaces today generally work by sticking electrodes into the brain. That runs into severe problems - all those electrodes cause trauma as they penetrate the brain, and leave wires that wind through and between the brain's neurons, potentially attracting scar tissue or driving the brain to reject the implant.
Saudi Arabia on Thursday slammed US President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, calling the move "unjustified and irresponsible". Trump ended seven decades of US ambiguity on the status of the disputed city on Wednesday, prompting an almost universal diplomatic backlash and fears of new bloodshed in the Middle East. He also kicked off the process of moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. "The kingdom expresses great regret over the US president's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel," said a Saudi royal court statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.
In the first game of the newly introduced Masters Division the Busselton Magpies Masters hosted the Carey Park Panthers at the Geographe Leisure Centre and were up against some tough opposition. The game started out goal for goal but by the end of the first quarter Carey Park started pulling away, to lead 16-8 .The experience of a team that's played together for awhile was evident in the Panthers' play as they dominated in the second quarter and piled on another 16 goals and went to the half-time break leading 32-12. The Magpies made changes at the main break and started to gel as a team.

While sales managers love the real-time visibility into their team’s activities so they can forecast sales with confidence, there is still an untapped goldmine sitting in salesforce.com databases and the sales analytics in salesforce.com aren’t able to tap into it and integrate it with other meaningful data. Birst’s Salesforce Reporting and Analytics helps sales managers analyze all of the critical salesforce.com data to uncover insightful pipeline information.
What is the purpose of Renter’s Insurance? Renters insurance covers you and your possessions as a renter of an apartment or house. A standard renter’s policy protects your personal property, in many cases of theft or damage, and may pay for temporary living expenses if your rental is damaged and unlivable. It may also protect you from personal liabilities. Would my landlord’s insurance cover me? Almost always no. Your personal items such as clothes, stereo, furniture, laptops, etc. are not covered by your landlord’s insurance.
PHILADELPHIA - Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine walked through the clubhouse Sunday morning, making sure he had enough healthy players to field a representative lineup against the Phillies. Against his better judgment, Valentine kept Adrian Gonzalez in right field and David Ortiz at first base. He also used catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia in a day game after a night game. With outfielders Cody Ross and Ryan Sweeney out, the Sox started the game with only three players available off the bench. One was rookie Che-Hsuan Lin, who was summoned from the minors earlier in the day.
Sweet tooth: Bengalis use 2 tbsp sugar in tomato chutney. My best friend Raka has a maternal grandmother who is 96. Today she lies infirm and barely coherent after a lifetime of eating what must rank as an extremely spartan diet. It was not economics that imposed the diet: It was a mixture of societal expectations and her own conscience. Up until three decades ago, Bengali widows were expected by society to cook on a separate stove, using their own cooking vessels—mainly kaasha or bell metal—and maintain a separate set of tableware.
(MS) - With debates continuing to rage on over the future of the world's environment, more and more research is being done into the viability of renewable energy sources. While some have already begun to embrace such sources, many more are still in the dark as to just what renewable energy sources are. Renewable energy sources are those that can be replenished in a very small period of time. The most common of these sources include the following. Biomass: Biomass is organic material made from plants and animals and contains energy from the sun.
Aug. 7 - Summary: Tesla beat sales forecast, turns surprise profit; Groupon revenues better; S&P 500 suffers first 3-day slide since June; Time Warner lifted by ''Man of Steel''; AOL jumps into web video ad market.

GRENOBLE, France - Michael Schumacher's family is "confident" that the Formula One legend will recover from a life-threatening skiing accident that left him in a coma late last year, a spokeswoman said Wednesday. "We are and remain confident that Michael will pull through and will wake up. "There sometimes are small, encouraging signs, but we also know that this is the time to be very patient," read the statement from Sabine Kehm. Fans of Michael Schumacher gathered to pay tribute on the F1 legend's 45th birthday as he lay in a coma in a French hospital after a skiing accident last weekend.

Sarah first competed in Wheelchair Basketball at Stoke Mandeville in 1997 when she was participating in the National Junior Games. In 2000, Sarah was selected to compete at the Paralympic Games in Sydney, aged just 16 years old. However, her most memorable moment in the sport was winning the bronze medal at the 2003 European Championships in Hamburg, which resulted in the team’s qualification for the 2004 Paralympic Games in Athens. Sarah describes former team-mate Ann Wild as the most influential person in the sport. In addition to her passion for Wheelchair Basketball, Sarah is also looking forward to following the Equestrian events at London 2012.
There are clothes that make news and clothes that women want to wear. Some designers manage to do both while others just concentrate on making wearable clothes for real women, as do many designers who showed their fall collections last week. And the world of fashion could not go on for long without them. Adrienne Vittadini's phenomenal success is built on her ability to catch the mood of the moment and interpret it for the woman who likes clothes but is not obsessive about them. A Vittadini show gives an immediate distillation of the season's trends.
The best place to build the wind farms of the future is the open ocean. While the breeze can be frustratingly variable on land, if you travel just 20 miles off the coastline, the wind blows at a consistent clip of around 33 feet per second. But along most parts of the coastal United States, the ocean floor drops off quickly. That makes standard offshore turbines, the kind that are fixed to the sea bottom for stability, too expensive to be worth it. Two companies, Sway and Principle Power, are currently testing a new kind of technology to combat this problem: floating wind turbines.
The Eagles couldn’t finish off a similar play against Tucker in last year’s state semifinals, and Northside went on to fumble on the next play and lost when the Tigers returned it the length of the field for a touchdown. “We preach it, ‘Get it in the end zone. Get it in the end zone.’ He did it right there,” Northside head coach Kevin Kinsler said. Hill’s electric play in the second half helped the Eagles (9-0) fend off a furious rally by the Demons (7-2).
Mary Hawkes made the most of her time in Bernalillo County Juvenile Detention Center – she read books, studied for her GED and wrote stories about her life growing up in Los Lunas, parents dying when she was young and being adopted. But one of her favorite things to do was to go to music class with teacher Carolina Acuña-Olvera, who would become a mentor and mother figure after she was released from the detention center. She would orchestrate musical pieces using musical software and write lyrics to them, said Acuña-Olvera, who mentored a few other girls from the detention center.
And it could be an even bigger success thanks to Amazon's resources. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Try telling that to Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU). Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is reportedly working on a free ad-supported streaming video service that sounds an awful lot like The Roku Channel. Roku introduced The Roku Channel in September, and it's quickly grown to become a top five channel on Roku devices as well as a key piece of Roku's strategy moving forward. Rumor has it Amazon's service, tentatively called Free Dive, will license older films and TV series.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General Loretta Lynch defended President Barack Obama's executive actions curbing guns before Congress on Wednesday, telling lawmakers that the president took lawful steps to stem firearms violence that kills and injures tens of thousands of Americans yearly. "I have complete confidence that the common sense steps announced by the president are lawful," Lynch told the Senate Appropriations Committee panel that oversees the Justice Department. Early in an election year in which both parties seem ready to make guns a political issue, Lynch called Obama's moves "well-reasoned measures, well within existing legal authorities, built on work that's already underway."
The team at Fox 17 Morning News in West Michigan, U.S., has given Australia the greatest Australia Day gift — priceless reactions to an on-air taste test of Vegemite. Meteorologist Jon Shaner presented the team with a jar of the quintessentially Australian spread, sent to him by a former exchange student, to mark the occasion. The first response offered a clue as to what was to follow: "crikey." "Vegemite is a somewhat national condiment, I suppose you could call it a spread," Shaner attempts to explain.
An Australian man has racked up thousands of kilometres in flights trying to withdraw money from his bank account, after a security upgrade rendered his cash machine card invalid. Education consultant Robert Lewis had trouble accessing his cash when he tried to use his HSBC bank card, issued in Hong Kong in 2011, in his hometown of Wagga Wagga Australia, the South China Morning Post reports. He was told he would have to make a 10-hour round trip to the HSBC branch in Sydney to fill out a change of address application form in person in order to get an internet security device.
President Bush yesterday defended his friendly relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin but acknowledged that the Kremlin leader has been "wily" about whether he plans to hold onto power next year and lamented that democracy may not be in the "Russian DNA." Bush said he tried to grill Putin on the sidelines of an Asian summit last month about whether the Russian president plans to step down next year as promised. "I have no idea what he's going to do," Bush said. "I asked him when I saw him in Australia.
Baby boomers are retiring in record numbers leading to a major strain on federal and state budgets. In fact, Tennessee ranks number 18 in the country when it comes to seniors having a negative impact on the state’s economy. But there is some good news in that there is help available for aging adults right here in Shelby County. As Kim Daugherty explained, the Aging Commission of the Mid-South works to connect the elderly and their families with the tools they need. Friday is Blue and Green Day 901, which is part of National Donate Life America's month-long campaign.
April 30, 2012  Teresa MacBain admits that when she was ordained as a minister, she had big questions. She thought they'd make her faith stronger, but instead they haunted her. Then one day, she couldn't take it anymore. In a move that's left her unemployed and nearly friendless, MacBain has come out as an atheist — and she says it's a big relief. April 27, 2012  It's been 20 years since four police officers were acquitted in the beating of Rodney King, and Los Angeles erupted in race-fueled riots.
SEOUL, Nov. 6 (UPI) -- Right-wing South Korean lawmakers accused China and the United States Wednesday of indulging North Korea to restart talks on the country's nuclear program. Diplomats involved in the stalled six-party talks are making the rounds in Beijing and Washington to find ways to convince Pyongyang to stop development of nuclear weapons, Yonhap news service reported. Members of South Korea's Parliament expressed doubt the talks would succeed. "I am concerned that this seems to be a revival of past failures," said Chung Mong-jun, a member of the ruling Saenuri Party.

Pedro Rodriguez, Willian and Callum Hudson-Odoi scored a goal apiece for Chelsea, which was in full control throughout and easily could have translated its dominance into more goals.
Wade filed for custody of the boys, ages 8 and 2, earlier this week. He also asked a Chicago court that his wife Siohvaughn be psychologically evaluated. The couple separated in August 2007. Their divorce trial is scheduled to begin in June. "Our client believes that these various papers were filed as retaliation for her legitimate claims filed March 19, 2010 in the Domestic Relations Court in a Petition for Order of Protection regarding the abuse by Mr. Wade dating back to 2006," Eunice Ward, an attorney in the Chicago firm representing Siohvaughn Wade, said Thursday in an e-mail response to The Associated Press.
Jody Hudson, director of operations for Catholic Charities, has started a new nonprofit organization to honor her daughter’s legacy. For ten years, Alex Hudson suffered from painful physical symptoms that were misdiagnosed by numerous medical professionals. Despite all the tests and emergency room visits, Alex and her mother were at a loss for what was happening to her body. It wasn’t until 2017 that she was properly tested and diagnosed with Lyme disease and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a co-infection that often accompanies Lyme. Despite her suffering, Alex lived for serving others and earned a full-ride scholarship to UCLA.
AIMsights educates corporate clients about consumer trends with boomers and millennials, the two age groups driving home product sales. Metaphase provides clients with research about the ergonomics and design of products that interact with the human hand but also impact emotional well-being. Boomers are aging in place and want to do it gracefully. They also have the highest level of disposable income in history and an awareness of what constitutes good design. They have little tolerance for lousy products. Until recently, Rutter says, companies have not done a good job of designing products for older adults with what he calls the “dignity factor” in mind.
ASPEN, Colo.—Instagram didn't start out as Instagram. It started out as … Burbn. Kevin Systrom, the creativity researcher Keith Sawyer explains, was a fan of Kentucky whiskeys. So when he created a location-based iPhone app—one driven by the success of networking app Foursquare—he named it after the booze. The app was complicated, but it took Systrom just a few months to build: Burbn let users check in at particular locations, make plans for future check-ins, earn points for hanging out with friends, and post pictures of the meet-ups. Burbn was not, however, terribly successful.
Al Gore's "smart growth" plan: A no-brainer? Think again. When Vice President Al Gore unveiled the Clinton administration's new initiative to curb urban sprawl last week, you could sense both the peril and the promise in the move. That is, if you noticed it at all. Gore announced the administration's "Livability Agenda" just as the Senate took up President Clinton's impeachment trial, when the Washington press corps was busy chasing down every last nuance of Sen. Trent Lott's ruminations and ignoring everything else.

Hearts today condemned alleged racial abuse aimed at Demetri Mitchell and Uche Ikpeazu during Sunday's Scottish Cup win over Auchinleck Talbot. Police are working with Hearts and Auchinleck officials to identify visiting fans believed to have verbally abused Mitchell and Ikpeazu from Tynecastle Park's Roseburn Stand. The Edinburgh club praised the conduct of the vast majority of Talbot supporters but insisted racism cannot be tolerated in Scottish football. "There is no place for this type of anti-social behaviour at Tynecastle Park," said a Hearts spokesperson. "We will co-operate fully with the police and Auchinleck Talbot to help them identify those responsible.

A Hucknall man who was caught driving while banned for the second time has been spared jail. Dean Lewis Penwarden, 31, of Salterford Road, admitted driving while disqualified and without a licence when he appeared at Mansfield court on Thursday. The court heard police saw his Land Rover Discovery parked on a grass verge near the gold club in Blidworth, at 11pm on April 22. Robert Carr, prosecuting, said two men ran off and the Land Rover was driven off, but stopped a short distance away. He initially gave a false name, but a check on the police computer revealed he was disqualified.
The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against the state of California, charging that its newly enacted net neutrality law places “unlawful burdens” on the federal government's efforts to deregulate the internet. The suit was filed within hours of California Gov. Jerry Brown signing the net neutrality bill into law. California’s net neutrality law cleared both houses of the legislature by wide margins. The law reimposes the standard enacted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the Obama administration in 2015. It requires all internet service providers to treat all internet traffic the same.
FRANKFURT, Jan. 20 - A high-stakes boardroom battle at Volkswagen ended in a truce Friday, as Ferdinand K. Piëch, the company's chairman and an heir to the Porsche fortune, agreed to step down next year in return for two Porsche executives gaining seats on the board. Mr. Piëch, a powerful figure who was once Volkswagen's chief executive, has been accused by shareholders and other board members of a conflict of interest since Porsche, the sports car maker controlled by his family, acquired 18.5 percent of Volkswagen's shares last fall. Porsche asserted that its investment entitled it to two seats on the Volkswagen board.

The shutdown of the US government — now in its record 28th day — is becoming a drag on economic growth, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank said Friday. John Williams, who also holds the influential vice chairmanship of the Federal Reserve’s policy committee, reportedly told a gathering the government work stoppage could shave as much as a full percentage point off GDP growth in the first quarter. In an address delivered to a New Jersey banking association, Williams said the shutdown was among “emerging headwinds to growth,” according to his prepared remarks.
Q. How do I make furniture I inherited look contemporary? A. Congratulations on not ditching the heirlooms, even though they may not reflect your taste. I also approve of your attempt to figure out how to meld them with your décor. Too many people, myself included, avoid taking possession of heirlooms for a variety of reasons, only to regret deacquisitioning them at a garage sale or in an auction. Just because your mother covered her Chippendale-style sofa in a well-mannered brocade doesn't mean you can't reupholster it in a bold contemporary pattern.
A week after Britain’s current prime minister and leader of the Conservative Party Theresa May survived a vote of no confidence in her leadership (200 to 117) amid tensions surrounding her Brexit deal, we came across this photo of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher during her visit to Ras Al Khaimah in 1998. Thatcher, who held office from 1979 to 1990 and led the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1980, first visited the UAE in 1981, when she was in the capital to assist with negotiations for the supply of military hardware and training facilities to the UAE.
Articles of incorporation are the first step to forming a corporation. Filing articles of incorporation, also called a corporate charter, offers your company tremendous benefits, such as protection from creditors and tax advantages. Articles of incorporation are the way that businesses formally acknowledge that they intend to form a corporation. This document also details how you plan to structure and run your corporation. The idea of the corporation as a separate entity goes back to ancient times, but the modern corporation developed out of Queen Elizabeth I's East Indian Trading Company in 1601, reports Citizen Works.
London: United Breweries Group chairman Vijay Mallya stoked political controversy on Wednesday, saying he met finance minister Arun Jaitley before taking a flight to London in March 2016 amid ballooning business debts, a claim the minister denied. The 62-year-old former Kingfisher Airline boss, who was in London to appear before the Westminster Magistrates’ Court to challenge an extradition request by India on fraud and money laundering charges, was asked by reporters if he was “tipped off" to leave the country. “I left because I had a scheduled meeting in Geneva.
Pork sliders are quick to make and can be served as an appetizer or in pairs to make up a meal. Pork sliders topped with chipotle chili, adobo sauce, avacado, tomato, and cilantro on a brioche bun. Through this series, Feinstein highlights his interest in our “attraction to things that we know are ‘bad’ for us.” In his book, "Fast Food Nation," Eric Schlosser argues that at this point in history, we are conditioned from childhood, through branding and advertising, to seek out fast food.
Businesses warned over Wireless Lan weaknessTens of thousands of UK businesses need to reconsider their use of wireless networking technology or risk exposing commercially sensitive data to hackers, analysts have warned. Wireless Lan (WLan) equipment is inherently insecure because of a flaw in the encryption cipher standard, wireless security consultancy Skygate Technology said. The flaw means that hackers using 802.11b equipment can penetrate not only wireless networks but also parts of the fixed network holding confidential corporate data. Skygate recommends using IPsec virtual private network security technology, which creates secure "tunnels" for connections between devices on otherwise accessible networks.
HR Professionals’ Day was celebrated on January 25, 2011, at Hotel Ashok, Bangalore.

The programme was attended by a large number of people, who came to listen to the chief guest of the programme, who was none other than a strong crusader against corruption, Karnataka State Lokayukta Justice N Santosh Hegde.
"I had a choice: to be replaced or to own the technology that was going to be my replacement." DECEMBER 20th, 2017- Roy LaManna is no stranger to the music industry. Performing in local bands until he was eighteen, his passion for music started early. In his early twenties, LaManna took on the production side. At the time, the music industry was experiencing a bit of a renaissance. With digital media becoming more accessible to the masses in the early 2000s, independent artists were empowered to produce their own music videos using camcorders, not much unlike making home videos.
In order to cut costs, the new budget will thus eliminate positions from the armed forces and initiate changes to the pension and health care plans for military vets. Those changes will help balance the Defense Department’s budget as the Pentagon unveils that it will continue to invest billions in cutting edge weaponry and cyberspace capabilities. [T]he US will rely more heavily on an agile, dispersed arsenal of troops and increased surveillance space age weaponry presence. “Yes, our military will be leaner, but the world must know that the United States will maintain its military superiority,” [Obama] said.
Zillow Group topped $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2017, and the Seattle-based real estate data company said it also had a record quarter for revenue to close out the year. Zillow reported $1.07 billion in revenue in 2017, beating analyst expectations and up 27 percent from 2016 when it brought in $846.6 million in revenue. In the fourth quarter, Zillow logged non-GAAP earnings of $0.19 per share on a record $282.3 million in revenue. Analysts surveyed in advance by Yahoo Finance expected earnings of $0.19 per share on $277.8 million in revenue.
From the beginning of the War on Terror, the mainstream media has been working to bring home the bad news on the war, virtually to the exclusion of any good news. Even if they've had to fabricate it on occasion. Do you remember the "Mai Lai Massacre of the Iraq War?" It was a Time Magazine cover story in June of 2006. Christopher Matthews interviewed Congressman Jack Murtha (D-PA) on national television, and Murtha said that Marines, in cold blood, had executed more 20 innocent civilians in Haditha, Iraq.
The city of Houston recently went through terrible flooding due to Hurricane Harvey but came out #HoustonStrong. Despite Harvey and the crushing news of the Supreme Court allowing Trump to keep blocking refugee resettlement, here is a uplifting story from the city with the largest population of resettled refugees, highlighting the need for us to keep fighting for them. Outside Minute Maid Park, the Houston Astros stadium, milling amongst the blue and orange fans, Ghulam Kehar waits for Dayana Halawo and her family with tickets and a T-shirt to wear as she throws the ceremonial first pitch.
Chicago shoppers will have to stay on the move. On Nov. 1, Clever Alice will have a new address. A long-time fixture of the Chicago shopping scene, Clever Alice is packing up its inventory of cute dresses, flirty tops and fun accessories from such cutting-edge designers as Kitchen Orange, Prairie Underground and Casting and moving across town from River North to Bucktown. Owner Tammie Chaponot (no, her name's not Alice) was feeling the crunch of the seemingly endless CTA Brown Line construction project (her boutique is right under the "L" on Franklin and Chicago).
We are constantly complaining about living in Ithaca. Whether it’s because of the hills, the cold or the bizarre mixed form of precipitation that we have to walk through on the way to class, perhaps these complaints are warranted. We often can get caught up in the complaining, rather than working together constructively to improve the community around us. In a world of prelims, papers, projects and never ceasing deadlines, who actually has time to care? It’s hard enough to truly be an active citizen within the Cornell bubble, let alone to venture outside of it.
Parking has long been an issue for a popular Perkins Road overpass area already flush with restaurants, bars and shops. With the area continuing to attract new retailers, some business owners are concerned the problem will only get worse. Even more worrisome to them is what will happen once work begins on the I-10 widening project. A new rooftop restaurant and bar, Bumsteers, is expected to open soon in the former Crispy Catch building near the overpass that’s been expanded to double its original size. New townhomes are also coming to the Zee Zee Gardens neighborhood.
Tina Smith — a triple amputee whose motorized wheelchair is too heavy and bulky to fit in any of her family member’s cars — waited four hours after work this week for her MTA MobilityLink driver to take her home, leaving her sobbing out of frustration. The Maryland Transit Administration’s transportation service for people with disabilities has seen a dramatic increase in the number of times it was late picking up riders as the agency implements a new three-year, $299 million contract that revamps its dispatch system. In March, drivers were late for 22 percent of 160,000 trips, up from 11 percent in December.
People are making many critical mistakes when it comes to applying sunscreen — mistakes that may risk their lives as the incidence of melanoma skin cancer reaches epidemic proportions, says the director of the melanoma clinic at the McGill University Health Centre. Dermatologist Beatrice Wang says most people don’t apply nearly enough sunscreen, nor often enough. They don’t understand what they should really be looking for in SPF protection and they’re choosing more “natural” brands because they eschew chemicals — but they are seriously compromising their protection by doing so.
The federal budget stalemate that stands to trigger a government shutdown shifted Thursday from a debate over spending cuts to a fight over the thorny policy issues of abortion and environmental regulation that have divided Democrats and Republicans for years. Facing a deadline of midnight Friday, negotiators worked day and night in an effort to strike a compromise as the policy demands loomed as a major new obstacle. For a third straight day, President Obama called House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to meetings at the White House.
A crew traveled to the singer’s hometown of Corpus Christi to work with her family and visit The Selena Museum. The crew worked with the family to ensure accuracy in the singer’s “iconic pose and expression, to choosing her signature hairstyle, makeup and wardrobe,” the news release said. The figure reportedly cost about $350,000. The figure will be dressed in an outfit similar to the one worn by Selena at a Feb 7, 1993, concert in Corpus Christi. Last month the Hollywood Walk of Fame announced it was adding Selena to its Class of 2017 stars for the recording category.
Chimichurri is the South American green herb sauce that goes with just about everything. Easy to put together, it tastes best freshly prepared. When green garlic is in season in spring and early summer, use that; or substitute 2 or 3 regular garlic cloves at other times of the year. To keep it green and fresh tasting, add the vinegar just before serving. Char the asparagus in a hot cast-iron skillet or griddle, over hot coals, or under the broiler. Pencil-thin asparagus cooks quite quickly this way, but medium-size spears may be substituted.
More than15 million American homeowners currently owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, up from 13.9 million in the previous three months. The numbers indicate that higher foreclosure rates could be on the horizon, a potential trend supported by a sobering report from real estate website Zillow.com that details 27 percent of homeowners are "underwater." That&apos;s up from 23.2 percent the previous quarter. Economist David Blitzer with Standard & Poor&apos;s tells Fox News the new numbers need to be put in perspective.
Microsoft has temporarily pulled its recently released Windows RT 8.1 update for ARM-based devices due to an unexplained issue. Microsoft has pulled temporarily its recently released Windows RT 8.1 update from the Windows Store due to a vaguely explained "situation." Microsoft pulled the RT 8.1 update some time in the morning of October 19, as reported by WinBeta.org, two days after it first made it available for download by existing Windows RT users. “Microsoft is investigating a situation affecting a limited number of users updating their Windows RT devices to Windows RT 8.1.
Darryl Strawberry's main concern now is just getting healthy again. He figures if he can do that, the home runs and RBIs will come. "I was hitting home runs before I was hurt," Strawberry said before starting a rehab stint Friday with the Dodgers' Class AAA Albuquerque team. "The main thing here will be working on mechanics." Strawberry was set to start in right field for Albuquerque in Friday night's Pacific Coast League game against Phoenix. He was expected to play five or six innings, Albuquerque manager Bill Russell said.
SAN DIEGO – Prosecutors say a former Marine has pleaded guilty to submitting nearly $100,000 in fake rent receipts to the Marine Corps for reimbursement. U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said Thursday that former Gunnery Sgt. Devin Pierre Alario submitted the requests while he was stationed at Camp Pendleton from 2009 to 2011. Neither Alario nor his attorney could be immediately reached for comment. Prosecutors say Alario submitted fake receipts and leases to falsely claim reimbursement for rent that he never paid on 27 occasions. According to the plea agreement, Alario sought reimbursement for up to $3,800 a month and he made more than $95,000 from the scheme.
The S2110A runs Android 4.0.3 "Ice Cream Sandwich" with some modifications from Lenovo. The biggest change you'll notice is Lenovo's home screen and transition animations. Instead of sliding between adjacent home screens, you get an animated cube. It gives the home screens a bit of a three-dimensional feel, but at the cost of smoothness and responsiveness. You can revert to the default animation, but even that is far too choppy for a tablet in this price range. The home screens are littered with custom Lenovo widgets, including a Lenovo App Store widget that I could not get to work.
Syfy has renewed “Wynonna Earp” for a third season.

Big Spring police report that a 22-year-old man died Tuesday in a motorcycle crash after avoiding officers trying to conduct a traffic stop. About 8:30 p.m., a 2017 Honda CBR 600R motorcycle turned west onto FM 700 in front of an officer. The officer attempted to stop the motorcycle in the 2300 block of South Goliad Street after observing it being driven recklessly and the driver not signaling turns, according to a news release from Big Spring Police Chief Chad Williams. The motorcycle driver ignored the officer's emergency lights and siren, police reported. The Department of Public Safety assisted Big Spring Police in the incident.
Who benefits from reduced sales taxes? The effect of sales taxes is hotly debated. These taxes on consumption raise revenue for local governments, but do they also stymie business and hurt consumers? In America, sales taxes are collected by municipalities and states and generally added to a good’s sale price at checkout. In many other countries, like France, “value-added tax” (VAT) is included in the stated sale price and collected by the national government. A new study by the National Bureau of Economic Research looks at who benefits when a sales tax is repealed.

TThe Crown Prince of Soul is dead. Otis Redding, 26 years old, a former well-driller from Macon, Georgia, died in a plane crash in an icy Wisconsin lake on December 10. With him were the five teen-age members of the Bar-Kays, a group which made the popular instrumental, “Soul Finger,” and who backed Otis on his recent tours and appearances. Otis was headed from Cleveland, Ohio, to a Sunday evening concert in Madison, Wisconsin. It was his first tour in the private plane he had just purchased.
PARIS/KARACHI: Pakistan has been added to the grey list of countries involved in providing monetary assistance to terrorism and related causes, Geo News reported, after a Wednesday meeting of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) here confirmed the decision. Presenting Pakistan's case at the FATF talks in Paris, Dr Shamshad Akhtar, the interim minister for finance and planning, apprised the watchdog of the steps the country has taken to stem money laundering and terror financing, and put up a robust case for not placing its name on the greylist.
Will a £6m Facebook grant compromise the independence of a pioneering new AI ethics institute? Experts taking big tech money should beware getting gagged. Over the weekend, Facebook revealed it had struck a partnership with the Technical University of Munich – one of the world’s leading centres for artificial intelligence research – to establish a new AI ethics institute. Facebook has pledged to give the centre $7.5m (£5.8m) over the next five years, in an attempt to “advance the growing field of ethical research on new technology and explore fundamental issues affecting the use and impact of AI”.
Don't expect Kanye West to show any mercy during his upcoming appearance on "Family Feud." The rapper's mother-in-law Kris Jenner shared a teaser on Twitter for the famous family's highly anticipated episode of the game show, and West quickly makes it clear he's not holding back. "I'm here to win bro," West says in the clip. "I'm here to win." The short video also shows West buzzing in and answering "lips" when asked what makes the show's host, Steve Harvey, "a good kisser."
Next up is the point & figure chart for GLD, the gold exchange traded fund. It shows a bullish trend with a significant upside price projection. Below is one of our favorites: the long term chart of gold going back to 1975. As you can clearly see, prices peaked in the late 70's at over $750.00, and have recently rallied up to $730.40. In the process a cup formation has been constructed on the chart. Presently gold has been in a trading range just below the rim of the cup on the right hand side of the chart.
Here's a blast from the past: Remember Christian Okoye, the “Nigerian Nightmare”? Junior Seau does. Here's a blast from the past. Remember Christian Okoye, the “Nigerian Nightmare”? Junior Seau does. As an AFC West defender for the back half of Okoye's all-too-brief, six-year career with the Kansas City Chiefs, Seau was charged with tackling the 6-1, 253-pound running back, who seemingly made the ground shake with every footstep. We bring up Okoye's name because Seau and the rest of the Patriots defense have another rhino-sized runner in their sights.

MINOT, N.D. - Jury selection has begun in the trial of a Minot man accused of breaking into a home last August and opening fire. Prosecutors have charged 45-year-old Travis Yoney with six counts, including A-felony attempted murder. Investigators say Yoney fired a 22-caliber rifle at a southwest Minot home on Aug. 23. They say he forced his way in and fired again at a 30-year-old victim, but missed. The victim managed to subdue Yoney until police arrived. He faces up to 20 years in prison on the A-felony charge if convicted. The trial is scheduled to run through Thursday.
The meteorological phenomenon known as “El Niño” will likely return to Colombia this summer and last until next year, local media reports. In a statement released on June 26, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) predicted the full effects of the weather phenomenon, which can cause extreme rain and drought, will likely be felt starting in the early fall. “Climate model outlooks suggest a 60% likelihood for El Niño to become established between June and August, rising to 75-80% for the October to December period,” read the WMO statement.
Uber driver Sahin Kaya, of Melrose, drove nurse Shacuiya Lang, of Brockton, around the Boston area so she could administer flu vaccines. For four hours Thursday, people in Boston and 35 other cities had the opportunity to summon a nurse to their doorstep to give them a flu shot. This experiment in “on-demand health care,” which involved the use of hundreds of Uber drivers, heralds what some consider the wave of the future: bringing health care to the people, instead of waiting for them to come and get it.
Five Aussie cities have been ranked among the world’s 20 priciest cities for housing prices, with many of the country’s regional towns also deemed more unaffordable than New York. It may come as little consolation for house hunters but Sydney has lost its seven year grip on the title of world’s second least affordable housing market. The Harbour City’s current housing slump, which has pushed values down by about 9 per cent over the past year, meant it slipped to third spot on urban consultancy firm Demographia’s annual global ranking of world cities.
ANN ARBOR, MI -- Celebrating both his birthday and a decisive Election Night win at the Necto nightclub, Jeff Hayner joked that it's like he was born to serve on the Ann Arbor City Council. "The people have spoken and it's time for some change and it's time to take back the things that we want. It's time to project our shared values," Hayner, the city's next 1st Ward representative, said to a crowd of supporters who sang "Happy Birthday" to him under a disco ball.
At 100, Eva Zeisel is not afraid of contradicting herself, especially on the question of timeliness. While she has long held that design represents its current moment, she cannot deny—nor does she want to—her own work’s enormously enduring appeal. Her simple, fluid forms and sensual curves in everything from her tableware to tiles to glassware to furniture to rugs have identified her as one of the most innovative and influential designers of the twentieth century. Born in Budapest in 1906, Zeisel wanted to be a painter and took up pottery only to support that.
Just one week after the previous updates were released, the Mozilla development team have issued updates for the Firefox web browser and for the Thunderbird news and email client to close a critical security vulnerability affecting these products. According to the developers, the updates address a critical security issue that could potentially lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code on a victim's system. The previously reported zero day vulnerability (CVE-2010-3765), which was used to attack visitors to the Nobel Peace Prize web site, was related to a bug that lead to a heap buffer overflow when mixing document.write and DOM insertion.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has in the credit policy statement signalled its intent to revamp the business of priority sector lending—a euphemism for subsidized and targeted lending to the less privileged. Taking up the recommendation of the Raghuram Rajan committee on financial sector reforms, RBI is setting up a working group to create priority sector lending certificates (PSLC). All entities lending to the so-called priority sector will be covered; any surplus beyond the stipulated limits for each entity can be sold to those who are in deficit. Something akin to what we have seen in the case of a carbon credit market.

GOOGLE Maps has a bold mission to document every corner of Earth – but some places are so secret they're not allowed to be snapped. From military bases, mysterious islands and even a random house in Stockton-on-Tees, there's no shortage of secret spots Google Maps won't show you. Moruroa is a small atoll in the southern Pacific Ocean. It's not clear why much of the island is censored, but some suspect it relates to the island's nuclear history. France undertook significant nuclear testing on the atoll between 1966 and 1996 – with as many as 181 tests performed during this time period.
Authorities trying to recover a dead body spotted floating off the Hawaii coast had to call off the rescue after a tiger shark started circling and pulled the person under. Hikers spotted the body in the water about 30 yards off the shore in North Kohala at about 11am on Sunday. A large tiger shark had started circling the body when Hawaii County fire officials arrived at the scene soon after. Officials said they made multiple attempts to get the body with a Billy Pugh net but their efforts were thwarted by the hungry predator. The body was pulled under water by the shark soon after.
For our fall Directors' Special, Creativity polled a slew of creatives and broadcast producers from 25 top agencies, seeking their choices for the best directors in the following genres: Action, Comedy, Documentary, Fashion, Visual Style, Performance, Kids, Tabletop and Cars. We also tallied Overall Vote-getters and solicited entries for the Most Coveted title - i.e., which director our respondents most wanted to work with. Admittedly, categories can be a nightmare. Directors have an understandable aversion to being typecast, and many of the people we polled also took issue with having to box up their brethren.
Bangladesh Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina. A Bangladeshi man who distorted and posted photos of the prime minister has been sentenced to seven years in jail under tough internet laws that critics say are used to muzzle dissent. Mohammad Monir, 35, was found guilty late Wednesday by a Dhaka cyber tribunal for doctoring and publishing on social media images of Hasina and ex-president Zillur Rahman. "He posted those distorted images in his Facebook status and made derogatory remarks in the photo captions," prosecutor Nazrul Islam Shamim told AFP. He was convicted under section 57 of the South Asian country's Information and Communication Technology (ICT) laws.
"to reposition the party in the center. They gambled that discontent with Obama alone would be sufficient to propel them back to power." The Republicans and their corporate cronies miscalculated the American resolve. "We" may have serious issues with both party's but the Republicans made it clear. No recovery for American's. Corruption as usual.. Continue the wealthy welfare fiasco..More wars of convenience..
"We" voted for US! If there were a strong third party would that have changed history? Can't say since "We" have yet to build a strong foundation under a third party ..
A dozen cyclists have undertaken an epic adventure, retracing the path of the Salamanca Arts Centre's founding director in the Tour de Haslem. In the Centre's early years there was no phone in the building, so Brian Haslem had to jump on his bike and ride to public phones to conduct his business. The Tour de Haslam saw riders create their own cycle route around the capital's remaining phone booths as part of the SAC's 35th birthday celebrations. Each cyclist carried a GPS tracking device, which drew a chart of their course, creating giant works of art, using Hobart as the canvas.
After 20 years, Peak to Peak Music Education Association has announced it will no longer hold the annual music festival in Nederland because of a lack of space in Barker Meadows Park as the town redevelops the area to include new bathrooms, a community greenhouse and a bike pump track. "It was an exceptionally difficult decision to make, but we felt that land use decisions made by the Nederland Board of Trustees and town administration have rendered the ball field unusable," the association's board of directors wrote in a letter announcing NedFest's cancellation.
ANDRE VILLAS-BOAS was furious with a challenge on goalscorer Gareth Bale which he claimed could have put the Welshman out for six months. The angry Tottenham boss said midfielder Alex Tettey's attempt to prevent Bale's 80thminute equaliser should have resulted in a red card. The Welsh winger's goal came after he took the ball on the halfway line, rode Tettey's challenge and surged into the area before cutting inside Javier Garrido to finish. "It was a beautiful goal," said Villa-Boas. "But he was extremely lucky to avoid Tettey's challenge, which could have broken his ankle.
Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, who's running in this year's very crowded Democratic primary for mayor, once again supports a garbage facility slated for the Upper East Side. "I believe residents have valid concerns that must be addressed in the implementation process, but I continue to support the five-borough plan and the construction of the East 91st Street facility," said de Blasio, in a statement sent to reporters Thursday evening. This marks something of a course-amendment. De Blasio voted for the waste transfer station when he was a member of the City Council.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath wants to skin the fat cats on the public payroll. Horwath, who has long crusaded for a hard cap on the salaries of public officials, will introduce a private member’s bill Thursday that would limit taxpayer-funded executive compensation to $418,000 a year. That figure is twice the $209,000 salary of Premier Kathleen Wynne. “When a public sector CEO takes home more in a year than the average family earns in two decades, people feel like their money isn’t being respected,” the NDP leader told a Queen’s Park news conference Wednesday.
Sen. John Kerry says he will “almost certainly” send his own team of experts to Iraq to refine his policy position on the war-torn country as he prepares for the presidential election, Time magazine reports. “I may ask some Democratic colleagues and experts to go to Iraq and make this assessment so I have a strong basis on which to proceed,” the Massachusetts senator and presumed Democratic Party presidential nominee told the magazine. Mr. Kerry mentioned the possibility of dispatching Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, foreign policy adviser Rand Beers and aide Nancy Stetson, Agence France-Presse said.
Home sales down. But six cities defy housing gloom. Home sales plunged in July and housing prices may dip again. But in six metropolitan areas, the housing picture is far brighter: Home values are rising and median prices are already well ahead of their peak during the housing bubble. Is your city on the list? Sharmon Holley checks over a table full of Valentine’s Day floral arrangements at the Kabloom Florist shop in Shreveport, La., in 2007. Since that time, the metro area has avoided the fallout from the housing bubble and instead seen median home prices rise 15 percent.
New single is about 'a boy I liked at a certain time,' says singer. Forget Drew, the inspiration for "Teardrops on My Guitar," or Joe Jonas, who sparked "Forever & Always." When Taylor Swift sat down to write her latest hit song, "Mine," she had a different dude, who remains a mystery, on the brain. "I was reflecting back on a boy I liked at a certain time," she told Rolling Stone about the tune, which will appear on her forthcoming album Speak Now.
Tony Stewart is chasing history and a championship. He can become the first driver to start 3 for 3 in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship. He can become the first owner-driver to win the Cup since Alan Kulwicki in 1992. He can become a lot of things except interested in talking about his place in the record book. Smoke only cares about his result this weekend at Dover International Speedway. “Come talk to me in eight weeks and we’ll talk about it,” Stewart said Friday. It’s a conversation that Stewart could have if he keeps up his strong start to the Chase.
ITALIAN defense contractor Finmeccanica paid a shell corporation in Panama a 10 percent commission on a $250 million contract it had with the government of Ricardo Martinelli. According to documents obtained by TVN news, the payments were made to Agafia Corporation, which has been linked to jailed italian fixer Valter Lavítola reports La Prensa. Lavitola has been accused by Italian prosecutors of arranging bribes on behalf of Panama officials in exchange for lucrative contracts. The beneficiaries of these payments were Martinelli and his associates, according to prosecutors. Agafia had "consultancy agreements" with Finmeccanica subsidiaries that resulted in payments of $25 million.
LONDON (Reuters) - British researchers have identified two common genetic mutations that increase the risk of osteoporosis and related bone fractures, according to a study released on Tuesday. These changes were present in 20 percent of the people studied and highlight the potential role of screening for the bone-thinning disease that mainly affects women after menopause, they said in the journal Lancet. “Eventually, a panel of genetic markers could be used in addition to environmental risk factors to identify individuals who are most at risk for osteoporotic fractures,” Tim Spector and Brent Richards, researchers at King’s College London wrote.
Possible No. 1 overall pick in the 2019 NHL Draft Jack Hughes will compete for Team USA in the U18 World Championships, starting this weekend. The Jack Hughes hype machine may already be running on high but it’s about to get kicked into high gear next week when Hughes leads Team USA into battle at the IIHF Under-18 World Championship in Sweden. In case you’ve been living under a hockey puck or you’re jumping on either the Devils’ or Rangers’ bandwagons after finding out the two teams are picking 1-2 in the 2019 NHL Draft, Hughes is the projected first overall pick.
FBI arresting a Chinese hacker with alleged links to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management breach; IBM announcing new storage software for virtual machines; and the upcoming fifth-generation Apple TV including 4K video capabilities. In a sure sign that Microsoft's coders are wrapping up development on the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, upcoming preview builds released to the Windows Insider Fast and Slow rings will feature more bug fixes and fewer new features. Microsoft is now at the point of the development cycle for the operating system where its focus is now on stabilization for release to the world, according to Dona Sarkar, head of the Windows Insider early-access program.
The NSA spying affair did not involve millions of breaches of the law, Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief of staff said this week - and told investigating MPs that work was starting soon on a mutual promise to stop spying. Roland Pofalla spent more than five hours talking with the parliamentary committee overseeing the work of the country's security agencies on Monday. Afterwards he told reporters he had written assurances from the US and the UK that they would respect German law. Initial contact between Germany's secret service, the BND, and the American National Security Agency about a "No Spy Agreement" had already taken place, he said.
Start your engines everyone! The high-tech animated racecar of the 1960s, the Mach 5, and its driver Speed Racer are heading to the big screen for a live-action adaptation. If you can believe it, the project’s actually been in the works for over 15 years. At various times, Johnny Depp was scheduled to play the title role, Vince Vaughn was cast as Racer X and Marc Levin, Jennifer Flackett, J. J. Abrams, Patrick Read Johnson, Julien Temple were all connected. Now that it’s finally on the road, the current incarnation looks like it will be a true star-studded event.
“We are actively engaged in an all-of-US-government approach in convincing European governments and European businesses alike that increased energy dependence on Russia is inconsistent with what it is we’re all trying to do in pushing back against Russia,” Pompeo told the Senate Appropriations Committee on Wednesday, at a hearing about the 2019 State Department budget. For all of Trump’s talk of “getting along better” with Russia and Bolton’s diplomacy in Moscow, the Trump administration is continuing to implement policies hostile to Russia it inherited from Barack Obama’s term in the White House.
Prepaid postage on ballot return envelopes may not have been one of the Access to Democracy reforms passed by the Legislature during this year's incredibly productive short session, but it looks like voters might be getting it anyway -- and in time for the midterms! -- if Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman prevails. "Breaking the Cycle" is a relatively short documentary that follows Jan Strømnes, warden of a maximum security prison in Norway, as he tours Attica Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison in New York. There are really no comparisons to be made; it is all stark contrasts.
Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance — the recently launched commercial P/C insurance unit of Berkshire Hathaway — announced on Thursday the appointments of Leo Carroll as senior vice president, healthcare professional liability, and William Sullivan as vice president, construction casualty.

In a setback to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on March 27, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislator from Bawana Ved Prakash formally joined the BJP days ahead of the civic polls in the presence of Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari. Tweeting Prakash’s photograph of joining the BJP and his resignation letter from the AAP, Tiwari said the popularity of BJP has frustrated the opposition parties. Delhi BJP spokesperson Tajinder Pal S Bagga speaking of the reasons why Prakash joined the BJP, said he wanted to work under the ‘saintly’ Narendra Modi’s leadership and hence was joining BJP.
Rotorua's economy is continuing to boom - enjoying a start to 2018 that saw many economic indicators outstripping the national growth rates. However, while Rotorua's gross domestic product (GDP), residential consents, guest nights and retail trade were among the indicators showing positive growth, some residents are excluded from the rewards. The Infometrics Quarterly Economic Monitor for March 2018 shows Rotorua's GDP grew by 4 per cent in the first quarter of 2018, but in the same quarter, Jobseeker Support recipients increased by 3 per cent. Nationally, GDP grew 2.7 per cent but Jobseeker Support recipients dropped by 0.5 per cent.
COLUMBUS – Good news for Ohio drivers. In a Strategic Highway Safety Plan meeting, Monday with safety organizations from across the state, leaders with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) discussed trends on Ohio roadways. Findings show that while four out of the last five years have seen a rise in traffic deaths around the state, 2018 was different. In 2018 the state saw about a 9 percent reduction in traffic deaths statewide, according to Michelle May, ODOT highway safety program manager. The numbers reflect about 100 fewer deaths in 2018 than in 2017, a number worthy of celebration, May said.

The US dollar was dozing at 117.55 yen after reaching 118.66 yen a week ago, its strongest since early February. [SYDNEY] It was hard to find a pulse in the currency market on Friday as dealers bedded down for the Christmas holidays, though the mood remains bullish for more US dollar gains in the New Year as yield spreads widen in its favour. The single currency was a shade firmer at US$1.0434, having rebounded only modestly from a nearly 14-year low of US$1.0350 set on Tuesday. The US dollar index was marginally higher at 103.05 and within striking distance of the week's 103.65 peak.
"Our answer to terror is routine, routine, routine," Sderot Mayor Eli Moyal says. Yaakov Yaakobov won't get to celebrate his son's bar mitzva next month. The father of two teenage boys died just before midnight in Beersheba's Soroka Medical Center after he was critically wounded Tuesday morning when a Palestinian-launched Kassam rocket hit the factory where he worked on the outskirts of Sderot. Four other workers were lightly wounded. "I saw him lying on the ground with blood on his face," his co-worker Tanya Basov told The Jerusalem Post.
The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.57% was down less than 0.1% at 96.93 in Monday trading, with its month-to-date loss at 0.4%. It continued to weaken even after data showed that the New York Fed’s Empire State business conditions index rebounded to a reading of 10.1 from a nearly two-year low of 3.7 in March.

Who will win their first Bergen County title? Storyline: Whatever happens, one team will walk away with their first championship. For the Panthers, a win would be unquestionably the biggest in program history. It would make them the first NJIC champion since Waldwick's 1995 team and make last year's controversial semifinal loss just a footnote in their story. A victory for the Rams would cap off a magical ride -- one that already includes six wins by a goal -- and serve as a poetic tribute four months after the loss of athletic director Jim Grasso.
Wichita Christian's Nathan Baker was voted as the Week 11 TRN Player of the Week for his performance in the Stars' 78-71 overtime victory.

ARSENAL must sign Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang this month. That’s the view of former Gunners ace Paul Mariner. Arsenal, who have tabled two bids for the Borussia Dortmund hitman, are desperate to complete the deal before the transfer window shuts on Wednesday. However, the Gunners are currently refusing to meet Dortmund’s £55m asking price, with Arsene Wenger only willing to pay around £50m. And Mariner says Arsenal must sign Aubameyang this month, claiming he’s worried for the Gunners if they don’t get the deal done in time. “Is that the right position in the No.10?
A large scale study of Scottish people's DNA is threatening to "rewrite the nation's history", according to author Alistair Moffat. Scotland, he told the Edinburgh international book festival, despite a long-held belief that its ethnic make-up was largely Scots, Celtic, Viking and Irish, was in fact "one of the most diverse nations on earth". "The explanation is simple. We are a people on the edge of beyond; on the end of a massive continent. Peoples were migrating northwest; and they couldn't get any further. We have collected them."
BEIJING (Reuters) - China aims to train astronauts from other countries who will conduct missions with their Chinese counterparts, state news agency Xinhua cited a senior official as saying on Monday. China will also share the technological achievements of its manned space program with other countries, especially with developing ones, Xinhua quoted Wang Zhaoyao, head of the country’s manned space program office, as saying. “Cooperation should be either bilateral or multilateral, with diversified and flexible models based on peace and a win-win cooperation,” he said.
IBM is bidding to expand its share of the storage market with a low-end Windows and Linux server storage system that has large system, Unix-server style capacities. In the growing competition to meet rapidly increasing storage needs, IBM's move may represent the type of storage units soon to come from competitors EMC, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems. Dave Walling, vice president of marketing for IBM storage systems, termed the newly launched ProFibre Storage Array DF4000R as "RAID for NT." It is actually aimed at Windows NT/2000, Linux and low-end Unix systems.
Chef Douglas Yeomans of Tarragon Catering shows families how to make sushi at Activate Elgin’s March into Health 2018 kickoff at Gail Borden Public Library on Saturday. In the background, Jaydenn Galarza watched as he tried sushi for the first time. Chef Douglas Yeomans couldn't make the sushi rolls fast enough during a live demo at the Saturday kickoff of Activate Elgin's March into Health 2018. His gloved hand grabbed a nori wrap, then he wet his fingers to put rice on it. He added ingredients including cucumber, red pepper, cilantro and crab to create different types of rolls.
New Line’s feature adaptation of Stephen King’s “It” has lost its director. Cary Fukunaga has dropped out of the project as director, sources confirmed on Monday. The “True Detective” director exited the project this weekend. “It” was set to be split up into two films, and sources say New Line was considering making only one movie due to budget concerns. Fukunaga, however, was adamant about making two pics. They could not agree on a budget, causing Fukunaga to clash with the studio.
MIAMI – Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez’s second successful challenge of an umpire’s call in as many days gave Julio Teheran another pickoff Sunday. Teheran threw to first base after Christian Yelich led off the Marlins’ first inning with a single. First-base umpire Sean Barber called Yelich safe, but Gonzalez challenged the call after getting the signal relayed from video-replay coordinator Horacio Ramirez, who thought first baseman Freddie Freeman tagged Yelich’s hand before he reached the base. After the play was reviewed on replay, the call was overturned and Yelich was called out.
On Sadegh Hedayat's "The Blind Owl"
Dar zendegiye shomaa, maa kojaa gharaar daareem? She was a sweet Pakistani shopkeeper. And married. "You sing a sad song just to turn it around"
Two short stories from "Aroosi-e Khaaleh, va..."
The sound of a muted but crescendoing chord slowly reaches my ears. It is a harmonica. J.D. Salinger’s "The Catcher in the Rye" and Sadegh Hedayat’s "The Blind Owl"
I just watched him. I watched the twitch of every muscle in his face. I watched his hands.
Looking forward to more ulpan-filled summers at USF – J. At this time last year, the summer ulpan program at the University of San Francisco — one of the longest running programs of its kind in the country — was in danger of being shut down. This year, it was thriving, with enrollment more than doubling compared to 2017. What has changed? The teachers are just as committed, energetic and indefatigable as ever. The students, who come from all walks of life, continue to be just as enthusiastic about learning Hebrew.
Your smartphone knows your location well enough to send a car to where you're standing in a busy city, map a morning run through the woods, or navigate inside an airport. But if you call 911 from that same mobile phone, emergency responders will only have a vague sense of where to send an ambulance, fire truck, or police car. The difference in distances can be the difference between life and death. In Cincinnati, high school student Kyle Plush died when police officers didn't find him as he lay suffocating in his minivan.
A 29-year-old woman will follow her husband to death row for the murder of their 4-year-old niece, who was beaten and starved for months before being scalded to death in a bathtub, a judge ruled Monday. Superior Court Judge Michael Wellington, accepting a jury's recommendation, sentenced Veronica Gonzales to death for the 1995 killing of Genny Rojas. She and her 31-year-old husband, Ivan, who was sentenced to death in January, become the first married couple in California on death row for the same crime. Gonzales wept quietly as Wellington announced his decision.
The year's most unlikely pop star? Ty Dolla $ign has talent to burn. An MC on the rise, his slick flow and enormous charisma has turned the rapper into one of hip hop's most sought after performers. Recently stopping by on new jams from Kanye West and Rihanna – keeping it casual – the rapper could be about to turn himself into one of 2015's most unlikely pop stars. New track 'Drop That Kitty' features a mountain of double entendres, and to top it all off chart queen Charli XCX and rising R&B vocalist Tinashe are on hand to lend some feminine charm.
Johni Esho, also known as J. Esho, is using the 2019 Junos in London as an opportunity to spotlight his work among Canadian musical greats. The Eshos were pretty much a household name in Tel Tamer, Syria. When Khoshaba and Mona, an Assyrian singer-guitarist duo, weren't dominating gigs in town, they were operating the popular Babylon, the area's only recording studio. Business was good, but the studio had to close its doors in 2005, when Khoshaba and Mona moved their growing family to Canada for greater opportunities.
Kicking off over the long Valentine's/Presidents Day weekend, the Annual Red Wine & Chocolate Tour takes place on Feb. 13-15 and Feb. 20-21.

In addition to the much anticipated new red wine releases paired with sweet and savory chocolate delights, some wineries are adding new white wine releases to the mix. The tour features a number of new activities in which visitors are encouraged to engage.
And you thought that the "repo man" business was the ultimate way to play the bust. Please. Reno, NV-based company Fast Wrap USA is the king of shrinkwrapping large items like boats and sheds and gigantic piles of lumber. And now they're ready to do it with vacant condos, according to The Real Deal Miami (via Jonathan Miller). It's perfect. These condos will have value one day, when people can get a mortgage again and want to buy a place -- if you think we've seen the last Florida real estate bubble, think again.
Sen. Rand Paul Wants Guns, Concealed Weapons Permits In Washington D.C.
Republican presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky announced Nov. 20 that he plans to introduce legislation to bring guns back to the District of Columbia, with concealed weapons permits. “For too long the Americans who live in and visit their nation’s capital have been prevented from defending themselves and their loved ones. No longer should our citizens have to choose between safety or visiting Washington, D.C.,” Paul said in the press release posted on his campaign website, RandPaul.com.
English Democrats candidate Matt O'Connor says he has halted his campaign to be London mayor. Mr O'Connor told BBC London he fell out with the party leadership over campaign funding and tactics. But his name will still appear on ballot papers as they have been printed - and many postal votes have already been cast in the 1 May contest. Mr O'Connor is best known as the founder and spokesman for the campaigning group Fathers 4 Justice. Explaining his decision to stop campaigning with less than a week to go before polling day, Mr O'Connor said he had been unhappy with the lack of coverage he was getting from the media.
This letter addresses the “change” we ordinary people voted for last fall. And my First Amendment right still entitles me to say as I please about my government without retribution of any kind. As we are all away, our educational systems are under fire, as are our wallets, but to address something far more important: What is next on the chopping block is the U.S. Constitution. A case in point is our Second Amendment rights, my personal favorite. The right to bear arms has been interpreted by the Supreme Court in many ways throughout the years.
Apr.15 - India, the world's biggest processor of diamonds, is planning to develop a trading hub for rough diamonds to reduce dependence on existing centres like Dubai and Antwerp for raw material sourcing. Hayley Platt reports. It's already the world's biggest processor of diamonds - cutting and polishing 11 out of 12 of the gems. Now India plans to create a new trading hub for rough diamonds in direct competition with Dubai and Belgium. It's one of the ways it hopes to boost exports to cut its record current account deficit. Anoop Mehta is chairman of Bharat Diamond Bourse.
Family Festival on Sunday, D-Wade did the unthinkable — he got on stage with Vanilla Ice during a performance of "Ice Ice Baby." Really? Well, seeing is believing and we couldn't make this stuff up. Jumping up and down with his arm draped over the washed rapper, Wade was having himself a ball. Although Wade, 34, was all but8 years old when "Ice Ice Baby" dropped in 1990, it looks like he has partied to this record before... and perhaps on more than one occasion.
"I have a connection with my children wherever I go...they are close to my heart," said a mom with a necklace made from her child's umbilical cord. Parents of yesterday kept their baby's hair and the first tooth their kid lost. They cherished them in boxes or taped them inside baby books that were kept in closets or the garage. Today, some parents are taking that sentimentality to a whole new level. Like turning their offspring's umbilical cord – you know, the crusty nugget that falls off a few days after baby comes home – into a piece of jewelry.
NAIROBI, Kenya—In Kenya, one of the world's most corrupt countries, the bar for public outrage at official misconduct is set pretty high. But a major new scandal involving top government figures has shocked even the most jaded Kenyans. Last month, a leading Kenyan newspaper published a detailed account by the country's former anticorruption czar of his investigation into millions of dollars in government security contracts to a company called Anglo Leasing and Finance—which, he found, never existed. The report describes how the company was a shell for some key members of President Mwai Kibaki's government.
What's Next for Tea Party Express? One of the biggest surprises of the 2010 election season happened Tuesday night when Christine O'Donnell took down frontrunner Mike Castle in the Delaware Republican Senate primary, showcasing the prowess of the Tea Party movement and its ability to affect elections in multiple, not necessarily conservative, states across the county. It can mostly be attributed to the group Tea Party Express, which poured around $250,000 into the state and later attracting the endorsements of Sarah Palin and Sen. Jim DeMint. See this post for a rundown of the group's activities in Delaware.
Metro speaks with the former Red Sox ace. It’s safe to say the Red Sox are playing the best baseball of their season – but that’s not saying much considering the way things started. They go into Thursday night’s game in Oakland standing at 40-35, tied for third place in the AL East with the Tampa Bay Rays. After a 4-10 start to the season, the Sox seem to be finally getting it. The offense remains one of the most potent in the league, and the pitching – to an extent, anyways – has improved.
Salesforce.com is in advanced discussions to acquire U.S. software maker MuleSoft, people familiar with the matter claim, as it looks to expand its offerings beyond customer relationship management software. The acquisition, which the sources said could be worth more than US$6 billion, would be Salesforce's biggest ever deal, illustrating Chief Executive Marc Benioff's push to supplement the company's cloud-based portfolio with new technology. A deal could be announced as soon as this week, the sources said, cautioning that negotiations had not been finalized and that an agreement was not certain.

The veteran officer who fatally shot a man outside an Atlanta police annex in late January was already under investigation for allegedly assaulting a patron at a Midtown gay bar, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has learned. Anthony Walters, 25, said he was badly beaten, with injuries to his face that required hospitalization, after an altercation last October with Officer Yasim Abdulahad at Bulldogs on Peachtree Street, where the policeman was providing security as a side job. “Long story short, this is about an out-of-control officer who slammed my client until he was unconscious,” said Riah Greathouse, one of Walters’ attorneys.
Redacted Mueller Report Coming Out Within 1 Week, AG Barr Tells Congress The attorney general says work is going well in redacting the special counsel's report about the Russian interference in the 2016 election — and DOJ has at least one other report coming too. Attorney General William Barr arrives to testify about the Justice Department's FY 2020 budget request before a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday.

EXCLUSIVE: American Gods star Pablo Schreiber will play astronaut Jim Lovell in Damien Chazelle’s moon-mission movie First Man. Lovell had quite the résumé: Best known as the commander of Apollo 13 — played by Tom Hanks in the 1995 Ron Howard movie — he is one of only 24 people to have flown to the moon, the first of only three to fly to the big rock twice and the only one to have flown there twice without making an actual landing. He also is the first person to fly in space four times.
The writer extolling Obamacare in Monday's newspaper is misinformed, intellectually dishonest or both! She stated that the Romney-Ryan plan "could cripple Florida's seniors" when in fact there are no forced changes in Medicare for those over age 55. Conversely, Obamacare will impose a radical change in the Medicare program with the implementation of its Independent Payment Advisory Board composed of 15 health czars. Further, we're going to be "gifted" with a health care plan we are forced to purchase and fined if we don't. It doesn't add a single new doctor but provides for 16,000 new IRS agents.
The Swedes are doing all they can to shut down The Pirate Bay, but it just won’t die. A Swedish court ordered the popular file sharing site’s bandwidth provider to cut it’s Internet access or face fines, which was enough to pressure Black Internet into action. While the ruling was handed down on Friday, the ISP did not receive the order until Monday, which it immediately complied with. But that move has apparently triggered some type of backlash which appears to be related to its decision to comply with the courts.
Brian Dumoulin chose Boston College over Maine and has represented the state perfectly. They mean no disrespect. They are Mainers who appreciate their state and otherwise cheer for their university, but are loyal to the boy next door who plays hockey. Brian Dumoulin, the star defenseman, has a following of fans whose numbers seem to be growing. “He hasn’t forgotten he’s from Biddeford,” said Deborah Dumoulin, his mom. “I think people respond to that. Everywhere I go, people of all ages come up to me to talk about Brian and Boston College.
AURORA, NY -- Thousands queued up Thursday for an average of three hours in a line that snaked through the beautiful manicured MacKenzie-Childs grounds in search of discounted deals during the annual barn sale. Vendors walked up and down the line offering fancy mixed drinks to cool down the crowd. Shoppers entered 150 at a time every 15 minutes. Once inside another line of nearly a half hour greeted shoppers looking for a shopping cart. Seemingly endless stock was packed on shelves, and tucked into boxes on pallets. Employees worked continually replenishing shelves from the back.
gusset and also demand that you stride into rooms saying things like, ‘Cinders, you shall go to the ball!’). Now that the weather has turned from interminable drizzle to something that can properly be described as cold, I have become impossibly excited about winter clothes. But, like everyone else, from home-buyers to hedgies, I’m not much in the mood for buying. I discovered last Saturday when I had an hour to myself and an urge to splurge, is to go for a spot of wardrobe therapy.
President Obama once again brought up the issue of gays in the military during his annual State of the Union address. Last year, he called for repeal of the federal law barring openly gay people from serving. This year, just a month after having signed a bill to repeal that law, the president urged universities which have barred military recruiters over the gay ban now allow recruiters back on campus. "Our troops come from every corner of this country  they are black, white, Latino, Asian and Native American. They are Christian and Hindu, Jewish and Muslim.
The politicians and government types who howl the loudest, who deny that they cooperated or protest that they were misquoted, they never sue. NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Of course I’ll buy the book, just as will hundreds of thousands of others, probably more than a million. In fact I will probably have finished reading it by the time you read these words, provided I can find a bookstore before returning home. The book was a best-seller, guaranteed, at first word that he had written it. The book is Fear: Trump in the White House.

One-time Yankees killer Dallas Keuchel is entertaining the idea of donning pinstripes. So much so the free agent pitcher is willing to shave his signature beard in order to abide with team protocol. "I think everybody is in play right now," Keuchel said in a recent interview with Fox Business. "The lure of the city would be really cool. I like pitching in Yankee Stadium. "For the right opportunity, I would happily shave this beard off," Keuchel said, channeling his inner-Johhny Damon who did so in 2005. "It's all about winning.
Ian Lafrenière, a newly elected CAQ MNA and former spokesperson for the Montreal police, said it will be tough to fulfil a promise to increase the minimum age from 18 to 21 before marijuana becomes legal in two weeks, but it will happen eventually.

The postponement is meant to allow mortgage lenders time to standardise lending guidelines, said a source in the banking industry who requested anonymity. "Enforcement on Jan 1 is too soon," the source said. Lenders also want the central bank to clarify if the measure applies to multiple mortgages or homes owned, the source said.

Lindsey Buckingham is gunning for something with his brand new touring plans. Earlier this year, the longstanding member of Fleetwood Mac was fired from the band he helped to rise to cultural and artistic prominence, and while Buckingham hasn't spoken out much about the job termination, his newfound solo tour suggests he might be looking to stick it to the band for leaving him behind. Indeed, Buckingham announced that he is going on tour this fall, and he'll begin his own tour just a mere four days after Fleetwood Mac begins its own fall tour in early October.
CELTIC'S Victor Wanyama insists he is going nowhere during the January transfer window.

Jeff Bezos does not believe in the term “work-life balance,” labeling it a “debilitating phrase,” as cited in Business Insider. According to Bezos, the underpinning of the term “work-life balance” assumes a tradeoff. Bezos, instead, likens the relationship between the two to a circle. When you’re happier at home, you perform better at work; when you’re happy at work, you’re more present at home. The problem is most employees today don’t feel in control to be able to implement the “circle” framework proposed by Bezos.

LOS ANGELES - Rafael Montero is earning back some trust. The one-time top Mets prospect had seemingly blown through his opportunities when he was sent down earlier this season with an 8.25 ERA, but with injuries taking their toll once again on the pitching staff, he's been given another chance. And he has impressed - somewhat. In his last two outings, both mop-up assignments, Montero has allowed one run over 6.2 innings pitched.

When design publication I.D. magazine shuttered last month, we hoped it was the last of the bad news we’d be hearing from its publisher, F+W Media. Unfortunately, in a move that metaphorically stands for everything that happened in 2009, F+W, has let go the editor-in-chief of one of their other design publications, Print magazine. We received a tip about Emily Gordon’s departure moments ago, only to have it confirmed by Gordon’s own Twitter feed. After over a year of speculating this exact question, we can now quite literally ask: will this be the death of Print?

Shazam! director David F. Sandberg has offered a behind the scenes look at his cameo as one of the Crocodile Men. The DC Extended Universe film has quickly become a success, earning strong reviews and more than doubling its budget at the global box office so far. Unsurprisingly, Warner Bros. has already gotten the ball rolling on the sequel, which will build on the first movie's mid-credits introduction to the villainous caterpillar, Mister Mind. Shazam! writer Henry Gayden is currently working on the followup, with Sandberg expected to officially sign on as director any day now.
BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) That sinking feeling none of us want to experience -- multiple homes and businesses trying to get their stuff back from thieves. Over the last couple of weeks -- snowmobiles, trailers, and a boat were stolen from at least four businesses in Chittenden and Franklin Counties. Bolton, Essex, Williston, Milton, and Swanton also got hit. Even though police are not saying if these are all connected the people impacted in these towns are working together. "There's a lot of eyes out there," said Michael Seguin, of Bolton.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Israeli government said on Tuesday it had abandoned a plan to forcibly deport African migrants who entered the country illegally after failing to find a willing country to take in the migrants. The government had been working for months on an arrangement to expel thousands of mostly Eritrean and Sudanese men who crossed into Israel through Egypt’s Sinai desert. “At this stage, the possibility of carrying out an unwilling deportation to a third country is not on the agenda,” the government wrote in a response to Israel’s Supreme Court, which has been examining the case.

As predicted President Talabani rejected a controversial elections law. This will likely delay provincial elections until next year. Today’s light violence was marked by a significant amount of arrests, particularly in Babel province. Overall, at least seven Iraqis were killed and five more were wounded. Also, $3 billion has been set aside to rebuild Baghdad. President Jalal Talabani rejected an elections law that was passed yesterday despite a boycott by Kurdish and other lawmakers. At heart is the power structure of multi-ethnic Kirkuk province. Talabani blamed a lack of consensus among parliament’s ethnic factions for the rejection.

In tiny, once peaceful villages, aftershocks are jarring Italians, who are laying out their dead after a massive earthquake—Italy’s worst in 30 years—killed at least 150 people and left tens of thousands more homeless. Many are angry that they weren’t warned of the possibility of the deadly quake, which the Italian government says could not have been predicted. Some villagers have felt tremors in last few weeks: “And that isn’t normal,” said Virgilio Collajani, a resident of Onna, a town near the quake’s epicenter. “This is a seismic area, sure.
California is one of three states that ban compensation for women who donate their eggs to science. Assemblywoman Susan Bonilla says that dissuades women from making the donations, which negatively affects research on a variety of subjects. “We have been unable to advance research in California on how to best freeze eggs which can help young victims of cancer who will be put into early menopause by chemotherapy,” Bonilla said. Bonilla says research on fertility treatments has also stalled. The bill drew opposition from prop-life groups, but it angered some pro-choice organizations as well.

With the introduction of a mainstream partner billing option for Office 365, Microsoft overcame the biggest partner objection to its cloud productivity suite. Now happier partners are rethinking their sales approaches. Windows 8 has taken the lion's share of the spotlight, but Windows RT still has big implications for Microsoft partners. A crowded field of IaaS providers that includes heavyweights Google, Amazon and HP will give Microsoft's new and improved public cloud a run for its money. As Microsoft moves ever closer to a subscription-based model, connecting with the right salesperson isn't just strategy -- it's key.
One of Bill Clinton's last acts as president was to appoint yet another advisory organization on security; the National Infrastructure Assurance Council (NIAC). This brings to mind the old joke about how a politician deals with a problem he doesn't want to deal with, appoint a "Blue Ribbon Panel" (composed of blue blood worthies) to study the problem to death, or at least put it into a black hole where the media will lose interest. The Blue Ribbon Panel is now competing with outfits like the NIAC, which say much, mean little and are generally ignored.
JACKSON, Wyo. --- With the municipal budget pinched by continued declines in sales tax revenues, leaders in Jackson are talking about potential regulations to limit new banks, art galleries and real estate shops at ground-floor locations in the town's prime shopping area. Real estate offices and banks do not collect sales taxes. Galleries do—but there's a loophole, in that if the piece of art is shipped to another location, the local tax can sometimes be avoided. Gallery owners polled by the Jackson Hole News&Guide disagree. One gallery owner reported collecting $40,000 in sales taxes last year.

Authorities in California are sharing one woman’s terrifying footage of her escape from the Woolsey Fire in Malibu – hoping it will serve as a lesson to others about heeding evacuation warnings. Rebecca Hackett posted the Instagram video of her escape from the fire on Friday. “I felt the strongest wind I ever felt in my life. The fire came so quickly. One minute it was calm and then suddenly they were on top of us, so we had to evacuate,” she told ABC30 in Fresno. “I drove through flames for about two minutes.
Much of the talk around the “internet of things” is centered on sensors and the networking or connectivity part of the puzzle — the IP addresses that everyday objects will need to have, or the machine-to-machine (M2M) networks needed to connect all those sensors. But infrastructure isn’t the end of the story. There’s another element to this new wave of technology, namely the software ecosystem that will emerge on top of that infrastructure. And a fundamental building block for that will be identity management — not for the users’ identities, but for the things themselves.
McDonald’s jumped 5.3 percent after the world’s biggest fast-food chain by revenue topped analysts’ forecasts for profit and sales.

The Hellcat engine is Dodge’s gift to muscle car enthusiasts and speed junkies everywhere. The Hellcat-powered variants of the Challenger and the Charger stand out as the most powerful models in their respective segment by a long shot, but Dodge explains they nearly landed with markedly less power. Chris Cowland, Fiat-Chrysler’s director of advanced and SRT powertrain development, began toying with the idea of building a 600-horsepower engine to power Dodge’s muscle car duo a couple of years ago. He presented his idea to the company’s top management, including head honcho Sergio Marchionne, and quickly received the proverbial nod of approval.

Some of the practices that kept premiums for the young low are no longer allowed. The federal health care law could nearly triple premiums for some young and healthy men, according to a forthcoming survey of insurers that singles out a group that might become a major public opinion battleground in the Obamacare wars. The survey, fielded by the conservative American Action Forum and made available to POLITICO, found that if the law’s insurance rules were in force, the premium for a relatively bare-bones policy for a 27-year-old male nonsmoker on the individual market would be nearly 190 percent higher.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Mike Conley and the Memphis Grizzlies gave the Los Angeles Clippers a taste of how tough they can be on defense. The Grizzlies held Los Angeles to 34 percent shooting, caused 19 turnovers and limited the Clippers to a season-low in points in a 96-86 win Wednesday night. "That's been the answer for years for us," Conley said of the defense.

I could dedicate a 20-page ode to her ability to stay neutral while still inciting conflict, but that's not what I'm going to do tonight (mainly because I have it on good authority that 20-page odes do not for an invested readership make). Instead I want to talk about Kyle's quest to keep her youngest daughter, Portia, from becoming spoiled. Look, this is tricky. You never want to be that person calling out another mom for how they're raising their kids.
Cats missing - looking for some hope. My cat has been missing for a week now, if he doesn't come home tonight. He is 7 years old and neutered but not microchipped. We have been out every night looking for him, have put posters up, leaflets through doors, put him on every site/social media page we can think of. I just don't know what else to do. Cats have gone missing for more than a week. Hopefully, he's somewhere safe but he could have got himself shut in a garden shed while he was sheltering from the windy weather a week or so ago.
A woman was so upset when she saw a photo of herself at a wedding that she made a promise to herself that she wouldn't be 23 stone at her own. Now, with the big day looming, self-proclaimed secret-eater Ria Wylie has shifted an impressive eight stone. The 35-year-old, who has been with her partner for 14 years, says she started to pile on the pounds when she began working at a casino. "As a child I loved sports and dancing, but I also loved food," the mother-of-one said.
John Coleman hopes Accrington can maintain their unbeaten run when they face Cambridge United tonight. The Stanley manager has seen his side go 10 games without tasting defeat going into the rescheduled Sky Bet League Two clash at the Wham Stadium. He is optimistic the confidence gained from such a run will be enough to get them through against United. “I just wish the season had started 10 games ago as the last 10 games have been championship-winning form,” said Coleman to Accrington’s official club website. “It can change quickly – you only have to look at Cambridge.
Many of the early success stories with Big Data came from logistics companies. For example, UPS used sensor data to improve maintenance and fuel efficiency back in 2010. In 2011, CIO.com ran a story about U.S. Xpress, which used Big Data and sensors to save about $6 million a year across its fleet. So it really shouldn’t be surprising that an intriguing new Big Data business intelligence platform would be unveiled at a recent American Trucking Associations’ executive summit. Data mining software vendor Vigillo introduced the new solution, which is called Athena after the Greek goddess of wisdom.
Lockport High School students are about evenly divided over the wisdom of a new rule that bars excessive truants from extracurricular activities. At least, that's how a random sampling of students responded when queried at the Lockport Mall on their holiday break this week. The new policy, adopted by the Lockport School Board on Dec. 13, requires students to attend class at least 90 percent of the time in order to be eligible to take part in school clubs, sports teams, musical and dramatic performances, field trips and school dances. The Senior Prom was excluded from the policy.
VCE's outspoken president said he is willing to make a friendly wager that when EMC and Dell officially merge, Microsoft will be looked after. Since Dell announced it was purchasing storage firm EMC for $67 billion in October, Chad Sakac, president of VCE, EMC's Converged Platforms Division, and the leader of EMC Global Systems Engineering, has been asked a lot of questions about how the joint entity will operate on a business-to-business level. Speaking in Sydney on Tuesday, Sakac said that historically EMC and Microsoft have not aligned eye to eye with their point of view of the world.
Several advertisers have made account changes. The American Stock Exchange in New York named the Martin Agency in Richmond to handle its national account, which had been handled for three years by Merkley Newman Harty in New York, a unit of Omnicom Group. Billings were estimated at $8 million to $10 million. Martin, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, got the account after a six-month review had been narrowed to that agency and two other finalists: Hill, Holliday/Altschiller in New York, part of Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, and Mullen Advertising in Wenham, Mass.

Artist's impression of a SpaceX rocket landing. This Sunday, SpaceX will make a second attempt at a historic rocket landing on a floating platform in the ocean. A 22-story-tall Falcon 9 rocket will lift off out of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida a couple of minutes after sunset, at 6:10 ET. And within a half hour or so after take-off, the rocket will return from space and attempt to guide its way, using GPS tracking, onto a droneship in the Atlantic. Five years ago, a landing attempt like this was unheard of.
Keeping cyber thieves at bay is hard. They are busy, well-motivated and well-financed. Just one example serves to show just how prolific they are. Every day, come rain or shine, they crank out about 250,000 novel variants of viruses. Their vigour has helped them steal data from some really big companies, Target, Home Depot and eBay, in the last few months. And, what is a problem for the big companies is even more acute for the smaller firms. They have an even tougher time keeping the bad guys out.
Thomas W. Fawell, a critic of York Township government, is resigning from the Township Board. Fawell said Tuesday he would send a letter of resignation to Township Supervisor John O`Brien, effective upon receipt. Fawell is an Oak Brook lawyer and a member of a politically active family in Du Page County. His father, Thomas, is chairman of the Du Page Airport Authority. The younger Fawell has been criticized for a spotty attendance record at Township Board meetings. At a board meeting this summer, a Lombard woman called for Fawell to resign over that issue.

Over a month after Facebook said it would launch a digital library of political advertisements in India, Google has announced it will do the same. The tech giants seem to be seeking tighter control over political advertising on their respective platforms as India approaches its next general election, expected this spring. Google claimed the India-based ad database, as well as a report on political advertising transparency, would go live in March, The Economic Times reported. The database will provide information on who is purchasing election advertisements on Google’s platforms, and how much money they are spending.
The singularity – or, to give it its proper title, the technological singularity. It's an idea that has taken on a life of its own; more of a life, I suspect, than what it predicts ever will. It's a Thing for techno-utopians: wealthy middle-aged men who regard the singularity as their best chance of immortality. They are Singularitarians, some seemingly prepared to go to extremes to stay alive for long enough to benefit from a benevolent super-artificial intelligence – a man-made god that grants transcendence. And it's a thing for the doomsayers, the techno-dystopians.
Nia Long – actor and part-time hip-hop muse – opened up about sustaining success as a fortysomething black woman in Hollywood to host Larry King in an interview on the broadcaster’s web series, Larry King Now.

It's no secret Ferraris are renowned for their ability to drive women crazy. Unfortunately, a Portland dealership full of them drove one woman so insane she used her green Honda to punch a few holes in the showroom this morning. The police apprehended the woman who used her Honda to destroy the facade of Ron Tonkin Gran Turismo at a gas station and found the woman to be "incoherent," No reason was given for why she targeted this particular dealership, though she initially resisted arrest and is apparently in the hospital being evaluated.
The bedroom with Farrow and Ball's Hague Blue on the wall behind the bed. Jackie Cahoon always looked forward to escaping the pace of London living and heading to her sister’s house in North Yorkshire. Jackie loved the stone-built house the moment she saw the pretty, flower filled garden at the front and the private, sunny courtyard at the back. It was the perfect size, with a second bedroom for her young daughter and visiting friends and family and a light, open plan ground floor stretching front to back. The new kitchen with shelves instead of wall cupboards.
Identify a problem (need) in terms of functional limitation or environmental barrier, and also identify intended target audience for solution. Identify this project's specific context for both problem and solution. Focusing on market failure and taking a purely economic approach falls short of obligations. In this survey, almost one third of respondents incorrectly defined demand led research as researchers consulting beneficiaries or other stakeholders on researcher-defined problems. The other third of participants generally described demand-led research as a problem-based process without acknowledging the group in need. Different groups express different priorities and language used by researchers tells much about their perspective on problems.
Americans and Brits are especially fascinated by the lota. We miss many things when we’re living away from home – mangoes, bun kebabs, paan, the dust, the loadshedding. Okay, okay, just kidding! We miss some of these things, but we manage without them, one way or another. There you go. Beautiful? Yes, he was talking about the brass lota that the village women clean and polish with tamarind and ash each day, turning the ‘brass into gold’. They are beautiful… and very heavy.

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis said that in 2017 the entire output for Colorado was over $342 billion. Emily Haggstrom, from the anti-Proposition 112 forces (Daily Camera, Sept. 22), claims that if 112 is passed that it will cost Colorado’s economy $218 billion dollars and toss 147,000 Coloradans out of work. How she came up with these huge numbers she doesn’t say. The Statistical Atlas breaks down the Colorado civilian employed population aged 16 or older and puts the Oil, Gas and Mining industry with an employment of 35,600, (17th out of 20 industries).

A short-lived tornado developed northwest of Amarillo, Texas, on May 18, 2010. The average tornado warning is sounded 13 minutes before touchdown. Because the warnings don't provide much time, residents in the path of a tornado are advised against evacuating and urged to seek low-lying ground. If warning times could be improved to 40 minutes, Wurman said, residents could make better choices about the risk. Six vehicles had 45 seconds to drive into the storm, drop data-gathering "tornado pods" and get out of the tornado's path. The timing was critical, and panic was the enemy.

Katharine McPhee was let go from her RCA recording contract last year, but that experience didn’t leave her broken. Instead, it fueled her career and brought her to the attention of David Foster. McPhee’s sophomore release, appropriately titled “Unbroken,” was released last week. The singer is currently on the roster of Verve Forecast Records, a division of Universal Music Group. McPhee became a household name on Season 5 of “American Idol.” Week by week she improved her style, but her vocals set her apart. She was definitely meant to be a singer.

A last-gasp Brett Williams penalty lifted Aldershot out of the relegation zone with a draw at Macclesfield. The hosts had the best chance of the first half, but keeper Glenn Morris was equal to Scott Boden's effort.

Hundreds of Syrians suspected of involvement in anti-army attacks have been swept up, as refugees call raids 'unjust'. Ersal, Lebanon - To Kasem al-Zein, last Thursday was one of his worst days on the job. Amid a Lebanese army raid on Sept. 25, the 50-year-old former field doctor with the Free Syrian Army (FSA), who now runs a hospital in Arsal, recalled chaos inside local tent villages housing throngs of Syrian refugees.

The Joel Martin Quintet touched down at Lucy's 51 in Toluca Lake recently with their loose, pleasurable jazz, but they were nearly upstaged by an energetic group of a cappella upstarts. The crowd is normally too loud and tipsy by 11 p.m. to appreciate any genre of music, much less jazz, but the majority stood at attention for a vocals-only sextet called Simply Put. Wedged in between two languid yet listenable sets by Joel Martin's elastic ensemble, the ragtag crooners made old standards new again. Some kind of poetic conjunction will occur when jazz singer Diane Hubka performs a recital at Pasadena Presbyterian Church Saturday.
LeBron James was so inspired by the women who raised him that he created a sneaker for Nike in their honor, Vogue reports. He revealed the HFR x LeBron 16, his first-ever women’s basketball shoe, in collaboration with Nike and Harlem’s Fashion Row.

"The United States imprisons more than any nation in the world." By Eric Stirgus on Monday, May 7th, 2012 at 6:00 a.m. The U.S.A. Land of the free and the home of the imprisoned? U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson says the United States puts a lot of people in prison. "Mister Speaker, the United States imprisons more than any nation in the world," the liberal Democrat from DeKalb County said one day in the House of Representatives.

The game’s buzz looked like an opportunity for a couple of guys who wanted to “show off Sacramento” by luring people to midtown.
There is an urgent need of a get-together of all partners involved in the administration of Maltese sport. It should serve as an opportunity to discuss a number of important topics, review the current situation and offer solutions for accepted common problems. The conclusions will serve as a sound basis for the implementation of a serious action plan, which should cover short and long term policies. Though a number of seminars are regularly organised by different groups, it would be a historical and fruitful occasion, the first of its kind with all players involved in a soul searching exercise expected to give their valid contributions.
In a public outburst against Akhilesh Yadav, Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav today said his son had insulted him and the voters understood that "one who is not loyal to his father, cannot be loyal to anyone" which led to the party's poll debacle. He also said that a final view on floating a new party is yet to be taken.

Why do CEOs need extravagant perks even when they are firing staff and pleading for taxpayer bailouts? It may just be in their makeup, experts say. It takes arrogance and narcissism to become leader of a Fortune 500 company. Those same traits, however, have become their undoing during the deepest recession in decades. U.S. President Barack Obama has noticed, telling reporters on Thursday he was outraged by a New York State report that $18.4 billion in Wall Street bonuses were paid in 2008 as taxpayers rescued the crumbling financial system. "That is the height of irresponsibility.

GREENSBORO – The moan that escapes the Devils’ deadline acquisition is one of knowing what’s coming. But entering last night against the Hurricanes here, it had been seven games without tasting defeat as a Devil for Nemchinov. It was also the longest current unbeaten streak in the NHL. The passing of the trade deadline, and all the jitters it engenders, can be suspected of having some positive influence on the Devils. Many players had heard their names in rumors, in deals that went unconsummated. But Nemchinov has not simply been a last-minute passenger on this 4-0-3 ride.
DP World of Dubai has agreed to manage the Somaliland Port of Berbera in a landmark deal this month that opens a new point of access to the Red Sea and gives the global ports operator an alternative hub to Djibouti in the Horn of Africa.

DP World said Sunday that it agreed to the port-management deal earlier this month in Dubai.
Hey Phil! I hope you're finding the office to be to your liking. You can find color-coded post-its in the closet down the hall. Different colored highlighters, too. But before you head down to get those, can we have a word about the defense? The Bears defense is what the team is known for. Five defensive players were named to the Pro Bow this season, and it's obviously where the team has invested its money. However, the defense is far from perfect. Find linebackers to develop.

A new look at old problems will generate solutions. Businesses, especially white collar businesses, are all about "processes and information" (thank you Michael Dortch). But what do you do when you find yourself looking at the same processes and the same information and can't improve your results? Try looking at things in a new way, graphically, using tools such as MindManager or TheBrain.

MINNEAPOLIS - It was the summer of 2002, and shortstops ruled the world. Joe Torre, who managed the New York Yankees at the time and was in charge of picking the American League reserves for that summer's All-Star game, looked at a new breed of big, power-hitting shortstop that was revolutionizing the position and couldn't seem to choose one over the other. So he chose them all. Texas Rangers star Alex Rodriguez was voted a starter by the fans, and Torre added Derek Jeter, Oakland's Miguel Tejada and Boston's Nomar Garciaparra to the roster.
Former glories... How Ford looked as Indiana last time around. BBC1 scored an Indiana Jones hat trick last night, seeing off ITV1 for the third week in a row with the final instalment of the movie trilogy. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, in which Sean Connery plays the father of Harrison Ford's intrepid archaeologist, had 10m viewers and a 40% audience share between 8pm and 9.50pm last night. Last week the Temple of Doom also drew 10m viewers, while a fortnight ago Raiders of the Lost Ark pulled in 8.8m.
He had his flaws but the former PM and his government look better all the time. Monday marks a notable date in political history – the anniversary of April 9 1992, the last time that the Conservative Party managed to achieve victory at a general election. Right up to the BBC exit polls, it was assumed that Neil Kinnock’s Labour would win. But John Major, always underestimated by a sneering metropolitan media class, triumphed against the odds. He won more votes – 14 million – than any other British prime minister has ever done.
The "Hand in Hand" telethon will originate from Los Angeles but also will feature stages in New York and Nashville, Tennessee. Beyonce, Barbra Streisand, Oprah Winfrey, Drake, Leonardo DiCaprio and Justin Timberlake are among the stars scheduled to participate. NEW YORK — A one-hour hurricane relief benefit originally intended to help Texas victims of Harvey but expanded to help people affected by Irma, is set to air across more than a dozen television networks on Tuesday. ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, HBO, MTV, BET and Univision are among the networks carrying the telethon.
I'm thinking they should just maybe now move on to the next Dr. ! The problem here is that Brauchler is not securing this testimony to object to her testifying as an expert. He's doing it to undermine the weight of her opinions before she even testifies. This is problematic. And another beat down on the DT. AC not even taking names on this one. How many times will King object on relevance, beyond the scope? The more they he objects the worse he makes himself look. Uh ohhhhhh..... Big nail this time. Well, that was a surprise!
[ Academia ] as a Related Elective for those interested in Immigration Law : An important area of public interest law involves practice with or before federal agencies. Whether a PI lawyer works on behalf of an agency or represents a client suing the agency, it is important to know what and how the agency regulates, and how lawyers can most effectively interact with the agency. In addition to taking the overview course, Administrative Law, students should take a course that examines a particular agency’s role and procedures, and considers the specific application of the doctrines of administrative law to that agency.
Although he’s applied for jobs, 22-year-old Yousefi has faced challenges common among refugees when seeking work: a language barrier and no local work experience or references. He’s just started a part-time job with tea company Chaigaram, which provides employment to refugees and aims to help them better integrate into the UK. Yousefi is one of an estimated 118,995 refugees living in the UK, many of whom face extreme difficulties in finding a job, never mind returning to their previous professions. But businesses and social enterprises like Chaigaram are trying to change this.

The band were performing at Fort Canning Park on Friday (April 30) when a fan hurled a flip-flop at Jones‘ face, who halted their performance to pick up the object. The singer then muttered “thank you” to the crowd before tossing the shoe aside and walking off stage with his bandmates. Security guards hauled the man responsible outside, before Jones and his bandmates returned to the stage to finish their set, reports Yahoo News.

2015 NBA Power Rankings: Who's on Top Heading into Playoffs? No, Jim Mora. We're not kidding you. We, too, are excited for the NBA playoffs. After five-and-a-half months of back-to-backs, TNT Thursday nights and countless hours debating who's better and who's best, it's finally time to let the players and coaches decide a true champion. To be sure, you'll hear no complaints from me about the season that was. The 2014-15 campaign was arguably the most exciting and intriguing one the Association has seen in some time.
England's main obstacle to a place in the World Cup final is a player who is adored by football fans around the world, but is a controversial figure in his native Croatia. For Luka Modric, a year of success on the football field has contrasted dramatically with chaos off the pitch as the Real Madrid star has become mired in a corruption case back at home which traces back to his departure from Dinamo Zagreb for Tottenham back in 2008. Former Zagreb chief executive Zdravko Mamic also worked as an agent and he was found guilty of siphoning off funds from the sale of stars such as Modric and Dejan Lovren.
Meeting women used to be a real challenge for me. I’m not the most outgoing guy, and chatting up a perfect stranger has never exactly been my strong suit. But that’s all changed now. You see, I’ve always loved cats for their easy companionship, but I wish I had gotten one sooner, because they come with a fantastic added benefit: They’re the best way to get to know women who magically appear in your living room. It used to be that when an attractive woman materialized in my apartment, I’d clam up completely.
A car rolled over and crashed into a Windsor creek, killing one. One woman has died after a car rolled over into a creek Thursday evening. Broome County Sheriff's Office responded to Seward Road in the Town of Windsor just before 7 p.m. where a 2005 Chevrolet Impala had come to rest in a roadside creek. Deputies said the vehicle, driven by Cindy Rowe, 54, of Harpursville, had been traveling south on the road when it left the roadway, rolled over and landed in the creek. CPR was performed, but Rowe was declared dead at the scene.
Here now is another way to indulge. Say hello to Java Jewels. They are necklaces and bracelets made of coffee beans. Greg Anderson of Santa Monica, Calif., says the idea started when his brother James took a trip to Costa Rica and came upon a man on the side of a road selling strings of coffee beans. Back home, working with another brother, Steve , who is in the coffee-roasting business, he found chemicals that would seal and strengthen the beans. The three brothers then tested them on surfers to be sure they would not bleed on clothes.
Lockheed Martin F-16s from the Royal Danish Air Force have for the first time dropped weapons on Libya, the service has confirmed. A detachment of six Danish F-16s touched down at Sigonella air base in Sicily on 19 March, two days after the UN security council had passed resolution 1973 approving the introduction of measures against the Libyan state, including the imposition of a no-fly zone. In an operational update released on 23 March, the Royal Danish Air Force said its aircraft have so far flown 12 sorties in support of the US-led Operation "Odyssey Dawn".
The feel-good factor generated by Wellington Phoenix has captured fans in Auckland and could result in their largest home crowd for an A-League regular season match. A return to Eden Park for Friday's game against Melbourne Victory was initially considered a financial risk but tickets have been snapped up, with club officials hopeful they can surpass a crowd of 20,000. General manager David Dome had set an attendance target of 15,000 but that looks like being comfortably surpassed, with tickets for extra bays being made available at New Zealand's biggest sports venue on Wednesday. The most substantial Wellington A-League home crowds came during the 2009-10 finals.
The waves of change are rolling in high and fast in the world of professional big wave surfing. After months of community debate and behind the scenes struggles, the World Surfing League has reportedly decided to give equal top prize money to men and women surfers in its events, which includes the Bay Area’s Mavericks competition. The Committee for Equality in Women’s Surfing (CEWS), intensified its fight after a plan was proposed in July offering $25,000 for the top male surfer and $15,000 for the female winner.
The Savannah National Wildlife Refuge will host the Savannah NWR Spring Fling on Saturday from 10 a.m until 4 p.m. at the new refuge headquarters building on U.S. Highway 17 across the Talmadge Bridge. This first-time event is planned for the entire family and offers activities and education for young and old. Activities include archery, animal Olympics, hands on wildfire equipment demonstration, face painting, a presentation on the refuge hunt program, the refuge role in protecting endangered species, water management as it pertains to wildlife and bird banding are all a part of the one day program.
We first wrote about a service called 1000memories back in July 2010. The site was setting out to address a topic that people don’t like to talk about, but is universal all the same: when people pass away, their friends and family members like to remember them and celebrate their memories. That can be difficult though — these people are often separated by great distances, and it’s hard to share antique photos with a lot of people. So 1000memories created a service for digital memorials, where all of these friends and family members can upload their photos and share their favorite memories in a single place.
Could the rumored Amazon smartphone also have a Mayday button? Amazon bragged Friday that its Mayday tech support button on the Fire HDX tablet has become the most popular way to get 24/7 tech help, with an average response time of just 9.75 seconds. When the Mayday button was announced with the Fire HDX eight months ago, Amazon said its response time goal was 15 seconds or less. Amazon Customer Service Director Scott Brown said in a statement that the Mayday concept is working well and has helped revolutionize tech support. About 75% of customer contacts regarding the Fire HDX come via the Mayday button to get a tech response.

A training session for Lincolnshire Chalk Stream volunteers of all ages held in Donington on Bain showed those attending the importance of the riverfly. Training was provided by the Riverfly Partnership which aims to protect the water quality of rivers and actively conserve riverfly habitats. Volunteers were taught how to survey for riverflies on the county’s chalk streams, including the River Bain and all information recorded will be fed into a national data base. The training and all equipment required was funded by grant funding from WREN, a not for profit organisation which awards grants to community projects from funds donated by FCC Environment through the Landfill Communities Fund.
Boyd Buchanan Lacrosse program has added to its senior coaching staff with the addition of Pat Wagner. Mr. Wagner and Chris Richardson will coach the high school Lacrosse team, with assistant coach Steve Frost. Boyd Buchanan Lacrosse began in the middle school with Chris Richardson as head coach. He led the team to three winning seasons from 2016 to 2018. In 2015, Mr. Wagner began his Lacrosse coaching career at Evangelical Christian School. He led the middle school team to a winning record of 12-5 in 2015. He became head coach of the high school in 2016 and won two consecutive state championships (2016 and 2017).
He made a pee-line for the door. A mailman was caught on surveillance video urinating while making a postal delivery at a Tennessee home. The Memphis homeowner shared the footage on Facebook, which shows postal worker releasing a trail of urine as he walks on the porch of the house in the neighborhood of Berclair. The mailman can be seen looking around to check if anyone noticed his dirty deed and continuing to deliver the mail — with the same hand seemingly used to touch his private parts. After delivering the mail, he walks back toward the street, careful to steer clear of the wet evidence.
A new bill requiring the New York City Police Department to study how it could take a more standardized approach to disciplining officers is slated to be introduced in the city council Thursday. The bill will call for the NYPD to research adopting a “disciplinary matrix,” a process used by some police departments to help ensure officers found guilty of misconduct are penalized in a consistent way. Earlier this year, BuzzFeed News published an investigation into how the NYPD disciplines its officers and found dozens were kept on the force even after they lied, cheated, stole, or assaulted New York City residents.
Rapper Kanye West unveiled his new collection of clothes and music on Thursday at Madison Square Garden. Dubbed "Yeezy Season 3" after his line for Adidas, the event saw the polarizing artist coupling his twin passions. Always one for a grand gesture, West also announced that he is at work on a video game called "Only One" and that it's about his late mother "traveling through the gates of heaven." Broadcast live on the Tidal music streaming service — at least when the feed wasn't crashing — the presentation delivered pomp and beats in equal measure.
Tabitha explains things to Julian, Sheridan poisons Theresa, the blackmailer makes some confessions to Eve. Tabitha, Julian and Endora return home, no matter how hellish and happy it is. He can barely believe that he's fathered a supernatural child, but Tabs tells him that their daughter is very gifted for a girl her age. He has lots of questions. 'A father should know everything about his children,' he says. No wonder Tabitha was so reluctant to send her to pre-school. 'It's like an episode of Bewitched and I'm Darren,' he smiles.
President Donald Trump walks down the steps of Air Force One at Minneapolis-Saint Paul Air Reserve Station in Minneapolis, Monday, April 15, 2019. Top administration officials have been discussing ways to increase pressure on countries with high numbers of citizens who overstay short-term visas, as part of President Donald Trump's growing focus on immigration heading into his re-election campaign. The administration could introduce new travel restrictions on nationals from those countries, according to two people familiar with the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose private conversations.
The White House is resisting lawmakers’ plans to renew the Iran Sanctions Act. Behind the showdown between President Barack Obama and Congress over the Iran nuclear deal is a second dispute that could cost the White House allies it needs to ensure the agreement survives: Whether and when to renew a key law that imposes sanctions on Tehran. Under the nuclear deal, Obama would suspend the sanctions imposed by Congress, but the statutes can stay on the books as a safeguard in case Iran reneges and the president needs to “snap” the sanctions back.
The longtime 'Dancing with the Stars' host has some opinions on the format for Season 28 of the ABC celebrity ballroom competition. Tom Bergeron wants Dancing with the Stars to score some more real estate on ABC. The longtime host of the ABC celebrity ballroom competition tweeted a sentiment about the possible revival of the long-gone results show. Bergeron shared an article written by TV historian Marc Berman about network scheduling suggestions for the 2019-20 TV season in which it was proposed that ABC should revive the Tuesday night DWTS results show in a half-hour format, Gold Derby reports.
Arvid Carlsson, a Swedish pharmacologist whose research on chemical signals in the brain resulted in a leading treatment for Parkinson’s disease and earned him a Nobel Prize, died June 29 in Gothenburg, Sweden. He was 95. The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, where Dr. Carlsson had served on the faculty since 1959, confirmed the death but did not give a cause. Dr. Carlsson shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with Paul Greengard and Eric R. Kandel, scientists who independently studied the molecular underpinnings of the brain, in particular the ways neural signals affect memory, mood and movement.
Despite being the company’s first effort to expand beyond fitness tracking, Fitbit’s Ionic smartwatch always felt like it was meant for the gym and little else. Now Fitbit wants to prove that it’s serious about broadening its reach with its upcoming Versa smartwatch, featuring an an all-new look that feels more like a high-end timepiece than a sports watch. The Fitbit Versa is available for preorder now and launches in April for $199.95, making it much less expensive than both the $329 Apple Watch Series 3 and $299.95 Fitbit Ionic.
New York: Satyam Computer Services Ltd asked a judge to let Jones Day replace Wachtell Lipton Rosen and Katz as the law company defending the software services provider against investor lawsuits in the US. Satyam, the company at the center of India’s biggest corporate fraud inquiry, made the request in papers filed on 18 September in federal court in Manhattan by Jayant Tambe, a Jones Day partner. The papers gave no reason for the switch. Wachtell Lipton Partner Warren Stern and Satyam executive vice-chairman Vineet Nayyar signed a consent to the substitution of counsel.

Was Jesus an idiot? God’s response to evil. Something is wrong, terribly wrong with our world. Anders Behring Breivik’s mass killings in Norway were followed by Tan Do’s shooting of 5 family members and himself near Dallas. For me these events have brought 3 questions percolating to the top of my brain. #1 How does God respond to evil people? #2 Was Jesus an idiot? Does he just not understand evil, it’s reality and power? Ok, love your enemies. Jesus is wrong here, isn’t he?
Dear Abby: Please help me with an embarrassing situation I got myself into because of my big mouth. Yesterday, a new neighbor that I have waved to, but never talked to, brought over a package that was addressed to me but delivered to her house by mistake. I invited her in, and we sat in the den and talked a while. Then I asked her to come into the living room so I could show her a beautiful framed picture of my granddaughter. We had to walk through my kitchen to get to the living room.

While Democrats have long had an advantage among African-American voters, GOP nominee Donald Trump is gaining little support among blacks. In several polls released in the first half of August, Trump is earning just 1 percent of the African-American support nationally. This is compared to between 83 to 89 percent for Clinton. In a poll released by Fox News, Clinton is pulling in 85 percent of the vote, while Trump had just 1 percent. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson polled at 7 percent. Another poll, conducted by Marist College, had Clinton with 89 percent of the African-American vote.
Perhaps this is how the “trickle down” theory of economics works. They are a part of the urban landscape — homeless people with shopping carts overflowing with bags of cans and bottles and other discards to be redeemed for cash at recycling centers. West Oakland, a.k.a. Dogtown, is the site of one such center, and Amir Soltani and Chihiro Wimbush’s immersive and wrenching documentary “Dogtown Redemption” (Monday, 10 p.m. on PBS) profiles three of those who depend on it for their marginal livelihoods over a period of seven years.
A fisherman in the Philippines has kept what might be the largest natural pearl ever found hidden in his home for more than 10 years. The enormous pearl is 30cm wide (1ft), 67cm long (2.2ft) and weighs 34kg (75lb). If it is confirmed to have formed within a giant clam, as has been reported, it would likely be valued in excess of US$100m. According a report in the local Palawan News, a man from Puerto Princesa, on Palawan Island, found it more than a decade ago while out fishing.
Is Now the Time to Buy New York Community Bancorp? Could a major dividend cut be looming? And does that even matter over the long term? Over the last three months, New York Community Bancorp's (NYSE:NYCB) stock has been hammered. Here's why, what it means, and my views on whether now is the right time to buy. For years, New York Community Bancorp has intentionally kept its total assets below the key regulatory threshold at $50 billion, waiting to find a suitable acquisition target to leap frog that threshold, and propel the bank into the heightened regulatory landscape.

Consumer DNA testing companies, including 23andMe and MyHeritage, are offering genetic kits as a way to reunite immigrant parents with detained and separated children at the border. Immigrant rights groups are wary of the privacy risks involved for already vulnerable communities. One DNA testing technology, from Thermo Fisher Scientific's Integen X, could alleviate some of the concerns. The fight to reunite immigrant families took a genetic twist this week as tensions increased over detained children. The same consumer DNA testing kits that trace ancestry and offer genetic risk assessments were proposed as a way to reunite families separated at the border.

One of the most powerful volcanoes in Europe could be no longer dormant. Öræfajökull, Iceland’s biggest and most active volcano, is showing signs that it is becoming active after centuries of slumber. Scientists have detected geothermal activity coming from the volcano, leading Icelandic authorities to state that they are no longer certain it is dormant, reported Iceland Magazine. Recent satellite images show that a 1-kilometer-wide “ice cauldron” has formed in the volcano’s caldera, the large cauldron-like depression at the top. Scientists believe the caldera has released geothermal water, which was detected flowing into a nearby glacial river.
The first phase of Dallas' West Love development has opened on Mockingbird Lane. The over $40 million, 224-room Aloft and Element hotels are just west of Dallas' Love Field. The two hotels are in the same building and share 6,500 square feet of meeting space, an outdoor swimming pool and fitness center. The hotel even has a robotic butler system that "assists with small deliveries such as towels, toiletries or even drinks from the bar." The Dallas hotel is only the second Aloft in the country to get the automated delivery drone.
NEW YORK -- James Levine, the Cincinnati-born conductor of New York’s Metropolitan Opera, faces allegations that he sexually abused a man three decades ago beginning when the man was a teenager. The Metropolitan Opera suspended Levine Sunday. The opera said Saturday it would open an investigation into the man's claims. Levine’s accuser, now middle-aged, contacted the police department in Lake Forest, Illinois, in October of 2016 to report that he’d had sexual contact with the conductor when he was under age 18. An email to Levine’s manager seeking comment on the accusations was not immediately returned.
LBC’s managing director, David Lloyd, said: "LBC is the home of entertaining conversation and this repositioning reflects the relationship our growing audience enjoys with LBC’s presenters and programming. Primarily, LBC is a meeting point for Londoners, a place to engage in conversation, life in the capital and create captivating new content on air." LBC saw a 28.9% year-on-year increase in total listening, achieving 7.1 million hours, according to RAJAR figures for Q4 2006. In terms of London listening hours, LBC ranks ahead of Virgin Radio, Choice FM, talkSport, Capital Gold and XFM.
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — As a child, Fred Lincoln “Link” Wray, Jr. hid under a bed when the Ku Klux Klan came to his parent’s home in rural North Carolina. Racist groups often targeted the poor family of Shawnee Native American ancestry as the Wrays endured segregation in the American South just like African-Americans. Wray eventually took all that rage of his early years and crafted a 1958 instrumental hit Rumble using a distinct, distorted electric guitar sound that would influence generations of rock ‘n’ roll musicians from Iggy Pop, Neil Young, Pete Townshend of The Who and Slash of Guns N’ Roses.
Joseph "Chip" Sheppard III serves on the board of New Approach Missouri, which is campaigning to legalize medical marijuana in the state. Citing a hectic schedule, Joseph “Chip” Sheppard III resigned Monday from the board of Ozarks Technical Community College. The Springfield attorney has been heavily involved in a campaign to legalize medical marijuana usage in Missouri. The issue is on the November ballot. Sheppard, elected to the OTC Board of Trustees in April 2014, was expected to serve for nearly two more years.

A small Russian software company learns that Adobe doesn't pull its punches when an engineer is arrested for creating a program to crack the eBook format. Attention, software pirates, security researchers and those out to prove a point: Adobe Systems doesn't pull its punches. That's the lesson Dmitry Sklyarov, a Russian software programmer, learned Monday when FBI agents arrested him in Las Vegas for allegedly publishing a program that removes the security protections from Adobe eBook files. The bureau said such activity was a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
Last Friday, B&T published the annual 100 coolest brands loved by Millennials by US ad agency Moosylvania. Among a number of interesting results, good-old Coca-Cola came in at number five. And it appears it’s not Coke’s signature sugary beverage that’s winning over the Ys, but the brand’s continued branching out into new streams such as water and ready-made coffee and tea drinks. Last week, Coca-Cola Amatil in Australia announced a six months to June profit of $198.2 million, primarily on the back of sales of bottled water, as its fizzy drinks category continued to fizz.

I checked out the Science Fiction + Fantasy Short Film Festival this weekend. This year’s SSFSSF featured some very entertaining. Here are a few of the films I enjoyed. Cockpit: The Rule of Engagement: In the year 2103, mankind is at war with the Tarceds, an alien race that can control minds. Our brave men and women of the U.E.S. Navy hold the enemy at the outer edge of the galaxy. But when a pilot returns mysteriously from a bombing run without his wingman, suspicions of his affliction arise.
I have some news that I thought might interest you for the Search Engine Roundtable. Multiply just launched the first "social search engine" - which finds content published within one's social network and ranks results based on social proximity. It's much different than what Friendster/Eurekster does which, as you know, is to show someone the topics that their friends have searched. Thank you in advance for looking it over. Again, I thought you might find it interesting. Hope you don't mind that I sent it along. Feel free to call or e-mail me if you'd like to discuss it some more.

Teachers of computer courses have long suspected that computers encourage students to work together rather than separately. Researchers say they now have evidence to confirm that suspicion. Marion Perlmutter, professor of child development at the University of Minnesota, says an experiment involving preschool children revealed that children work together more when they use computers than when they work on other projects. After giving 60 3- and 5-year-old students about 30 minutes of instruction in using the keyboard and other features of a computer, researchers at the university's Child Care Center allowed students to use computers during their one and one-half hours of free time.

Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson advises that his successor does not necessarily have to come from the Old Trafford alumni currently learning their trade in the Barclays Premier League. Mark Hughes - in talks with Manchester City about taking over at Eastlands - and Roy Keane, who both won league titles as players under Ferguson, have made impressive starts to their managerial careers but the Scot believes his assistant manager Carlos Queiroz is equally well placed to step into his shoes. "You can't discount them, obviously, but it's not a prerequisite for the job," he said.

A former inmate at HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire has told ITV Central why he believes some inmates make the decision to escape. John "Ben" Gunn spent the last three years of 32 year sentence at the open prison. He said absconding was never something he considered, but there are many reasons why some prisoners walk out. If a man's a drug user, he could run up huge debts and decides to run to avoid his debts. Some people will run, just to try and sort out problems on the domestic front.
AUSTIN, Texas — Texas is an unlikely can’t-miss stop for the Democratic presidential candidates, but many of them are making appearances this weekend at the trendy and techie South by Southwest Festival in Austin. Texas is an early primary state, but the real draw of the event for Democrats is the chance to spend time with the party’s ascendant young and liberal wing. Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman, is expected to attend the premiere of a documentary film chronicling his longshot U.S. Senate campaign last year. It ended in a narrow loss to the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz.

Camera IconHeavy rain meant final-round play was abandoned in Philadelphia. "We've had (more than) three inches of rain since yesterday; we've got a golf course we just couldn't play," US Tour vice president of rules and competition Slugger White said. However, round four tee times are scheduled between 7.30am and 9.20am. "If we don't get to Monday ... then I think that we will be looking at maybe a 54-hole event. "But I'm not going to commit to that right now."
Noa learned to sew from her grandmother. Getting a diagnosis of cancer is a life-changing experience. That’s what Noa Sorrell realized over the past year. The treatment left Noa Sorrell with a lot of time on her hands. Noa learned how to sew from her grandmother, who passed away last year. She always dreamed of becoming a fashion designer and the Make-a-Wish Foundation made it happen. The nonprofit group grants wishes to children with life-threatening illnesses, and they arranged for Noa to show off her clothes during Los Angeles Fashion Week. Noa's collection for Spring 2016.
In 2015, Yale-New Haven Hospital and city community health centers Cornell Scott-Hill Health and Fair Haven Community Health Care first started planning to consolidate primary care at a Long Wharf facility. The New Haven Primary Care Consortium will aim to provide patients with high-quality, coordinated care, according to the Hospital press release. The plans, however, have drawn sharp criticism from the medical community and local advocates, including seven interviewed by the News, who say that the Long Wharf location will not be accessible to low-income, disabled and elderly patients under the current proposal.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., warned Monday, if Democrats focus on an attack strategy against President Donald Trump ahead of the 2020 election, "we lose." In a wide-ranging town hall sponsored by Fox News and held in Bethlehem, Pa. — a state that helped Trump win in 2016 — an energetic and confident Sanders hit some of the hot-button issues likely to be part of his second run at the White House, including political strategy, taxing the rich, and a single-payer healthcare system. "I don't think the American people are proud that we have a president who is a pathological liar," he said.
Lockheed Martin's multimission combat ships. The US government has approved the sale of four Lockheed Martin Corp. multimission warships and associated equipment to Saudi Arabia, a deal valued at $11.25 billion, according to a US government official. The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees foreign military sales, notified US lawmakers late Monday about the possible sale, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Lawmakers have 30 days to block the sale, though such action is rare since potential deals are carefully vetted before any formal notification takes place.
Germany's BND intelligence agency sends enormous amounts of phone and text data to the US National Security Agency (NSA) each month, Die Zeit Online reported, adding yet another layer to the spy scandal embroiling the German government. About a fifth of all metadata gathered by the BND each month, or some 1.3 billion pieces go to the NSA, the websitereportedon Tuesday, citing confidential German intelligence files it obtained. German media earlier revealed that BND was collecting 220 million metadata pieces per day, which amounted to an estimated 6.6 billion a month.
Newswise — An international research team led by Tim Nilsen, Ph.D., a professor of medicine and biochemistry and the director of the School of Medicine's Center for RNA Molecular Biology, has discovered an unexpected mechanism governing alternative splicing, the process by which single genes produce different proteins in different situations. The new mechanism suggests that curing the more than half of genetic diseases that are caused by mutations in the genetic code that in turn create mistakes in alternative splicing may be considerably more complicated than biomedical researchers have previously assumed. Those diseases include a large number of cancers and many neurodegenerative diseases.
This article was first published in April 2004 and was subsequently incorporated as a chapter in the author’s book America’s War on Terrorism. published in 2005. Control of the drug trade was a central objective of the US-NATO led invasion, following the Taliban government’s decision in 2000 to curtail opium production and suppress the trade in heroin, an initiative which was supported by the UN. War and the Trade in Narcotics are intimately related. The Afghan war going back to the late 1970s was covertly financed by the proceeds of the Golden Crescent drug trade.
Dunedin doctors are already seeing the impacts of climate change on patients' health, a Dunedin doctor says. University of Otago Department of Preventive and Social Medicine senior lecturer Alex Macmillan said the city's damp homes and and flood-prone areas were just one reason a climate change declaration reflecting the wants of New Zealanders was needed. A climate change declaration calling on the Government to cease oil exploration, reinstate insulation subsidies for draughty homes and consider climate change when making political decisions would be launched tomorrow. Dr McMillan is co-convener of Ora Taiao, an organisational signatory of the declaration.
America Online now provides specialized environments for kids, all included with regular accounts at no extra cost: AOL KOL for children 12 and under, AOL RED for teens 13 to 15, and AOL RED Plus for 16- and 17-year-olds. Its filter, which uses artificial intelligence, did a very good job in testing. Parents can set controls on up to seven accounts. Each service is customizable and provides content tailored to the intended age group. KOL, for example, offers educational content, flash cartoons, and interactive games. Instant messaging is disabled by default, but kids can access supervised chat rooms.
One of the growth industries triggered by, first, the prospect of, and, now, the impending reality of a separate Telangana state, is media owned by people from the region. Suddenly, it is no longer enough that Andhra Pradesh has far more news channels than any other in the country—some 15, not counting impending and new entrants. What matters is whether the owner belongs to Andhra, or Rayalaseema, or Telangana and whose aspirations the media outlet is striving to represent. At the end of August, Hyderabad got yet another English newspaper called Metro India.

Pat Finucane was murdered in front of his three children and wife in February 1989. Clodagh’s mother Mary Coll and sister Jacqueline Connolly last night spoke on Claire Byrne Live. The Spurs star scored the second goal for his side but their victory was marred by the incident. The club are accused of ‘tapping up’ Silva whilst he was head coach of Watford. Stephen Teap, whose wife was affected by the scandal and has since died, says Varadkar needs to get ahead of the situation. Gsoc has published a scathing report into deficiencies in the investigation files into the priest’s murder.
Elevate combines algorithmic recommendations from LinkedIn Pulse and Newsle, as well as human curation, to suggest content employees could share. Some of the most powerful brand advocates are the ones holding company business cards. LinkedIn wants to harness this, launching a new product — Elevate — that allows companies to curate and share company content, and measure the effectiveness. For example, when a LinkedIn member shares six pieces of content, on average, they receive six profile views and make two new connections, which helps them strengthen their professional brands.
Even as the national debate rages around federal funding of the arts, local organizations find support from cities. The topic of government support of the arts is often controversial. Various sides of the debate have again been argued in recent weeks at the federal level. The Trump administration has proposed drastic cuts to various arts-related programs, including a complete elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts. Yet there is a long history of governmental patronage of the arts. Gudea, a ruler in Mesopotamia from about 2144-2124 BC, is among the early examples of kingly patronage of the arts.
The defense industry is bracing for the fallout from the Trump administration’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Europe, Mexico and Canada. The 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum, which went into effect Friday, are expected to raise costs for the U.S. defense industry, biting into its bottom line. Though U.S. defense firms primarily buy steel and aluminum domestically, the tariffs are likely to lead to increased prices in the U.S., said former Pentagon official Andrew Hunter, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.
Sheffield’s newest KFC restaurant is beginning to take shape with work continuing on a development which will also see a new Costa Coffee built. Plans to build the two units on land just off Richmond Park Road, at the junction with Handsworth Road, Handsworth, were approved by Sheffield Council in January. The KFC restaurant, which will sit nearest Richmond Park Road, will also offer a drive-thru facility and could open from 6am until 3am the following day, as per the conditions imposed by the council. There will also be parking for 25 cars, 14 cycle spaces and four disabled parking bays.
Toshiba's chief executive and president Hisao Tanaka is to resign after the company said it had overstated its profits for the past six years. He will be succeeded by chairman Masashi Muromachi, with vice-chairman Norio Sasaki also stepping down. On Monday, an independent panel appointed by Toshiba said the firm had overstated its operating profit by a total of 151.8bn yen ($NZ1.8bn). The overstatement was roughly triple an initial Toshiba estimate. The finance minister, Taro Aso, said the case could undermine confidence in corporate governance in Japan. He added the accounting irregularities at Toshiba were "very regrettable".
A state lawmaker is looking to stop Iowa’s public colleges and universities from being able to offer tenure to professors or other employees. Officials with the Iowa Board of Regents oppose the bill. The bill would establish “acceptable grounds for termination of employment of any member of the faculty.” The list of possible causes for termination include just cause, program discontinuance and financial exigency. Regent officials expressed opposition to the bill Thursday. "We recognize the concern about merit-based evaluations addressed in the bill, however the Board of Regents understands the role of tenure," Bruce Rastetter, president of the board, said via email.
The blame game as to who is responsible for the defeat of the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) at the just ended polls will not go away anytime soon as more and more persons continue to apportion blames. Latest to join in the fray is the Assin North constituency Chairman, Mr Felix Benefo who said the NDC lost the election primarily because the party was united at the national level but disintegrated at the constituency level. He added that Parliamentary candidates’ abysmal performance also counted for the defeat of President John Dramani Mahama because most of them worked in isolation without recourse to party unity and structures.
SEOUL, South Korea -- Two Israeli yachtsmen sailed at the Games on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar and could be suspended from international competition when they get home. Israel's Olympic Committee President Isaac Ofek said brothers Dan-Noam and Ram-Jacob Torten had sailed their 470 class yacht during the Yom Kippur fast. But he said they had not taken part in a race that was in progress on the same course at the same time. Provisional results of the 470 race in Pusan listed the brothers in ninth place. Official results later dropped them into a tie for last and said they did not finish.
Happy National Pasta month! The holiday, which officially kicked off on Monday, October 1, and spans the entire month, celebrates all varieties of the Italian staple. In other words, it’s all about the carbs for the next few weeks! While there’s nothing wrong with tried and true pasta standbys such as spaghetti and meatballs or fettuccine alfredo, this is also the perfect time to experiment with new flavors and methods of preparing the widely popular food. That’s where Chopped judge Maneet Chauhan comes in.
What is the voltage/amps of 4x AA batteries? I have a device that takes 4x AA batteries and I'd buy a DC adapter so I don't need batteries anymore. Assuming that they're in series, 6v nominally for alkaline, as low as 4.8 for NiMH. Batteries are specced in Amp-Hours, not amps--amperage is a rate, Ah is a quantity indicating the amount of energy stored in the battery. Typical Alkaline capacity is ~2800 mAh, so if you get around 2.8 hours of use, the device draws on average 1 Amp.
Some Del Mar residents say enough is enough when it comes to short-term rentals in their town. The Del Mar City Council agreed on Monday to a temporary ban on short-term rentals to combat complaints of noise, trash, parking and other issues along Del Mar's beachfront. The emergency ban will last 45 days, and can be extended for up to six months. At the same time, the city is trying to come up with regulations on short-term rentals, including a minimum on stay or even an outright ban. The popularity has skyrocketed with web booking services like Airbnb and VRBO.
Oxnard College President Cynthia Azari will officially leave her position at the end of June although she is currently off campus on “paid status,” according to the community college district. In an email to Oxnard College staff Wednesday afternoon, district officials also announced Rojelio Vasquez resigned as the vice president of Academic Affairs at the college. Vasquez had been in the position a little more than a year. Azari joined the college as president in March 2016. According to a statement from the Ventura County Community College District, Azari is leaving her position to spend more time with her family in New York and Southern California.
On the Texas coast, the state's fracking boom has sparked an industrial surge and new fears about pollution. PORT OF CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — For John LaRue, sand was the harbinger of the change. Several years ago, LaRue, the Port of Corpus Christi's executive director, began seeing the smooth quartz grains arriving in bulk from Wisconsin and Minnesota. It's used in fracking, one of the materials injected into shale-rock formations to free oil and natural gas and coax it topside. None of that fracking is happening in this industrial port city down the Gulf Coast from Houston.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Cold War tensions and threat of nuclear war convinced government leaders in the United States that millions of lives could be saved by the construction of home fallout shelters. The idea took a while to take hold. Even though public drills in the event of a nuclear attack was routine in the 1950s, the Eisenhower administration did not actively promote the construction of home fallout shelters. That changed with the 1957 publication of the Gaither Report, which backed the building of shelters that "permit people to come out of the shelters and survive."

All guns are loaded. Never forget this. I never knew my great uncle Gerald. That’s because he was killed in an accident. His son shot him. Uncle Gerald was a hunter in Oregon. He had taught his son to regard every gun as loaded. He always was careful to unload his gun whenever he came in from hunting. But one day he forgot. His son, knowing that his father was meticulous about such things, for some reason pulled the trigger. In my household, I was taught that every gun is loaded until it is examined to see if it is unloaded.
The government yesterday gave approval to seven more private universities, raising their number to 70 in the country. The new universities are Bangladesh University of Health Science in Mirpur, Dhaka, Sonargaon University in Narayanganj, Feni University in Feni, North Western University in Khulna, Britenia University in Comilla, Port City International University in Chittagong and Khaza Yunus Ali University in Sirajganj, said a top official of the education ministry, preferring anonymity. At present, Dhaka alone has 45 private universities. Earlier on March 14, the government approved eight private universities and another one, the university of Exim Bank, last month.
Fumigation services continue to demonstrate their value for a new generation of clients. From protecting homes from drywood termites to eliminating pests in shipments of food and agriculture products arriving at ports on both coasts, fumigation has proven its value again and again. What is in doubt is the products the pest management industry has used to deliver fumigations. The shrinkage of the fumigators’ toolbox has been well-documented over the last decade. Despite the loss of products and ever-tightening regulations, pest management professionals and a new generation of food industry and agriculture professionals have learned to adapt and earn an appreciation for what fumigation brings to the table.
Brain hypoxia is a form of hypoxia or oxygen deficiency affecting the brain. It occurs when the brain does not receive enough oxygen even though blood is still flowing. When oxygen supply is totally cut off, it is called brain anoxia. Brain hypoxia is a medical emergency because the brain needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to function properly. There are several causes of brain hypoxia. They include drowning, suffocating, cardiac arrest, and stroke. Mild symptoms include memory loss and problems with motor function, such as movement. Severe cases can result in seizures and brain death.
Dakota Johnson may not be expecting a child with rumored boyfriend Chris Martin anytime soon, but that doesn’t mean she’s not willing to get involved when it comes to his life as a father of two and co-parent with ex Gwyneth Paltrow. After more than a year together, Johnson reportedly joined in the Thanksgiving festivities with Martin, Paltrow and Paltrow’s new husband, Brad Falchuk. Additionally, Martin and Paltrow’s kids, Apple and Moses, were present for the festivities. According to E! News, this was Johnson and Martin’s first major holiday spent together.
Just outside Colchester, on Middletown Road, sits a homey-looking restaurant called Papa Z’s. Like the name, it’s a family friendly place. As we arrived for our meal, people who had just finished were leaving with satisfaction on their faces and take-home containers in their hands. A beige and brown exterior gives way to knotty pine trim inside. Straight ahead are the ordering counter and the first of two spacious rooms holding comfortable tables and booths. A well-lit display case featured a large array of desserts, including carrot cake, chocolate cake and assorted Greek pastries.
Billy Butler drove in seven runs and hit his first grand slam of his major league career and the Royals needed each and every one of those RBIs as they held on for 9-8 win Sunday at Philadelphia. The Royals fought back from a 4-0 deficit Sunday, piling up a 9-4 lead, only to watch their bullpen stumble again in the ninth. With the winning run on second, Kelvin Herrera struck out Erik Kratz to end the game. The Royals bounced back from Saturday’s 4-3 loss, in which the Phillies scored three in the ninth for the victory.
FROM the Middle Ages, Persians, Arabs, and Turks sent caravans to fetch the oil that puddled the ground and torch-lit the night around the Caspian port of Baku, the world's first oil town. Now the vast reserves under the Caspian Sea and its shores contain the promise of loosening the reliance of Americans and Europeans on the oil of the Middle East. But the bottleneck for tapping these oil deposits has been the pipelines to get the oil out. Existing pipelines either run through Russia or through Iran. With Iran blackballed by an American trade embargo, that leaves all the spigots from the Caspian region in Russian hands.
Force10 Networks, the Silicon Valley (Milpitas) 10 Gigabit switch and router maker, has raked in $40.6 million in a fifth round of venture capital backing. Investors in the company, including Crosslink Capital, Morgenthaler Ventures, New Enterprise Associates and U.S. Venture Partners, have shown how steady backing — even through the panic-ridden days of the post-bubble era — can reap rewards at the end of the day (or, we should say cautiously, looks set to reap rewards, based on the current bullish comments coming from investors about its future and these numerous announcements).
Senate’s passage of Dodd-Frank reform: Needed relief or the beginning of the end? After the Senate passed its Dodd-Frank reform bill Wednesday night, sending it to the House to be voted on, experts began to voice their opinions of the bill – but no one agrees. While some experts claim this bill is a major step in the wrong direction, and puts the market at risk of another collapse such as that seen in 2007, others say it brings common sense regulatory relief. Housing starts slipped to an eight-month low, and experts are beginning to worry about the lack of new homes on the market.
Watch footage of the start of Cameron’s cabinet meeting. David Cameron took the rare step of letting cameras record the first Cabinet meeting of his new government, clearly wanting to showcase the first all-Tory cabinet in 18 years. There is a distinct honeymoon-period vibe to the Conservatives’ celebratory air with the new and reappointed ministers yet to face any real challenges since their surprise win on 7 May. Tory elation is perhaps enhanced by the lack of any major opposition presence, as the Labour party focus on rebuilding their deflated party - and members such as Chuka Umunna launch their leadership bid.
A tricky, thread-the-needle winter storm is expected to affect the Philadelphia area this evening and overnight with the possibility of accumulating snow. Sunny skies early will give way to clouds as the afternoon progresses. A cold front passed through last night bringing in enough cold enough air that a storm approaching from the south later today should produce wintry precipitation. It is perfect timing. Precipitation will start in the late afternoon and early evening. It is expected to clear out in the early AM hours. Areas far south and east will get only rain.
Brexiteers like Boris Johnson inhabit an outdated form of sovereignty. A new realm of power - regulation - demands shared authority and is the EU's greatest achievement. Britain helped create it and can't leave it. Leviathan T-shirt thanks to Red Bubble T-Shirts. Regulation, reinforced by human rights, has become a new sphere of government. It is now as essential to modern society as executive power, legislative authority and courts of law. The way we experience this is also novel. It does not stem from the influence of politicians, the role of authority whether national or local, or fear of justice.
The so-called Big 6 have found common ground on the best ways to pay for individual and corporate tax cuts. President Donald Trump’s top aides and congressional leaders have made significant strides in shaping a tax overhaul, moving far beyond the six-paragraph framework pushed out in July that stoked fears about their ability to deliver on one of the GOP’s top priorities. There is broad consensus, according to five sources familiar with the behind-the-scenes talks, on some of the best ways to pay for cutting both the individual and corporate tax rates.
"The image (we gave) was spectacular. This is who we are," Messi said. "I was fortunate the first went in, I struck it hard and just inside the post. I needed a little more luck on the second. The important thing is that we achieved our goal. We have taken one more step (to the title)." "Messi and Cristiano (Ronaldo) have been the best players in the world for the past decade," Solskjaer said. "And he showed why we think that and why he has won so many titles.
Police in Japan are questioning officials from the company which runs the uranium fuel processing plant at the centre of the country's worst nuclear accident. The authorities say Tokaimura, where the plant is situated, is now safe and radiation levels have returned to normal. "A major accident resulting in a radioactive leak has happened. We apologise from the bottom of our hearts," said company President Koji Kitani, bowing deeply at a news conference in Tokyo on Thursday. Three workers saw a blue flash and were overcome with nausea. They were taken to hospital barely conscious and with low blood pressure.
🔔 Lyft, America's second biggest ride-hailing service, went public on the Nasdaq today. Click here to follow Lyft's real-time trading. The company priced its IPO at $72 a share on Thursday, valuing it at around $24 billion. Why this matters: Lyft's debut could be a bellwether for how other on-demand startups will be received by public investors in the months to come. And it will almost certainly be seen as a proxy for what to expect from its chief rival, Uber. We're also watching the broader markets and Brexit today.

Single and looking for love on the Space Coast? Heck, maybe even something less than love? Brevard County probably isn't your best bet, according to a recently released study that analyzed more than 300 U.S. metro areas for the top locations to be single. Brevard ranked No. 113, earning it a grade of "C-." The study — conducted by a group called Zumper — came up with its ranking by studying the number of singles within a population, percentage of singles with bachelor degrees or higher, the number of restaurants and bars per capita, and more.
New Delhi: Gaurav Kishore, a student at the Dr B.C. Roy Engineering College in Durgapur, a steel city that’s a commuter train ride away from West Bengal’s capital Kolkata, had his parents buy him a Dell laptop and an Internet connection in September. He had class assignments to complete for which a computer could be useful. But there was another over-riding consideration behind the purchase: Kishore, 20, wanted to get into the habit of reading online. Tech-savvy: Students taking a mock test for the online CAT run by prep firm Career Launcher.
The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care updated the guidelines, taking into account a woman’s personal values. Endurance athletes “always live longer than their sedentary peers, and there remains no conclusive evidence that their exercise is dangerous,” said a cardiologist. The results are expected to spare up to 70,000 patients a year in the United States and many more elsewhere the ordeal and expense of these drugs. People with schizophrenia had higher rates of death for all causes, such as heart disease, cancer, respiratory failure and metabolic disorders, including diabetes.

I have to start by apologizing. I have been gone for way too long. Well, I have good reason, I promise! Since my last entry I have been in two shows, run projections for another show, completed my junior year, and have maintained a steady social life in between! The first show that I was in this semester was Shakespeare’s, “The Tempest.” It was a blast to be a part of. The production was a part of a student run organization on campus called Shakespeare in the Dark. SITD puts on student directed productions of different Shakespeare plays.
A piece from Paul Krugman in The New York Times this week criticizes bitcoin for being antisocial and for not having a State-controlled supply while secretly admiring its powerful abstractness. As a complicit minion in the State's appropriation of the monetary unit, Krugman perpetuates 'The State Theory of Money' myth that the sovereign's power to collect taxes and declare legal tender imbues a currency with ultimate value. While that may be a reason to acquire a certain amount of government fiat currency, it is a transitory value because in the end it is still based on a State-sanctioned illusion.
WINNIPEG — 2016 shaped up to a winning year for those lucky enough to cash in by playing the lottery. Figures released Wednesday by the Western Canada Lottery Corporation show 57 prizes of $1 million or more were handed out on the prairies. In Manitoba, 11 winners won a combined total of $13.6 million. In Sandy Hook, a single winning ticket was worth $1 million. Winnipeg had eight big winners totalling $10.6 million.

COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Buckeye State is poised to tip the balance of medical marijuana in the U.S., as a historic piece of legislation passes the Ohio House, headed for the senate. House Bill 523 would give Ohioans with certain medical conditions the right to use medical marijuana, the Columbus Dispatch reported . Passage in Ohio would mean half the states and the District of Columbia allow the drug for medicinal use. But leaders in the Ohio Senate weren’t sure the bill would make it to Gov. John Kasich’s desk.
Special Report Digital audio began life with high ideals and worthy engineering feats, with its extended dynamic range came the promise of noise-free recording. This is a story of how it first charmed and then choked the industry it was designed to enhance. It's a long and complicated story, full of challenges and unforeseen consequences. In the first part, I'll explain how some of the strange choices were made by the earliest digital audio engineers. It's 1987, and London Zoo is playing host to a conference called the Digital Information Exchange (DIE) run by HHB – a professional audio hire and sales company.
Ex-MA Gov. Mitt Romney's third quarter financial audit has yet to be posted at the FEC's website, but while we wait, you can read over this internal memo written by the campaign's legal and strategy teams and distributed to campaign higher ups last week. My quick summary: We're raising a lot; Mitt is giving a lot; We're spending a lot; We're winning where we need to be winning; Rudy's in trouble because he can't write himself a check and has to spend to keep pace.
Wydad Casablanca of Morocco will begin the defence of their African Champions League title against either Mali's Stade Malien or newcomers Williamsville AC of Ivory Coast. As the reigning champions, Wydad are one of five teams to be given a bye into the second round of the tournament, which begins in March. Beaten finalists in 2017 Al Ahly of Egypt and DR Congo's Confederation Cup winners TP Mazembe are also straight into the second round. The other teams to skip the first round are the 2016 African champions Mamelodi Sundowns from South Africa and Tunisia's Etoile du Sahel, who lifted the trophy in 2007.
Fujitsu has developed a wireless communications receiver that can transfer data at a rate of around 20 gigabits per second while being small enough to fit in a smartphone. The component would allow mobile devices to transfer 4K or 8K videos almost instantly. 8K is a new video format with 16 times the resolution of today's high-definition TVs. Fujitsu is calling it the world's first compact 300GHz receiver with that level of high-speed wireless communications. The device is smaller than 1 cubic centimeter and combines a receiver-amplifier chip and terahertz-band antenna into one unit.
After her daughter's death from leukemia, Carol Schwartz said a better bone marrow registry would have given them "more hope." More than seven years after her daughter Mandi’s death from leukemia, Carol Schwartz says she believes a more robust bone marrow registry could have prolonged or saved Mandi’s life. The annual Run for Mandi that takes place in Saskatoon is one way the Schwartz family is trying to honour Mandi’s memory and raise awareness for the importance of a bone marrow registry to ensure matches can be found.

WILMINGTON, NC (WECT) - Hours before UNCW’s men’s basketball team was scheduled to play at North Carolina, one of the team’s reserve guards indicated he will miss some playing time. Jacque Brown, a 5-foot-10 senior, tweeted Wednesday afternoon that he is having surgery. WECT's John Smist confirmed it's a knee surgery for Brown, whose season is most likely over.

Customers try out Apple Inc. devices near the company's iPod Shuffle at the Gateway Apple Store in Salt Lake City, Utah on Sept. 10, 2007. Reports of the iPod Shuffle's demise appear to be premature. Following legitimate shortages of the pint-sized MP3 player at retail stores, the Apple press corps began speculating that it was poised to join the iPod Classic at the gadget retirement home. Rather than being discontinued, however, sources with knowledge of the situation tell Billboard that Apple is actually going thorough component supplier changes that have interrupted production of the Shuffle.
NEW YORK — Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is asking CNN to donate to veterans the proceeds from advertising sold to air during next week's Republican debate. In a Tuesday letter to the cable news network, the billionaire says he is the reason the network sharply increased its rates ahead of the Sept. 16 debate in Simi Valley, California. Trade publications have reported that CNN is asking for up to $200,000 for a 30-second ad, and that typical rates run as low as $5,000. Trump writes that the spike in viewer interest "is due 100 percent to Donald J.
Pharmacy retailer and services giant CVS Health Corporation announced its second-quarter financial results before the market opened on Tuesday. Those results appeared to be on track, but shares have dropped more than 4% as of the time of this writing. What happened? Here are the highlights. By the numbersThat reactionary fall didn&apos;t stem from an earnings miss. CVS posted earnings of $1.27 billion -- up 2.1% year over year. On a GAAP basis, that translated to $1.12 per share. Adjusted earnings for second quarter were $1.22 per share excluding $0.03 ofacquisition-related transaction and financing costs.
As the economy continues to struggle, fundamental attitudes toward business are little changed. Americans continue to see the success of business as central to the strength of the country. At the same time, large majorities continue to say that business corporations make too much profit and fail to strike a fair balance between making profits and serving the public interest. As recent surveys have shown, the public also is of two minds about government regulation of business. Most Americans agree that free markets need government regulation to protect the public interest. However, nearly as many say that government regulation of business usually causes more harm than good.
Privacy slats update a chain-link fence for a fresh appearance. An existing chain-link fence converts to a privacy fence using slats through the mesh openings, rolled bamboo or planting a living ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens) fence. Privacy fences not only reduce visibility into your yard but also reduce noise, provide security and act as a windbreak from coastal breezes. Ocotillo grows well in U.S. Department of Agriculture hardiness zones 8 through 11 in full sun and sandy soil. It can be planted at any time of the year to leaf out and fill in your chain-link fence to create a private oasis.
Again: Greatness is fleeting. Enjoy your home runs. This shouldn't be a thing anymore, but it remains a thing because we keep making it a thing: Whenever a Major League Baseball player dares demonstrate that he enjoys his utterly enviable profession, someone, somewhere, grumbles that he needs to stop being so selfish as to revel in his own accomplishments and should instead put his head down and work harder to help his team win and respect the game. Much of the complaints come from crotchety old ballplayers; others hail from the jilted late-inning relievers that gave up a game-deciding blast.
MANILA, January 24, 2005 (STAR) By Jess Diaz - Twenty-five government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs) are expected to lose P103 billion this year in taxpayers’ money even as Filipinos are asked to tighten their belts and pay more taxes. Heading the list of losers, according to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), is the National Power Corp. (Napocor), which lost more than P100 billion last year and will lose an estimated P83.52 billion this year. Napocor accounted for a big part of the huge national debt.

LEON HARRIS, CNN ANCHOR: We're going to take a look now at a picture we've got from the Rose Garden at the White House. We're waiting. And as we see there, President Bush is coming out. We expect he's going to make a couple of announcements. The key one is going to be the announcement of his new drug policy czar. And he is John Walters. That is who is accompanying the president to the podium. Walters is a somewhat controversial choice to some, because he is known as being a hard-liner when it comes to fighting the war on drugs.
Equipment upgrade should save Durham Public Works Dept. DURHAM — The installation of new energy efficient aeration blowers is expected to reduce annual energy use at the Town of Durham's Public Works Department by more than 217,300 kilowatt hours per year and result in an estimated $39,000 in annual savings. Public Service of New Hampshire provided support for the energy efficiency improvement -- under its nhsaves@work Large Business New Construction program -- with an incentive check for $52,454. The new turbo type centrifugal blowers replaced the existing dual lobe positive displacement blowers.
A massive dam planned for China's Yangtze River has been placed on the Ten Year Plan and passed by the Seventh Session of the Thirteenth Conference of the Communist Party. The Three Gorges Dam, which will be the largest ever built, had been the subject of unprecedented protests in China until the massacre at Tienanmen Square. The chief proponent of the dam is Premier Li Peng. Mid-1990 reports from China indicated that he had resurrected the scheme after it had been officially shelved for financial reasons. The dam will be 200 metres high, flood 1.2 million people off their land and cost the country an estimated $12 billion.
Sandra Arnold has started a national database to find lost African-American cemeteries. Many historians and communities of color have taken on local, smaller-scale projects to find lost burial sites, but this was the first attempt at a national database. Now a graduate with a degree in history, Arnold is the founding director of the Periwinkle Initiative, the organization that is developing and will maintain the burial sites database. The initiative is named after the wildflower that, according to folklore, dots the gravesites of the enslaved so that loved ones can find them. Arnold finds burial grounds, documents their history and advocates to protect the sites.
But perhaps the primary reason to visit Saint John is its access to the Bay of Fundy. This large inlet separating New Brunswick from Nova Scotia is an ideal backdrop for outdoor excursions. You can get a feel for Fundy's powerful tides in the heart of Saint John with a visit to Reversing Falls. But to truly experience the bay's beauty, head out of town to one of New Brunswick's natural parks where Fundy views beckon to hikers. Just keep your eyes peeled: You're bound to catch a glimpse of a whale or two.
One California law firm seems to be bypassing PayPal's ban on white nationalist fundraising. In the wake of the tragic violence at last year’s “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the backlash from Big Tech was swift. GoDaddy, the popular web hosting service, forced the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer to find another domain provider. Discord, Google, Cloudflare, and Facebook all issued forceful condemnations of white supremacy and promised to ban any far-right group using their platforms. Twitter began stripping prominent far-right accounts of their coveted blue ticks.
Google’s DeepMind and the Royal Free London NHS deal to use patient data without explicit consent was "inexcusable", an academic paper has concluded in a damning report today. In 2016, DeepMind announced its first major health project: a collaboration with the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust – a large UK hospital organization – to assist in the management of acute kidney injury. Initially received with great enthusiasm, the collaboration has suffered from a lack of clarity and openness, with issues of privacy and power emerging as potent challenges as the project has unfolded, noted the paper.
MedMen, the best-known cannabis retailer in the United States, is racing to raise cash to cover its mounting losses. Its struggles show the challenge cannabis companies face in operating in states where high taxes and dispensary restrictions have driven up prices for legal marijuana. In California, MedMen's core market, highly regulated companies are struggling to compete for customers with illicit dealers who charge far less. A customer buys cannabis products at MedMen, one of the two Los Angeles area pot shops that began selling marijuana for recreational use under the new California marijuana law today, on January 2, 2018 in West Hollywood, California.
To some, it's known as the old stone armory on Bank Street in Fall River. But to those who know what takes place behind the thick walls, it is a beacon of opportunity and hope, both of which start with a simple question: What do you want to learn today? Seated at his desk in a big office which bears a sign reading "Organization is for people who don't know how to look for things" is Terry Moran, the director of Fall River's YouthBuild. His face is kind, his smile is huge and he oozes pride for his program.
WAYNE ROONEY has fired an angry message to Manchester United stars over Jose Mourinho. Manchester United have made a stuttering start to the Premier League campaign, with just five wins from 10 games. Mourinho has come under intense pressure and it was thought before the Newcastle game earlier this month that he would be sacked regardless of the result. The Portuguese tactician survived and recorded two wins in three games in the league in October against the Magpies and Everton. His problems with his players, in particular Paul Pogba, has been well documented.
Heisman Trophy winner and six-year NFL veteran Danny Wuerffel was released from a hospital Wednesday after being treated for Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a nervous system disorder. Pat Dooley of Gainesville Sun broke the news and says the disease is potentially fatal but can be treated if found early. Doctors passes along word that doctors anticipate a full recovery. Wuerffel has helped run the Desire Street Ministries since his retirement. We wish him all the best in his recovery. Thats what they now think FDR had. My mother-in-law had that. Didn’t kill her. He’ll be fine, I’m sure.

Thailand is now investigating cases of microcephaly to see if they're linked to Zika infection, the World Health Organization said Thursday. Since a Public Health Emergency of International Concern was declared in February, WHO has been working with countries across the Region, including India, to strengthen Zika virus and birth-defect surveillance, enhance vector surveillance and control and scale-up laboratory capacity among others. Chip Kelly knew that rebuilding the 49ers would be a process when he took the head coaching job this past offseason. The Cardinals quarterback started in all 16 regular season games a year ago and led Arizona to a 13-3 record.
COVINA – In a game that featured two of the top teams in the Valle Vista League, San Dimas High School’s boys basketball team squeaked past Covina 48-45 on Wednesday night. San Dimas guard Eric O’Mahony buried a 3-pointer late in the fourth quarter to put the Saints up, 48-40. The Colts (10-8, 2-1) made a valiant attempt to come back when Paul Clark came up with a steal and Josh Lucero finished the play with a layup. Gabe Alt made a 3-point basket on the Colts’ ensuing possession, but Covina came up short after a last-second 3-point attempt bounced off the rim.

While I have been mistaken for him on Twitter, to the occasional amusement of what is currently now 3,300 followers, I do not have very much in common with Rob Ford. After all, I work as a composer and sound designer for theatre and film who has won numerous awards and was shortlisted last year for the prestigious Siminovitch Prize. And since the end of May, I have managed to both amuse and confuse with the Twitter account @TOMayorFrod, which has provided a satirical commentary on events since the fallout from reports about the infamous video.
Benoit Peyrucq, AFP | Peter Cherif during his trial in Paris on January 26, 2011. French jihadist Peter Cherif, a known associate of the Kouachi brothers who killed 12 people in the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, has been arrested in Djibouti said an informed source Thursday. Cherif, also known by the pseudonym Abou Hamza, is being held while awaiting transfer to France, said the source. He was linked to a Paris jihadist cell and was named in the enquiry into the attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015 over his regular contact with the perpetrators Said and Cherif Kouachi.
New year, new location for Shine Restaurant & Potion Bar. The oh-so-Boulder spot closed up in September on 13th St. (now home to The Post Brewing Co.), but will open up at a new location in The Village Shopping Center on Jan. 5. If you’re curious about the potions part of the name (and I know you are), a press release describes them as being, “enchanted beverages” that “through a harmony of nourishing adaptogenic herbs, vibrational essences, sound-frequencies and more” are “tuned to a specific intention.” So that’s totally normal.
As one of the world’s most successful fantasy fiction authors, Feist finds himself in a strange position. When he started writing, his books were niche, embraced by a small but enthusiastic community. Some time during his 36-year career, the public’s attitude towards the fantasy genre underwent a colossal shift. It’s easy to point to causes after the fact – say the success of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, or the popularity of Harry Potter. But it’s harder to discern why audiences were ready to hear these kinds of stories.
In a perfect match of venue and vehicle, Missouri State University's Tent Theatre opens its 53rd season with a lively musical about a corrupt faith healer who plies his trade under an outdoor canvas big top. As with "110 in the Shade," staged by Tent forces in 2013, Alan Menken and Glenn Slater's "Leap of Faith" asks the audience to root for a charismatic charlatan who learns to see the light by the time the finale arrives. Based on the 1992 movie starring Steve Martin and Debra Winger, the 2012 musical adaptation adds pop-rock vocals and lots of crowd-pleasing gospel-inspired chorus numbers.
The mayor wants new safety requirements including registering and fingerprinting ridesharing drivers. Columbia, SC - The parents of a slain University of South Carolina student and the mayor of Columbia are calling for changes in security to ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft. The suggestions are coming following the killing last month of 21-year-old Samantha Josephson, a senior at the school. Josephson was hanging out with friends in Columbia's Five Points when she mistakenly got into a car she thought was her Uber ride. The person at the wheel was not an Uber driver at all; instead, police say it was 24-year-old Nathaniel Rowland.

Spring is in the air and the time for a new start is reflected by the seasons. This is the time of the year when we make real New Year resolutions, not when we’re mired by the start of grey and cold January. It’s time to get away from the screens that are dotted around our homes and head out into the real world, see something that has texture and hear something that has meaning and is from nature. There is nothing like birdsong to lift the heart, but things are changing in our skies.

One by one they made their way into the softball stadium at Chatham Glenwood High School or, in the case of the baseball players, Robin Roberts Stadium. They were in their school uniforms, most of them for the final time, and they walked with a nervous gait. It’s fun to watch the players as they arrive for The State Journal-Register’s annual Baseball Classic and Softball Classic all-star games. One by one they made their way into the softball stadium at Chatham Glenwood High School or, in the case of the baseball players, Robin Roberts Stadium.
With LeBron James leaving Cleveland to join the Lakers, ending his streak of eight consecutive seasons representing the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals, the door is open for a new power to rise. And the NBA is making it quite clear that it views the Celtics and 76ers as two of the teams most likely to fill the void. Boston and Philadelphia will face each other in Boston in the Oct. 16 season opener at TD Garden at 8 p.m. as part of TNT’s season tip-off doubleheader that also includes a game between the Thunder and Warriors.
A Shirley man was sentenced today to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the 2010 torture and murder of his estranged girlfriend, who was killed in the basement of his mother's home, Middlesex prosecutors said. Robert Gulla, 21, was found guilty yesterday of first-degree murder for the Jan. 23, 2010 stabbing death of 19-year-old Allison Myrick, Middlesex District Attorney Gerry Leone's office said.

This would be a terrible marketing decision from Apple, if true. A report recently surfaced claiming that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may call its next-generation iPhone, widely believed to be called the iPhone 7, the "iPhone 6SE." Here's why this report, which comes from Apfelpage.de (via 9to5Mac), seems unlikely to be true. The iPhone 6s didn't perform particularly well in the marketplace. During its cycle, Apple has seemingly lost market segment share to its rivals and saw its first-ever declines in iPhone unit and revenue shipments year over year.

A homeless man was caught searching for bedding in a Mansfield recycling skip in the early hours of the morning. Police were called to the council recycling centre, on Kestral Road, after CCTV operators spotted Robert Shepherd and two other men going through the skips with a torch at 1.30am, on June 11. Prosecutor Simon Rowe said: “He told police he went through a hole in the fence and they had been there before. He said Shepherd had made 37 previous appearances in court since 1999, for 106 offences, 74 of which were for theft.
Armenia and Turkey have taken a step toward reconciliation -- announcing that they will launch final talks aimed at establishing diplomatic ties. But diplomatic protocols announced on Monday still need to be approved by the parliaments of both countries. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutiun) party has criticized a deal between the Armenian and Turkish governments that could pave the way for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, RFE/RL's Armenian Service reports. Javid Huseynov argues that one of the keys to finding a peaceful resolution for Nagorno-Karabakh is achieving the normalization of relations between the region's ethnic Armenian and Azeri communities.
The Reagan Administration has apologized to a Harvard researcher who says the Justice Department misrepresented his views on the transmission of AIDS. The Public Health Service, a unit of the Department of Health and Human Services, has repeatedly said there is no evidence that the AIDS virus is spread through casual contact on the job, or in schools or similar settings. In the opinion, Mr. Cooper declared that the 1973 law ''simply does not reach decisions based on fear of contagion, whether reasonable or not,'' unless the fear was a pretext for discrimination on account of handicap.

Keller has previously worked on mobile processors, where he helped out on the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S with Apple's A4 and A5S processors, respectively.
Entering their matchup on Wednesday, the Philadelphia Flyers and the Toronto Maple Leafs were only separated by two points in the standings. Considering that, one would have thought that the Flyers and Leafs were in for a close, hard fought game tonight. As fate would have it, nothing could be farther from the truth as the Flyers routed the Leafs by a score of 6-2. Daniel Briere scored twice for the Flyers, with Mike Richards, Dan Carcillo— who scored a beauty, Danny Syvret, and rookie James Van Riemsdyk all netting goals.
The latest international company to delve into the social gaming world is a Japanese mobile service provider by the name of C.A. Mobile. Since the Tokyo-based company focuses mostly on mobile content in the country, it partnered with French-Canadian developer, Montreal-based ODD1 to help it get a foothold with a simple little social Facebook app called Bingo Derby. With a history of casual and mobile games – most recently the iPhone title Catch Me! If You Can – under its belt, ODD1 seems like a good choice. However, how did their first social game attempt measure up?

PARIS (Reuters) - A French court cancelled the licence for one of Monsanto’s glyphosate-based weedkillers on Tuesday over safety concerns, placing an immediate ban on Roundup Pro 360 in the latest legal blow to the Bayer-owned business. Germany’s Bayer (BAYGn.DE), which bought Monsanto for $63 billion last year, faces thousands of U.S. lawsuits by people who say its Roundup and Ranger Pro products caused their cancer. A court in Lyon in southeast France ruled that the approval granted by French environment agency ANSES in 2017 for Roundup Pro 360 had failed to take into account potential health risks.
Even with the first Android device set to launch in a matter of days, Google (NSDQ: GOOG) still has the iPhone and the inherent opportunities it presents high on its mind. The company has been meeting with ad agencies recently to show off different ways to integrate advertising into searches conducted on the phone, AdWeek reports. Google is working to give advertisers the ability to integrate iPhone ad groups into their regular search campaign. The idea is to give ad agencies an opportunity to create iPhone-specific ads that might draw in more interest than ads simply repurposed from online ads created primarily for PCs.
Written by Nicola Yoon, this book tells the story of Maddy -- a teenage girl who falls in love despite an illness that prevents her from going outside.

In this photo taken Dec. 11, 2010, people look at the holiday window display at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. Make that "some consumers." With unemployment stuck near 10 percent, home prices falling and foreclosures still rising, holiday shopping this year has brought into sharper focus the divide between upper- and lower-income American households. The split mood among holiday shoppers is heavily tied to their employment outlook: Those at the upper end of the income ladder are feeling much better about their job prospects and income security than those at the bottom.
Technology is bringing ever-increasing ease and organization to so many aspects of our life and Dcovery is a new app for iOS aimed at revolutionizing the way that we travel, using only our smartphone and the Internet. In essence, the service is aimed at giving travelers the tools to build their own travel guides in order to explore the world as they want.

I love giving advice. I write blogs, articles and a newsletter. I host a radio show. I tweet, Facebook and share nuggets of advice almost daily. So what is it in all of that, that would make anyone think they can still have the right to "pick my brain"? I can't tell you how flattering it is to be approached by representatives from major companies seeking my wisdom and advice. It shows they are listening, and like what I have to say. But often I find the road ends when they are just on a fact finding mission.

She had bleached and cut her hair and looked “reasonably good” for the ordeal, but 15-year-old Jasmine Fike was a familiar face to Aurora Police Sgt.

She remained in custody and was being questioned. Police are still looking for people they have identified only as “known criminals” in the girl’s apparent runaway attempt.

The Good Decent image quality; includes video and audio inputs; stylish. The Bad Not HDTV compatible; no PIP function; few adjustability options; stiff tilt function; DVD playback is a mixed bag. The Bottom Line This reasonably priced LCD has decent image quality and some nice extras, but it sacrifices some basics, such as adjustability. It could be a good purchase for someone on a budget. Apple, IBM, and sometimes Samsung aside, display manufacturers seem to put little effort into making the most of an LCD's style potential.
The legal arguments over the future of the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant continue, with parties to file this week on how the state Public Service Board should handle its review of a new state permit for the plant. Meanwhile, the clock ticks toward March 21st, when the company’s permission to store more high-radioactive nuclear waste on the plant site in Vernon may expire. The plant won federal approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate for 20 years beyond its originally scheduled shutdown date–less than three weeks away. And a federal judge has ruled against the state Legislature’s efforts to block that continued operation from happening.
The computer glitch could jeopardize thousands of holiday flights. Are you traveling this holiday season? If you're taking an American Airlines flight on or around Christmas, you might not be—even despite your best efforts. A glitch in the airline's computer system mistakenly allowed all its pilots to take time off during the high season around Christmas, and thousands of flights could be disrupted as a result. As ABC's Sam Sweeny reports, American Airlines is attempting to rectify the situation by offering time and a half for pilots who agree to fly.
Despite what you've seen of the terrible destruction wrought by Superstorm Sandy in the media last year (including that now-iconic photo of a drowned roller coaster), the Jersey Shore hasn't gone anywhere. But the perception that it was wiped away, according to a new poll, was strong enough to keep people away from the coastline this summer. The poll, conducted by Monmouth University-Asbury Park Press, found that nearly 40 percent of Jersey residents spent less time at the shore than usual. Of those, half said they stayed away at least in part because they expected most businesses wouldn't be open.

Exactly one year from Friday, the 2010 Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games will begin. For spectators, Friday means they can buy tickets and start making concrete plans. For organizers, Lexington officials, and people at the Kentucky Horse Park, Friday means ... well, if not panic, then a well-regulated focus on the hundreds of things, big and small, that have to get done before the Games. "The sense of urgency has kicked in." said Steve Austin, director of the Legacy Center, which is working on some key projects affiliated with the Games.
DES MOINES, Iowa – Iowans are being warned about a scam the Iowa Department of Public Safety says is misrepresenting the department’s staff. The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation says it has received reports about scammers posing as employees of the “Iowa State Police” and calling people to claim they’ve seized a vehicle registered in their name that drugs were found in. The DCI says people are getting multiple calls from a 712 area code phone number. If no one answers or the person hangs up, scammers make more calls from “911” and become verbally aggressive.
New York saw a 9.6 percent drop in home prices from January 2008 through January 2009, according to a widely watched index measuring home prices in metropolitan areas. Though steep, this decline is relatively small compared to the declines seen in many of the 20 cities measured by the index. In fact, U.S. home prices sank by the sharpest annual rate on record (data has been gathered in this manner since 2000) in January - a steep 19 percent decline, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller 20-city housing index, which measures home prices in large metropolitan areas.

Victims receive treatment at a hospital, after an explosion in Maiduguri, Nigeria, June 17, 2015. A large sack of home-made bombs discovered at an abandoned Boko Haram camp exploded, killing 63 people, witnesses said Wednesday of a toll many times higher than in any recent attack in northeast Nigeria. The explosives were found by civilian self-defense fighters who carried the bag filled with metal objects to the nearby town of Monguno, said fighters including Haruna Bukar. A curious crowd gathered to inspect the bag, which is why there were so many victims when it exploded, said Bukar, who witnessed the blast.

Just in case the new leader of the Free World hasn’t seen one of Carson’s YouTube videos, Carson scribbled his website lockerboard.net on the napkin, leaving the note with one of Trump’s security personnel. Carson said this week that he hasn’t heard back from the president, yet, but that may be understandable. “He’s got a few other things he’s working on,” Carrie Kropfl said. Carson, however, has built five Locker Boards with Trump’s youngest son, Barron — who is about his age — in mind.
ROCHESTER, Indiana — The woman accused of crashing into four Indiana children as they crossed the street to get on a school bus pleaded not guilty Thursday morning, according to ABC 57 News in South Bend. The suspect, 24-year-old Alyssa Shepherd, had previously told police she saw the lights from the bus but didn't realize what it was until the kids were in front of her.

The crash happened Oct. 30, near the intersection of State Road 25 and CR 400 N in Fulton County.
Shares in GAM have taken another beating after it was forced to suspend dealing on its unconstrained absolute return bond funds. The house said it was forced to act after clients requested a 'high level of redemptions' following the suspension of department head Tim Haywood(pictured) earlier this week. Haywood was put on leave after an internal investigation into his record-keeping and risk management. At the time, GAM warned it was braced for outflows as a result. At 9.30am in the UK, shares in GAM had lost 14% of their value. This followed the 20% slump following Haywood's suspension.
Can Jack Dorsey Successfully Run 2 Public Companies? Jack Dorsey is about to have his hands full. Should either Twitter or Square be concerned? Running two companies is never an easy thing, but the good news is that there are several examples of executives who were successful at it. Steve Jobs did it, and Elon Musk is doing it as we speak. With Jack Dorsey recently returning to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) as permanent CEO, and his other company, payments start-up Square, now filing to go public, Dorsey may soon find himself in charge of two public companies.
Just in time to celebrate the winter solstice. If you’ve already devoured all the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina episodes currently on Netflix, you’re in luck: next month, the streamer will release a holiday episode, so we can all live deliciously for at least one more hour this year. Although Netflix is touting the episode as a holiday special, Vulture notes that the hour, titled Chilling Adventures of Sabrina: A Midwinter’s Tale, is actually just the eleventh of the 20 installments Netflix has ordered from the supernatural drama. Still, we’ll take it.
“The Artist” arrives just in time for Christmas giving. Finally, a movie that comes practically gift-wrapped with a big red bow, suitable for every recipient, regardless of age, temperament or taste. The silent, black-and-white film, by French director Michel Hazanavicius, is one of the movies a critic can recommend to just about anyone, from snooty cineastes, who will adore Hazanavicius’s constant references to the legend and lore of classic films, to harried filmgoers who just want something amusing and entertaining to see with parents, kids, grandparents or shy second dates.
Idaho has many lovely qualities. It has great vistas, wonderful fishing, and potatoes (Famous Potatoes, in point of fact). But it also is filled with people who want to kill OR-7, and his other OR and non-OR buddies. I understand that wolves kill livestock and so on. But I wish that Idaho, like many other states, would stop with the steel-jawed traps. Can you imagine how painful and agonizing this is for a being with a highly developed nervous system? I'm not anti-hunting at all, but at least in hunting, it's over quickly.

Music|Players Are Wanted for Ben Johnston’s Works. Some Sacrifice Is Required. Players Are Wanted for Ben Johnston’s Works. Some Sacrifice Is Required. According to experts, the most difficult string quartet ever written is Ben Johnston’s Quartet No. 7. It was composed in 1984 but went unperformed for decades. Musicians who knew the score, with the ingenious palindromic structure of one movement and variations teeming with over a thousand microscopically distinct pitches, considered it well-nigh unplayable. Now the work is available on a CD that the Kepler Quartet released hard on the heels of the composer’s 90th birthday in March.

We are realizing slowly that when you try to hire great people through mechanical means by searching their resumes for keywords, you don't get the results you want. You have to hire people through human means, by engaging with them as people rather than as bundles of skills and professional credentials. Everybody has a story. We all resonate better with certain people and cultures than with others. We need to get the human element back into recruiting. It would be good for shareholders, customers, team members and job-seekers if more employers would treat their recruiting processes as human activities rather than mechanical ones.
The 1975's lead singer Matt Healy is no stranger to controversy - and now the star is hitting out at artists who charge fans for meet and greets. It's not the first time the lead singer of The 1975 has spoken out about flaws in the music industry; during the 2019 BRIT Awards, he gave an impassioned speech about misogyny, quoting Laura Snape's article for The Guardian. The star frequently uses his platform to discuss political matters, also, speaking to fans at The 1975's gigs about Brexit and Donald Trump.
The beginning of 2019 produced the most layoffs in a first quarter in 10 years, amid rising concerns of an impending recession. “Total announced cuts hit 190,410, a 10.3 percent increase from the fourth quarter and 35.6 percent jump from the same period a year ago,” CNBC reported Friday. The quarterly jobs cuts are the most since the third quarter of 2015, and the most for a first quarter since 2009. President Donald Trump on Friday called on the Federal Reserve to return to quantitative easing, the monetary policy launched during the 2008-09 Great Recession that increased the money supply and lowered interest rates.

Thorpe of the New York Trucking and Delivery Association says the decision to raise penalties won’t solve the parking crisis.

It's a conflict that has intensified in recent years as ride-hail services have clogged roads, New Yorkers have had more of their purchases delivered, and the streetscape has been remade with bicycle lanes, pedestrian malls and restrictions on parking and unloading.

Wide Adventure Guide service. NAUBINWAY — I’ve signed on to kayak with adventure guide Kellie Nightlinger, then snorkel around a Great Lakes shipwreck. I’d been worrying myself sleepless over the logistics of how one might jump out of a kayak amid the shoals, and trickier yet, how to get back in. And like that, I find myself outfitted in knee and elbow pads and a helmet.

MILLIE Mackintosh has been the centre of controversy ever since she divorced Professor Green and kissed Hugo Taylor. In case you missed it, the former Made In Cheslea star took to Instagram to share a smooch with her ex just weeks after splitting from the rapper. But it would appear Millie has caused another stir with a new beachwear snap, standing in a white swimsuit in Monaco, Millie captioned the image: "When your bikini matches your boat @calzedonia." And although the white number is beautiful – you can get it for £62 from Calzedonia – fans couldn't quite get their heads around the comparison.

The UK government is once again suggesting encryption has no place in citizens' hands, in the wake of revelations that Westminster attacker Khalid Masood was using WhatsApp shortly before murdering pedestrians with his car, and stabbing a police officer to death. While she stopped short of threatening a Brazilian-style outright ban on encrypted private messaging, interior minister Amber Rudd complained on BBC Television over the weekend that such applications give terrorists a "place to hide". UK readers can see the clip on BBC iPlayer, here. The comments are hardly surprising in the context of a long-running and often toxic debate over government access to encrypted communications.
Russia’s recognition of “North Macedonia” disappointed many activists in what Moscow would have otherwise continued to regard as the Republic of Macedonia per its constitutionally legitimate name, but this purely political move shouldn’t have been all that unexpected in hindsight because it correlates with speculation that Moscow plans to take the lead in shaping the “New Balkans”. Russia surprised many observers in the Balkans when it recognized “North Macedonia” in spite of its previous principled opposition to the post-Color Revolution government’s blatantly illegal disregard of the population’s unequivocal refusal to support this move during last year’s referendum.
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder released an energy and environmental policy blueprint. It calls for increasing production of natural gas in Michigan while making no further commitment to requiring the state to rely more on renewable power sources in the coming years. The Republican governor told The Associated Press that natural gas plays a central role in an energy policy that seeks greater efficiency and improvements to infrastructure such as pipelines and the electric transmission grid. It proposes establishing a "strategic natural gas reserve" designed to make the resource more affordable and defends the practice of hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," to extract gas from deep underground.

David Freese is a World Series away from filing his paperwork and becoming the best available third baseman on the free-agent market. The Angels shouldn’t let him slip away.

For six and a half days, Boston College football was relevant again. Following a 41-34 road victory over Wake Forest—one that supposedly confirmed BC’s explosive start to the 2018 campaign—the Eagles cracked the AP Poll for the first time in 10 years, clocking at No. 23 in the nation. Through three weeks of play, BC was averaging 52.7 points and 577.7 yards of total offense, both good for seventh in the country. Fans even went as far to compare the 2018 Eagles to the Matt Ryan-led teams of the late 2000s—that was, until the second quarter of BC’s Week Four matchup against Purdue.

Emily Carambelas, 14, likes to look up words in the dictionary but when she looked up dyslexia, she saw a definition she did not like. Emily's Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary defined dyslexia as "the impairment of the ability to read." "That is only part of the puzzle," she says she thought at the time. "It does not explain the whole picture." She should know. Emily has dyslexia. She did something few people ever would think to do: She wrote to Merriam-Webster Inc. and asked that the definition be changed.
LONDON (REUTERS, THE TIMES, LONDON) - Two of South America's deadliest forwards are still expected to be fit for the World Cup despite a premature end to their respective domestic seasons. English Premier League champions Manchester City on Tuesday (April 17) said Argentina striker Sergio Aguero will likely miss the rest of their term following knee surgery. Aguero, who has not started a match since City's 1-0 league victory over Chelsea on March 4, injured the knee in training a month ago, and then aggravated the problem after a challenge by Ashley Young in the 2-3 loss to Manchester United on April 7.

Jeff Flake and Susan Collins supported the motion, as did Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who had been undecided. GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski voted no.
The middle child of the AMG GT Roadster range, the new S is a stunner in its own right. Believe it or not, this 2019 AMG GT S Roadster is Mercedes' tenth AMG GT variant.

That's quite a portfolio, all based on the same set of strong bones.
As musical director of Mostly Madrigals, a St. Charles choir, Jeff Hunt has tried to give shape to his boyhood dreams. "My goal was to develop a small professional choir that would be challenging," he says. "I really wanted to get together with other people who enjoyed singing." Hunt's inspiration was his experience singing in his high school choir. "Making music together was very enjoyable," he says, and he thought leading a music group might be even better. So in 1984 Hunt decided to form a choir.

RealNetworks paid about $1.25 million to its MusicNet venture for royalties and services last year, but it recouped nearly $1.6 million from the streaming-music subscription service, a regulatory filing disclosed late Tuesday. The Seattle-based multimedia company received payments of $760,000 from MusicNet for license and service agreements, as well as $620,000 for office-space rental and $217,000 for administrative services, according to a RealNetworks proxy statement submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Prosecutor Anthony Wzorck outside the U.S Courthouse at Market St. and 6th St., after the verdict was handed in on the Philadelphia Traffic Court corruption case. AFTER TWO days of deliberations, a federal jury acquitted six former Philadelphia Traffic Court judges of corruption and fraud yesterday, debunking the government's claims of judicial dishonesty and ticket-fixing. In count after count, U.S. District Judge Lawrence Stengel read "not guilty" from the verdict sheet to a packed courtroom. Sobs of relief echoed from the gallery from family and friends of former Traffic Court judges Michael Sullivan, Michael Lowry, Robert Mulgrew, Willie Singletary, Thomasine Tynes and Mark Bruno.
“The future isn’t what it used to be,” sings Zach Rogue in “Good Morning (The Future)” from Rogue Wave’s new album, Permalight. His voice sounds high and sweet and so much like Ben Gibbard’s that every time I hear it I think I’m hearing Death Cab for Cutie. And then I think, What is Gibbard doing singing a Yogi Berra line like that? But by the time my brain gets to that point, “Good Morning” has shifted into a chorus that sounds like the Shins doing a Kraftwerk impersonation.
Who Are the President’s 13 State of the Union Guests? WASHINGTON—The White House has named the guests who will be sitting with the First Lady during President Donald Trump’s second State of the Union address on Tuesday, Feb. 5. The theme of the speech is “choosing greatness,” according to a senior administration official, and Trump will hit on five major topics: immigration, protecting American workers, infrastructure, lowering health care costs, and national security. Many of the guests reflect the main areas of Trump’s speech.
We're feeling a little out of the loop here. Despite assurances from the Obama administration that millions of Americans have visited the new health insurance marketplace website, documents show that enrollment has been very slow, due to technical problems prohibiting many from signing up. According to "war room" meeting notes, only six enrollments had occurred in the first 24 hours after the launch on Oct. 1. By the end of the next day, there were 248 enrollments noted. To reach the campaign's goal of seven million by the beginning of March, there must be an average of 39,000 people signing up daily.
Did Eastern Germany Experience an Economic Miracle? The Volkswagen plant in Kassel, Germany, March, 1988. This Sunday, Germany celebrates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The festivities will be rather spectacular for a nation that remains understandably skeptical of nationalistic displays. In Berlin, starting this Friday, three days’ worth of tours, readings, and concerts are planned, all of them centered around an elaborate display of eight thousand lighted balloons that will stand along a nine-mile stretch of the city, tracing the path where the Wall once stood.
Imagine a big “ERASE” button that sat on your desk and allowed you to wipe out an embarrassing moment from the past -- a kind of metaphysical version of the Staples “Easy button.” It would be tempting to hit that button on occasion, but such a device exists only in the realm of fantasy. Some privacy advocates now want to mandate such a button for the Internet. It is unlikely that such a mechanism could be implemented, and even if it could, it would have troubling ramifications for freedom of speech, digital commerce, and Internet governance more generally.

DOWNERS GROVE – Downers Grove Grade School District 58 is expected to move ahead with the creation of a master facility plan at its Oct. 10 meeting.

Drake Gets New Tattoo of Denzel Washington's Face -- See the Pic! Drake just added one very famous fave to his tattoo collection! Toronto-based tattoo artist Inal Bersekov took to Instagram on Saturday to show off some of his latest work: a detailed portrait on the 30-year-old rapper of Denzel Washington as Bleek Gilliam in the 1990 jazz film, Mo' Better Blues. "'Mo' better blues' first session on my brother @champagnepapi, thanks as usual for your trust. "Clarke: 'Cause mo better makes it mo better," Bersekov wrote on Instagram.
It May Be Summer, But For Economists, This Week Feels Like Christmas : The Two-Way Each day this week will bring new decisions and reports that could have a big impact on the nation's economy. This week is summer's sweet spot — the peak time for pool parties, fresh-picked berries and cool drinks. But for economists, it may feel more like Christmas — so much to unwrap! Tuesday and Wednesday: The Federal Reserve Board's policymakers are meeting over two days this week to chew over economic data and decide whether to continue the current policies that restrain interest rates.
Dean Williamson has worked in the Australian Regular Army for just over seven years and knows all too well about the tough and gruelling conditions of the job. “During my time in the 5th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment we battled casualties, whether it was members shot, blasted injuries and vehicle accidents. However, in Australia the unit suffered deaths by suicides, car and motorbike accidents and training accidents,” Mr Williamson said. Each year on November 11, Australians observe one minute’s silence at 11 am in memory of those who died, suffered or fought in all wars and armed conflicts.
The Lenovo Moto Mod concept is perhaps the most popular modular smartphone concept to date and for good reason — Moto Mods are easy to use, powerful, and can add a whole lot more functionality to your device. Not only that, but Lenovo isn’t the only company that makes them — third-party developers have also added their concepts to the ecosystem and Lenovo has even run a competition for developers and entrepreneurs to create the best. Now, that competition is coming to a close and the best of the entrants each have their own Indiegogo page and there are some interesting concepts.
Perhaps he disagreed with the voice-control strategy? Whatever the reason, Sonos’ high-profile chief product officer, Marc Whitten, has streamed right out of the company he joined two years ago, in March 2014. Whitten goes after Sonos restructuring and layoffs announced a couple of weeks ago, as Sonos CEO John Macfarlane reacted to the rise of Amazon’s Echo Wi-Fi speaker, and its voice input smart assistant Alexa, as a surging success. Compared to the simplicity and convenience, if somewhat unreliable convenience, of Alexa-Echo, Sonos’ smartphone/tablet controller is clunky and slow.
GOOD HART -- The Readmond, Friendship, Cross Village Volunteer Fire and Rescue Squad will host its annual fundraising event, the RFC Mini Fair, from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. on Sunday, July 21, at the fire hall grounds on Robinson Road between State Road and M-119 in Good Hart, 12 miles north of Harbor Springs.

Josh Berk, the author of several teen and children’s books will sign his latest “Say It Ain’t So” Saturday at Moravian Book Shop. The Hanover Township, Northampton County, author will launch his novel, the second in a series of baseball-themed mysteries about seventh graders Lenny and his two friends both named Mike, from 2 to 4 p.m. The book is a follow-up to 2013’s “Strike Three, You're Dead,” which has been nominated for an Edgar Award for best juvenile fiction.
Last week, Stephen Colbert giddily shared the most salacious details about President Donald Trump from Michael Wolff’s bombshell book Fire and Fury with his Late Show audience. Monday night, he came face to face with the author. Now it’s the No. 1 book in the country and causing the president to lose his mind. Colbert also confronted Wolff about some of the discrepancies in his book—ones the critics have used to smear him as a “fiction” writer. In the foreword, Wolff says that he aimed to depict “the events I believe to be true,” as opposed to the absolute truth.
QUESTION OF THE WEEK: My wife and I follow the feng shui tips you provide. We are clutter-free, but not stress-free. Can you help us with some tips? We all can relate to stress. It’s one of the top things that people tell me they want to manage or “get rid of.” In our society, we believe that stress is “bad” and that we need to “get rid of ” or “manage” it, but we can create a new awareness from the positive aspects of stress.
John Lyon at Arkansas News Bureau provides a prepared statement from Arkansas Treasurer Dennis Milligan's attorney that confidently predicts the treasurer will be exonerated in a state Ethics Commission review of a massive ethics complaint filed by Matt Campbell, the Little Rock lawyer who publishes the Blue Hog Report. Jonathan Camp dismissed some allegations about improper campaign activities as untrue or frivolous. Camp has the defense lawyer's dilemma — a client who lacks credibility. Milligan illegally hired a relative. A publicly financed insurance fund has had to pay tens of thousands to settle complaints against Milligan for employment practices.
Accusing the Congress of adopting a "soft approach" towards terrorists and naxals, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Monday that China and Pakistan no longer indulge in adventurism as India now has a strong government led by the BJP. Addressing a rally in this steel city, the firebrand BJP leader also said that "infiltration by the Chinese army, a regular affair during the Congress-led UPA government, ended after Narendra Modi became the prime minister". "Similarly, Pakistan was chopping off the heads of our soldiers on the border during the UPA rule.
The TRN's Zach Duncan looks at the area's quarterback situations at the 11-man level. My August high school football blog has been quiet this past week. Chalk that up to a heavy workload getting our annual high school football preview section ready for publication. It comes out in two weeks and I promise it’s going to be a good one. But that drought ends today with the first of many topics – each team’s quarterback situation. It’s been mentioned before, but several quality quarterbacks graduated last year, leaving a little bit more uncertainty at the position than normal.
Four lawsuits were filed Thursday seeking to overturn results of the Nov. 3 election that would shut down 25 bars and liquor stores on the South Side. The lawsuits were filed in Cook County Circuit Court on behalf of several of the liquor businesses, as well as five residents from each of the four precincts that were voted dry in ballot measures known as local options. Under state law, Chicago voters may vote to prohibit liquor sales in entire precincts or at a specific tavern or store. Voters in the 9th Ward approved ballot measures to dry up four precincts, following a campaign led by Rev.
Donald Trump Jr. will travel to India this week to promote his family’s real-estate projects — but will also deliver a foreign-policy speech while appearing at an event with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Indian newspapers have been running full-page ads hyping the first son’s visit and the Trump Tower project in Mumbai under the headline: “Trump is here — Are You Invited?” The Washington Post reported. Starting on Tuesday, Trump Jr., 40, will be meeting with investors and business leaders in cities where the Trump Organization has real-estate projects — in Mumbai, Kolkata and the New Delhi suburb of Gurgaon.

What’s Kimi Raikkonen’s secret to Formula One longevity? He started in F1 in 2001, won the season championship in 2007 and has driven for the sport’s biggest names in Ferrari and McLaren. His name is spread all around the F1 record books. He’ll be 40 before this season ends, and he’s still at it. This season he’s with Alfa Romeo, which is the old Sauber team renamed _ the same Sauber he started with almost two decades ago. Ferrari dropped him after last season, going instead with 21-year-old Charles Leclerc of Monaco.
After one year as a starter, power-running quarterback Tim Tebow transformed the position. Over the offseason, he began to take the shape of a more traditional quarterback. The junior, who ran the ball more than twice as much as any Gator on the team last season, has been working on several key areas to not just improve in the pocket, but in his thinking. That�s where Tebow feels great quarterbacks separate themselves. �My main focus was just decision-making,� Tebow said. �You look at a Tom Brady or a Peyton Manning. They might be a little more accurate but not too much.
Once considered one of the crowning achievements of The Great Society, Medicaid is now being steadily chipped away—and patients are suffering because of it. Plagued by a poorly designed medical reimbursement process that rewards health care professionals for providing medically unnecessary care and yet doesn’t pay enough for many specialists or small providers to deal with burdensome administration, the popular program has been a target of reform for decades. With state budgets hollowed out and a budget regime that cuts investments in health to fund tax breaks for corporations, legislators are now looking to cut costs—and if there’s time, improve the quality of care.
The Little Ones kicked off their CMJ experience last night (October 16) with a performance at the NME.COM Welcome To CMJ party at Annex, the first of two shows they will play this week. Speaking to NME.COM after the show, singer Ed Reyes and guitarist Ian Moreno revealed they are gearing up for the release of their debut album ‘Morning Tide’ in the spring, which will be preceded by a slot opening for We Are Scientists in the UK before Christmas. “It was recorded by this amazing person called David Newton from The Mighty Lemon Drops. He’s from Wolverhampton.
A new passenger terminal in Malaysia is sinking, AirAsia has said, with cracks appearing in the runway and pools of water forming on the tarmac. Kuala Lumpur International Airport’s low-cost airline terminal, known as klia2, was built last year at a cost of 4 billion ringgit (£287 million). It has 68 gates and is designed to cater for 45 million passengers a year, but has come under increasing criticism over defects in its construction that its main airline blames for flight delays, increased wear and tear on planes and which it claims pose a potential safety risk.
Five stations on the East-West Line (EWL) and seven stations on the North-South Line (NSL) will close earlier, around 11pm, on Fridays and Saturdays from Nov 30 to Dec 15, SMRT said yesterday. The early closure of the stations will allow SMRT to continue with the power supply system renewal, as well as other maintenance and renewal works, the train operator said. During the affected periods, EWL services between Queenstown and Buona Vista stations will operate as a two-way shuttle with longer service intervals of up to 12 minutes.
Sir George Dyson KCVO (28 May 1883 – 28 September 1964) was an English musician and composer. After studying at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London, and army service in the First World War, he was a schoolmaster and college lecturer. In 1938 he became director of the RCM, the first of its alumni to do so. As director he instituted financial and organisational reforms and steered the college through the difficult days of the Second World War. As a composer Dyson wrote in a traditional idiom, reflecting the influence of his mentors at the RCM, Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford.
Whether your gripe involved the dirt in your mouth or the sloth-like traffic, Hankins is confident that you will be happier in year No. 2. “I think people are going to be shocked at the changes out there,” Hankins says. Some of the festival’s improvements are a result of state and local government easing up rules. Others come from first-year trial and error. Last summer, cattle grazed the location until a few weeks before the festival. “They had chummed it down to nothing,” Hankins says. The cows got chased out this year.
Deutsche Bank just sort of kind of compared Warren Buffett to Gordon Gekko. Gekko, played by Michael Douglas in the 1987 film "Wall Street," infamously told shareholders of the fictional Teldar Paper company that "Greed is good." And in a note to clients on Friday, Deutsche Bank compares Buffett's deal to acquire Kraft to something that you might imagine Gekko would do. Or at least, the firm doesn't think people would be quite so nice about the deal. Thought experiment: how would this "merger" have been reported if you swapped the popular, cuddly Warren Buffet with Gordon Gekko?
As entry-level GPS navigators go, the Garmin Nuvi 205W is still one of the best choices available for users who want speedy performance without breaking the bank. "Simple, yet effective" is probably the best way to describe Garmin's entry-level Nuvi 205W GPS device. This unit doesn't pack a lot of bells and whistles and focuses on getting the basics right, delivering a user experience that's easy for your chronically lost grandma to use. The standout feature in this new model is a new "Where am I?" option that can come in handy during an emergency.
AMARILLO, TX (KFDA) - One man has been arrested after police say they found him in possession of $762,000 worth of marijuana. Around 12:30 p.m. on Jan. 30, deputies from Potter County stopped a 2016 Yukon on I-40 W for a traffic offense. When deputies approached the vehicle, they found two subjects inside and while talking to them, they became suspicious of criminal activity. Consent was given for a search and 127 pounds of marijuana were located concealed in duffle bags. Michael Teng was arrested for possession of marijuana over 50 pounds, under 2000 pounds, a second degree felony.
Blake Downing poses for a portrait outside Appleby Hall on Saturday, April 13. Downing lost his mother when he was 14 which impacted his mental health when he moved to a new high school and eventually away from home to attend the University of Minnesota. He now meets regularly with seven other students in Appleby Hall as part Student Counseling Services which helped introduce a support system into Downing's life that he says has been "life changing." Downing’s mom, Janis, died when he was 14 from Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, a lung disease that causes scar tissue and leads to lung failure.
Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles. It was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas. That experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle. My goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends. The cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads.

Nigeria is spoken of as an economic equal to SA on the continent, at least measured by gross domestic product. But big-picture stats like GDP can be misleading. Nigeria has been battling ever since 2015, when the oil price crashed from more than $100 a barrel to below $40 a barrel, eventually settling at about $50 a barrel. Hard as it is to believe of a country with a population more than double SA’s, Nigeria is largely a single-commodity economy — relying on oil for more than 80% of its exports. It is a country of contradictions too.
The German chancellor is resisting Britain's demands to restrict the EU budget's increase to match inflation ahead of crunch talks with the EU's 27 member states later this year. That leaves Cameron in a difficult position. He was defeated by a combination of Labour MPs and 53 eurosceptic Tory backbenchers last week and is now left threatening a veto if Britain does not get its way. Other EU countries are keen to see an increase because they are net recipients. France wants to maintain high levels of agricultural payments, while poorer member states want to continue to receive structural funds to develop their infrastructure.
The PF1000U is the first ultra-short-throw projector that's both affordable and is tuned for video rather than data images. The PF1000U's weight and size—at 4 pounds 14 ounces and 4.5 by 5.2 by 11.1 inches (HWD)—make it easy to handle. They also eliminate any need to tie the projector down with wires, as you should with a big, heavy TV, to prevent it from accidentally falling over. To get a 90-inch image (measured diagonally) the front of the projector has to be just 12 inches from the screen.
Flint school water fountains back in 2016. It’s been more than four years since the water crisis struck Flint, Michigan, and residents are still reeling, particularly parents worried about the impact of lead on young children’s development. In a seeming bit of good news, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality announced Monday that the school district’s water is finally just as safe—or safer than—bottled water. Trust, however, is a problem for people living in Flint. No matter how safe the water is, some city residents won’t be so quick to believe the government again.
Southampton detectives are appealing for witnesses to a street robbery early on Sunday morning, July 15. Two men, both 21, were threatened with a knife, assaulted and robbed of cash by a group of four youths at about 4am in Berkeley Road, Southampton. Police believe the two victims met the four suspects on Waterloo Terrace, near the Rhino nightclub, and walked along Bedford Place, down Wilton Avenue and into Berkeley Road. The two victims walked in front of the four youths. When the group reached Berkeley Close, one of the four youths punched one victim and threatened him with a knife.
This is a powerful seven minute testimonial video that can save your life or the life of someone you love. It is targeted for a mature audience. Produced by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers National Operations Center for Water Safety in cooperation with the Brian and Nathan Keese Family. The opening public service announcement about water safety talks about the importance of being smart while enjoying all of the water-related activities available to everyone during the summer. So go on and have some fun out on the water, but please remember to do it safely and wear a life jacket.

When bitcoin hit $1,000, In Mean realized he made a mistake. The developer mined “a lot of bitcoin” not long after the cryptocurrency was released in 2009, but he lost all the money he might have gained in a simple mistake: failing to backup the coins. Now that a growing number of Cambodians are buying into cryptocurrency, the Cambodian developer is building and marketing a local coin aimed at helping new users understand the field and bridge some of the technology knowledge gap that allows newcomers to fall into digital scams.
Is This Bernie Sanders Tattoo What I Think It Is? Look at this avid Bernie Sanders supporter’s inner wrists. Look at how confident they are. But specifically, look at that right guy. That lil bird. Is that the same lil bird who landed on Bernie’s podium? Is it that bird, but wearing a little Bernie wig and tiny Bernie glasses in front of a brilliant socialist sun? A bird flying straight into the center of a media storm to give a message about the political revolution? A bird who got $27 from all the other birds in his tree and a few others?
David Bowie couldn’t have asked for a grander entrance in Christopher Nolan‘s finest film, The Prestige. Walking through a field of electricity, Bowie’s Nikola Tesla greets Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), conducts and produces electricity with his body, and then offers the magician a meal. Even though the real Tesla, a famous germaphobe, probably wouldn’t have shaken Angier’s hand, it’s still a wonderful exchange between the two characters. Below, Christopher Nolan remembers David Bowie and the time they spent together. The experience of having him on set was wonderful.
BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Fighting in the Shiite stronghold of Sadr City killed 23 Iraqis yesterday, hospital officials said, and the U.S. military reported five troop deaths, as April showed signs of becoming the worst month for U.S. forces in Iraq since September. At least 11 of the Iraqi deaths occurred when mortar shells landed in residential neighborhoods. Men rushed wounded children to overcrowded emergency rooms in Sadr City hospitals, on foot because of a ban on all vehicular traffic. In some parts of Sadr City, masked militiamen bearing machine guns and grenade launchers remained on the streets.
The First National Bank of Suffield is pleased to be a key part of the Suffield Chamber of Commerce's iSuffield program, a digital feed of community news and local advertising.

BOCA RATON — A familiar foe stands between Florida Atlantic and a nine-game home winning streak, as the Owls welcome Bethune-Cookman to FAU Stadium on Saturday. BOCA RATON — Nearly two years after hiring Lane Kiffin, Florida Atlantic has taken another major step in its hopes of becoming a big-time football program. BOCA RATON — Florida Atlantic will close non-conference play next season by hosting the Wagner Seahawks on Sept. 21, 2019, FAU announced in a press release on Wednesday afternoon. BOCA RATON — Nearly three weeks after first arriving at Florida Atlantic, Rafe Peavey still has one thing he’s yet to do.
Want to watch a video proving Bane’s voice was changed from early The Dark Knight Rises footage to the final release? How has the look of Captain America changed recently? Which upcoming Batman project will Warner Bros. tone down due to the Colorado shootings? Is there video of filming on the first day of The Wolverine? What did the screenwriter of Iron Man 3 have to say about the film? Are there Dark Knight Rises behind the scenes pictures you haven’t seen yet? Did you notice that The Dark Knight Rises, The Avengers and The Amazing Spider-Man all have similar endings?
As the high representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini has overseen EU foreign and security policy since November 2014. With her term coming to an end in 2019, Mark Leonard of the European Council on foreign relations asked Mogherini about the state of European security, the future of the international order, arms control and migration, besides a broad range of other issues. So far, the European Union has demonstrated an ability to maintain its unity over key issues like Brexit and the maintenance of the post-Crimea sanctions on Russia.
Of all the cliche’s in football, that has to be the most ridiculous. For if it were true, the Railwaymen may as well dig out their League Two road map right now. Saturday’s clash with MK Dons was supposed to be an ideal test of how far the Alex have come since their 6-1 mauling at the hands of Karl Robinson’s side earlier this season. And if Crewe are only as good as their last game, they have not improved a jot since that thrashing in September. Five goals separated the sides again and, like last time, it could have been worse.
Homeland Recap, Season Two, Episode 11, "In Memoriam"
Carrie's bug-eyed expression returns, along with Brody's pajama pants and a long-awaited mention of the mole. Someone get this girl a washcloth, pronto. Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison. Photograph by Kent Smith for Showtime. Apologies, people who never saw either ill-fated season of AMC’s The Killing, because even though it pains me to look back on a show clunkier than a pair of ill-fitting, steel-toed Doc Martins, there’s something about this season of Homeland that keeps bringing it back up (in more ways than one).
Wilfried Zaha and Raheem Sterling will return to England Under 21 duty next week when Stuart Pearce names a strong squad for the friendly against Sweden. Both Manchester United forward Zaha and Liverpool winger Sterling played in England’s 4-2 defeat to Sweden in November but, in a move that could offers pointers to this summer, they will return to the Under 21 level as Pearce steps up his preparations for the European Championships in Israel. Sterling’s club mate Jonjo Shelvey – who won his first senior cap against San Marino in October – will also drop down a level.
POLL: Who does tea better, the Irish or the British? Which is better - Irish tea or British tea? With the Royal Wedding happening this weekend, the eyes of the world are on Britain, with viewing parties popping up around the world, many riffing on the theme of tea parties, something many associate with the British. "Excuse me?" we thought. The Irish do tea just as well, if not better! So we're taking this question to you, the people. Who does tea better - the Irish or the British?
So you might ask yourself, “What is going on?” How can things be so bad that educators feel the need to petition? Superintendent Michael Hanson’s administration issued a mandate to all school principals, vice principals and counselors to lower the number of suspensions and expulsions districtwide using a repackaged, rhetoric-filled behavioral modification program called Restorative Justice. This Restorative Justice concept is not new. These interventions usually fail under the weight of their overexaggerated promises. This leads to an odd belief that if you decrease the number of official suspensions on paper, you can claim success regarding improved behavior.
MONTREAL—Over the summer with the kids away, construction crews have hastily been erecting temporary, metal-clad extensions to aging school buildings across Montreal, to help cope with ever-increasing enrolment. A mini baby boom in the 2000s, increased immigration and a recent influx of refugees are putting enormous pressure on the education system in the city amid recent budget cuts and rapidly deteriorating school infrastructure. Montreal’s public schools are bursting at the seams and, similarly to the highways and bridges across the province, the bill for decades of neglect has come due.
Accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, Rick Perry speaks after being sworn in as secretary of energy. On Friday, he addressed the department's employees. Keep going for a look back at Rick Perry's tenure in Texas through the eyes of Houston Chronicle editorial cartoonist Nick Anderson. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, a former Texas governor and Texas A&M University Aggies Yell Leader, said Wednesday the election of the first openly gay president of the institution's student body was "stolen" and that the student who had the most votes was disqualified through a process that "made a mockery of due process and transparency."

The National Security Agency's internal watchdog detailed a dozen instances in the past decade in which its employees intentional misused the agency's surveillance power, in some cases to snoop on their love interests. A letter from the NSA's inspector general responding to a request by Sen. Chuck Grassley, (R., Iowa), lists the dozen incidents that abused the NSA's foreign intelligence collection systems. The letter also says there are two additional incidents now under investigation and another allegation pending that may require an investigation. So now we know the answer to the question: "Who's monitoring the monitors?"
MESA, Ariz. — After an exhausted Javier Baez fell short of carrying his Cubs teammates deep into the playoffs last year, he'll try to strike a balance of leading by performance and example. "I can't do it alone," said Baez, who finished second in National League Most Valuable Player voting after producing 34 home runs, 111 RBIs and a .290 batting average. "I'm sure there are a few guys here with leadership (skills), so we'll just try to stay together and try to get the team to play more together."
THE United States has made it plain that it is largely withdrawing from the international effort to end the bitter fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Unable to convince all European allies to take active peace enforcement measures, the Clinton administration now half-heartedly endorses the idea of splitting Bosnia into loosely connected Serbian, Croatian, and Muslim provinces. US officials acknowledge that this means they have abandoned hope of maintaining an ethnically mixed Bosnian nation, and that Serbs will gain some ground seized by aggression. The Bosnian civil war "has not been resolved in the way I would have hoped," said President Clinton at a press conference last week.
The current route of the Keystone XL Pipeline through Montana could pollute the water source of 30,000 residents if it were to break or leak, according to the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation. As a precaution, the tribes plan to ask developer TransCanada to adjust the Montana route and have three alternatives in mind, said Bob McAnally, former in-house counsel for the tribes who now serves as a commissioner on the Assiniboine Sioux Rural Water Supply System. “We’re quite, quite worried about what would happen if there was a malfunction or break in that line,” McAnally said.
I will list the match, what happened for each of the categories and my prediction in parenthesis. 1. U.S. titleholder Shelton Benjamin beats R-Truth. I correctly predicted R-Truth being the opponent but was wrong on him winning the match. I'm 1-1. (Also, R-Truth was my opponent choice but he was also my should win choice). 2. Rey Mysterio beats Kane. I correctly predicted the fans picking a no holds barred match and I correctly predicted a Mysterio win. I'm 3-1 (Also, Mysterio was my should win choice.
The House of Representatives has resolved to investigate the alleged breach of the Public Procurement Act by the management of the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc, leading to the loss of N90bn by the Federal Government. Moving the motion, Soba noted that the NBET was incorporated on July 29, 2010, as a Federal Government’s company responsible for managing and administering the electricity pool of the Nigerian electricity supply industry. He added that the NBET was required under Section 15(1)(a) and (b) of the Public Procurement Act to comply fully with the Act in all its activities.
It's time for the legislative-a-go-go. It's a complicated little dance that blends egos, power plays and partisan politics. That's right, the two-week filing period for anyone seeking state office is in full swing, and candidates are releasing official campaign announcements and resignations at breakneck speed. Within the last week, Sen. Mike Burkett, a three-term Boise Democrat from District 19, announced he will retire from the Senate after this session. Media outlets hardly had time to absorb this information before Boise Democrat Rep. Nicole LeFavour announced she is running for his seat.
AUSTIN — A group of senators Tuesday targeted what it calls "partial-birth" abortions and fetal tissue donations in a bill that opponents say won't have much of an impact if passed in next year's legislative session. The bill, called the Pre-Born Protection and Dignity Act, seeks to ban a type of late-term abortion prohibited by federal law, and abortion clinics have said fetal tissue donations are rare or nonexistent in Texas. If passed, the bill would be another notch in the state's belt in its longstanding fight against abortion.
The number of children ages 5 to 17 who were diagnosed with suicidality or major self-harm more than doubled from 2008 to 2015, according to a new study based on data from 32 children's hospitals across the US. In total, there were 118,363 instances in which children were discharged from a children's hospital with a diagnosis of suicidal thoughts or serious self-harm, according to an analysis of data that included emergency and in-patient information. Children ages 15 to 17 made up more than half of those patients (59,631), while 36.9 percent (43,682) were ages 12 to 14.
The twin Harvard graduates of Facebook fame Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss just took the stage at Disrupt NY to update everyone on their recent bitcoin projects. As a reminder, the twins have been working on an exchange traded fund (ETF) under the symbol ‘COIN’ so that old-school traders can trade bitcoins on the NASDAQ OMX. The two brothers also recently announced a new bitcoin exchange called Gemini. They want to build a fully regulated and fully compliant U.S.-based exchange. According to Tyler, there is a long-standing dilemma when it comes to bitcoin exchanges — it’s either too hard or not secure enough.
African leaders seek concensus on how to resolve Cote d'Ivoire's leadership deadlock as they meet in Addis Ababa. African leaders have begun talks in the Ethiopian capital to reach a common strategy on resolving Cote d'Ivoire's political crisis and tackle other continental trouble spots. More than 20 heads of state and governments were present at the opening of the two-day African Union (AU) summit in Addis Ababa on Sunday. refusing to hand over power to Alassane Ouattara, his rival, following a presidential election. The panel would help Ouattara "exercise power" through a negotiated deal, Jean Ping, the AU commission chief, said.
This year marks the 40th anniversary of sci-fi horror classic Alien, which has since inspired a slew of sequels, prequels and played a vital part in shaping the genre since. The blockbuster franchise was even the subject of a New Jersey high school’s theatrical production, titled Alien: The Play, last month. The play became the talk of the internet and even received praise from the 1979 film’s director Ridley Scott and star Sigourney Weaver. I don’t know about you, but I’ve never wanted to attend a high school production more!
Gary Edgley gave his young Poachers the thumbs up following their 6-0 victory at Wellingborough Whitworth. As far back as September, the Boston Town boss had said it would take him until Christmas to put together a squad capable of forcing their way out of the United Counties League Premier Division’s relegation battle. And Edgley’s words are currently ringing true as they Poachers have now picked up four wins and a draw since Boxing Day’s defeat to Sleaford Town - Saturday’s success being the first time in nine years the side have won three consecutive matches without conceding a goal.
HOHENFELS, Germany -- Any parent would be proud of having their child named valedictorian of their high school, but retired Lt. Col. Reginald Bourgeois and his wife, Stephanie, can be doubly proud because for the second year in a row, one of their children has claimed the highest honor at Hohenfels Middle/High School. This year's valedictorian was Caroline Bourgeois, while the honor went to her brother Rene in 2012. "We're extremely proud … but not surprised," said Lt. Col. Bourgeois. "They can do anything they put their minds to." They put their minds to a lot.

Cheri Bustos, my favorite Democrat in Congress, has stirred things up this week with a report on how Democrats can carry rural areas that favored Donald Trump in 2016. It’s not a particularly complicated formula: focus on the economy, don’t get distracted by ancillary issues and meet people where they are. In Bustos’ case it’s strolling supermarket aisles talking to ordinary folks about their concerns. That’s classic Cheri. She gets her energy from talking to people. And, hey, I think Wisconsin’s Scott Walker may be one of the best governors in the nation.
EchoStar and MVS Comunicaciones, one of the largest media and telecommunications conglomerates in Mexico, are forming a joint venture called Dish Mexico that will launch “Dish,” an affordable satellite TV service that will be available to consumers across that nation, officials said Tuesday.

The service will be delivered via an EchoStar-provided high-powered direct broadcast satellite allowing the service to reach beyond mountains and buildings to provide affordable video options for consumers across the entire country. Financial terms of the joint venture were not released.
Marilyn Monroe may have once said ‘I don’t know who invented high heels, but all women owe him a lot’, but she had obviously never been sent home from work by her employer for refusing to wear them. Seeing as I don’t have a part-time job as a drag artist, I can’t vouch for the discomfort that wearing them entails, but I do know that I have seen many women in my surgery over many years suffering from the consequences of their high heels habit, sometimes permanently.
At Xerocon Auckland, Kiwi accounting firm Xero revealed it is teaming up with Paymark to eliminate paper receipts in New Zealand. At present, the Paymark EFTPOS network processes more than 75 percent of all electronic transactions in the New Zealand retail market. Coupled with Xero’s 138,000 New Zealand business customers, the companies are well positioned to eliminate paper receipts to small businesses and consumers. Xero and Paymark have been working in partnership on mechanisms to allow electronic receipts (eReceipts) to flow directly into accounting software and expect to have the service in market during 2015.
I get the feeling that people often like listening to the sound of their voice more than their thoughts. We’re uncomfortable with stillness. We’re uncomfortable with silence. I don’t believe that every conversation should be used to argue or talk at someone about your views. Think about the purpose of conversations: Is this conversation turning into being just for and about me? Or do I actually respect this person and what he or she has to say? Social media platforms are the greatest scene of this tragedy as the nature of posting and commenting is, at times, almost mindless.
V-League clubs Song Lam Nghe An (SLNA) and Navibank Saigon can breathe a sigh of relief now that the results of the draw of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Cup have been announced.

In the wake of a senseless tragedy at Sandy Hook elementary, many people are asking, "Where was God?" Our hearts are broken with the tragic loss of innocent life in Connecticut, and we pray daily for the God's comfort and peace for the shattered lives of the families of these victims. But still people will ask, "Why didn't God stop this?" That is a question that deserves an answer. The truth may be that God was made unwelcome and left. God submits himself to the law of faith, and will not go where he is not wanted.
Dodgers second baseman and Philadelphia baseball hero Chase Utley, center, acknowledges the Citizens Bank Park crowd before his first at-bat Monday night in the second inning. PHILADELPHIA >> For his 1,913th major-league game Monday, the most popular Phillies player of his era would have a plan. He’d play it like he did his first 1,912. In Citizens Bank Park, he knew, that would be plenty. He would play hard and he would run hard. He would take a fastball to the ribs if it meant reaching base. If necessary, he would create a collision at second base.

The second man was injured but able to dig himself out of the snow.
Syfy’s Defiance opened Season 3 with the introduction of two new kinds of lethal adversaries — both of which left their mark, as well as threatened to do further damage, by the end of the two-hour opener. WHITE SUPREMACY | On the hunt for crazy Pilar, who in the finale had left town with son Quentin, pregnant daughter Christie and son-in-law Alak, Datak, Stahma and Rafe crossed paths with General Rahm Tak aka “The Beast” (played by Oz‘s Lee Tergesen). To curry favor with (or at least avoid death at the hand of!)
The electronics giant is projecting stronger-than-expected sales this holiday even after delivering better-than-anticipated revenue in the September quarter. The only negative was another drop in iPad sales. Here's another feature found in the iPhone 6: The ability to propel Apple to another blowout quarter. The Cupertino, Calif., electronics giant on Monday reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that topped Wall Street expectations. It also projected stronger sales for the current period than analysts anticipated and sold more iPhones than anticipated. The only negative remained iPad sales, which dropped for the third consecutive quarter and fell below Mac revenue for the first time in years.

A Chinese worker walks past a new property development in Beijing. Prices for new homes in China rose in August to their highest level this year, challenging efforts by the government to cool the market while supporting one of the economy’s most robust sectors. New housing costs rose in 69 out of 70 major Chinese cities. The three largest — Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen — saw prices soar by 15-19% compared to last year, well above the national average of 8.3%, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday.

Jordan Ford, as he has for two spectacular seasons, took over at times with drives down the lane, and dribble-drive floaters that resembled Steph Curry of the Warriors. Ford had 23 points, but as the Bulldogs have shown over these last two championship-molding campaigns, he is hardly a one-man machine. Folsom is defined by teamwork and depth. Jared Wall had 16 points, and Tre Finch and Josiah Deguara had 15 each. Alec cq Andrews had three points but contributed mightily otherwise with deft passing, defense and calm. Colin Russell and Lukas Hendricks also had strong moments, even if just combining for four points.
The FCC's hopes to enforce Net Neutrality got a vicious slap from a federal appeals court which ruled that Comcast has the right to regulate what happens on its broadband network. In effect, this gives Comcast the right to punish those who use too much bandwidth such as BitTorrent users. If the decision stands, ISPs will be able to do nearly whatever they want, meter usage and charge per use. Who knows what else? This is a pretty scary deal except for one little thing -- competition. In my area, I can use Comcast, Verizon, mobile broadband or satellite.
Basking in the hot Florida sun, Shane Black‘s Iron Man 3 almost doesn’t look like an Iron Man film at all. In fact, while two superheroes manning high tech suits designed by Stark Enterprises were recently on the southern set, neither suit was the traditional red and yellow armor fans have come to know and love from the first two movies and The Avengers. Instead we have Tony Stark’s new Mark XLVII armor (first revealed at Comic-Con) and James Rhodes’ new Iron Patriot suit (first revealed through spy photos) on set together.

Quentin Tarantino did an admirable job of adapting one of Elmore Leonard's greatest works. The widely acclaimed crime novelist Elmore Leonard died at his home on Tuesday (August 20, 2013) of complications from a stroke. His novels include the Edgar Award-winning La Brava, Out of Sight and numerous stories turned into big screen movies Get Shorty and Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown. The latter tale, adapted from Leonard's Rum Punch, appeared perfect for Tarantino in his post-Pulp Fiction era, and he cleverly cast Pam Grier - the star of Coffy and Foxy Brown - in the lead role.
RIL was extremely volatile last week, whipsawing between Rs 790 and Rs 820. The stock, however, closed near the intra-week low implying that the short-term trend continues to be down. Traders can initiate fresh shorts in rallies with stop at Rs 830. Downward targets are Rs 778 and Rs 765. But a move above Rs 830 will take the stock up to Rs 848 and Rs 881. The stock is in a medium-term uptrend since the June low at Rs 673. But this rally faces a first serious hurdle at Rs 870. The stock is reversing after testing this level in September.
On party lines, the four GOP senators on the chamber’s Judiciary Committee advanced SB 1046, which would restrict how voters who sign up for the Permanent Early Voting List, known as PEVL, can cast a ballot. Current law allows them to return those ballots by mail, or hand-deliver them to election facilities at any time leading up to or on election day. Some voters like to wait until the last minute – 228,000 mail-in ballots were dropped off at polling sites on the day of the 2018 general election, according to the Secretary of State’s Office.
The department of correctional services in the Western Cape is investigating a video and images on social media of off-duty wardens in George drinking alcohol while in uniform. Department spokesperson Simphiwe Xako said on Friday that the incident had taken place in December and that the officers had been off duty. In the images, wardens are in what appears to be a parking area. Some have glasses in their hands and a three-litre box of 4th Street wine is on top of a car. Xako said the department viewed the allegations in a serious manner.
There is no coach's code, no secrets that must be kept under wraps, when the game is on the line. Past experience is updated and made current by Stuart Lancaster should it give Leinster an edge over Wasps. "It's not just about the coaches," he said, initially side-stepping the issue. The ex-England foreman has deep and meaningful knowledge about what makes players tick and blow-up. For instance, he can take the boys in blue on a walkabout inside the heads of James Haskell, Joe Launchbury and Danny Cipriani. "The Leinster players today are all in the video rooms preparing.
Tigers general manager Al Avila discussed Thursday's trade that sent Justin Verlander to the Houston Astros: "Obviously it's a sad situation." It was complex, sensitive and inevitable. It was the toughest trade of Al Avila’s career but also the easiest trade, one that will largely play into his legacy as the Detroit Tigers’ general manager. And as noon approached today at Comerica Park, with the Justin Verlander trade not even 12 hours old, it still was a shock to fans who have claimed Verlander as one of their own for the past 12 seasons.
Lawn sweepers are more efficient and less time consuming than raking leaves. 3 What Kind of Rake to Use for Grass Seed? Lawn sweepers operate with brushes underneath that pick up lawn debris and flip it into a hopper. The process is the same as a vacuum cleaner, but the brushes turn manually as you push a walk-behind sweeper. You may use a lawn sweeper to clean the yard after mowing it, or to clean fallen leaves and debris. An accumulation of dead grass and leaves on your lawn blocks sunlight and air from the grass and can kill the lawn.
SOUND FORGE Audio Cleaning Lab can be used to record any sound you can hear on your computer - from internet radio to LPs and tapes which have been connected to the sound card. When recording older material, particularly when it has been stored on vinyl or cassette, it is likely that the sound quality has deteriorated over time.

Of course, you don't need to record audio either.
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added 162,000 jobs in July, a modest increase and the fewest since March. Still, the unemployment rate fell to a 4½-year low of 7.4 percent, a hopeful sign. Unemployment declined from 7.6 percent in June because more Americans found jobs, and others stopped looking and were no longer counted as unemployed. Still, Friday's report from the Commerce Department pointed to a less-than-robust job market. It suggested that the economy's subpar growth and modest consumer spending are making many businesses cautious about hiring.
Texas Department of Public Safety officials have identified the woman who died in an SUV rollover north of Bushland on Sunday night. About 7:45 p.m., Judith Jackson, 49, of Houston, was driving a 2003 Chevy Suburban northbound on Farm-to-Market Road 1061 near mile marker 96 when she lost control of the vehicle, driving through a barbed wire fence into a vacant field before the SUV rolled several times, coming to rest on its tires, officials said. Jackson was pronounced dead on the scene. She was wearing her seat belt, officials said.
NORMAL — Deja vu washed over St. Thomas More volleyball in two waves Friday afternoon. The first arrived as the Sabers dropped the opening set of their Class 2A state semifinal bout with Pleasant Plains at Redbird Arena.

As a junior with the St. Thomas More volleyball program, her class accounted for seven of 15 team members on the eventual state-champion Sabers.
One of the more contentious debates in homeland security over the past several years has concerned fusion centers—state and local run organizations dedicated to information sharing and analysis. These centers, which are funded by state and local governments but also receive federal support, have raised concerns with civil libertarians who argue that they threaten civil rights. These centers have also rankled good government advocates who question their effectiveness. But while fusion centers certainly saw their share of shortcomings in their early years, they’ve made substantial progress since then and now play an important role in addressing problems identified after the 9/11 attacks.

They have to wear a suit and tie practically everyday and are only permitted to use the phone to call their parents, but even then only on Christmas and Mother's Day. Interaction between sexes is limited, so dating is out and even flirting isn't allowed, but then dating would be hard when spending nearly every minute with one or two other guys. This is the life 19-year-old Drew Loughran signed up for for the next two years when he decided to complete a mission trip with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

Duke University Press (DUP) claims it "supports the academic mission of Duke University by disseminating knowledge" and by contributing "most significantly to the University's ... commitment to learning, freedom, and truth." When it comes to Israel, however, DUP engages in an increasingly troubling anti-Israel agenda that may violate its mission. In November, DUP published "The Right to Maim: Debility, Capacity, Disability" by Jasbir Puar, a member of the Advisory Board of the U.S. Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel.
European online retail sales are expected to hit €191 billion ($249 billion USD) in 2017, up from €112 billion ($146 billion USD) in 2012, according to new data published today by Forrester. The forecast, which looks at 17 countries across Europe, estimates an 11 percent compound annual growth rate, fueled by the usual advantages of shopping online, such as saving time, money and finding products that simply aren’t available offline. Despite their poor economic outlook at the moment, Forrester predicts that much of this growth will be attributed to Spain and Italy.

Freeport, The Bahamas - Photographer and resident of Grand Bahama Island, Donald Pecora captured this beautiful image of the sunset over the container port area of Freeport today which was taken from an apartment deck in the Coral Beach vicinity. The photographer was surprised he could even see that far from the south side of the island. When asked by The Bahamas Weekly whether he'd altered his shot in any way he responded, "I just zoomed in and sharpened up! And the sun was behind this huge cloud in the background until just before settling. I never knew we could see the port before this."
3-D printing technology, used industrially for the last few decades, is poised to break into the mass market. Its endless and swiftly developing possibilities -- from entrepreneurial manufacturing to the potential sculpting of human organs -- could become the next industrial revolution. When the TV series Star Trek first brought the starship Enterprise into German living rooms, the concept of a replicator was pure science fiction, a fantastical utopian vision we might experience one day centuries in the future. Replicators, something of a mixture between computer and miniature factory, were capable of creating food and replacement parts from next to nothing.
Fate Therapeutics has wowed people with its big plans to make drugs that activate adult stem cells in the body to treat diseases and regenerate tissues. And now the biotech startup has brought on new scientific talent to help put its first treatment to the test in clinical trials. Fate said yesterday it has recruited Ken Batchelor, a former senior research executive at drug giant GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), to be its chief scientific officer. Batchelor is said to be one of the scientists who invented the urology drug dutasteride (Avodart), a treatment that shrinks oversized prostates and generated $547.9 million in 2008 revenue for London-based Glaxo.
King tried not to weep when he mentioned how some of these people who have fallen victim to these “senseless” crimes have been friends of his, friends who now have to be buried. King took a moment to remind residents of the days not that long ago when he, as a child, was allowed to play outside without worry of being shot or robbed or injured. King said he’s preparing to hire a police chief as soon as possible. Former Chief Calvin Hutchins resigned, the latest in a string of police chiefs to step down after briefly serving the city over the years.
Tyler Baltierra Gushes Over Catelynn Lowell Following Cheating Scandal! Looks like Tyler Baltierra and Catelynn Lowell are still going strong! The Teen Mom OG star posted a loving message to his wife following the bombshell cheating scandal. "God I love her," the reality star wrote on his Twitter page, retweeting a funny video that Cate posted on her Instagram. Just last week, Tyler and Cate were in the midst of an explosive cheating scandal after a blind item on Crazy Days and Nights claimed that he was unfaithful in their marriage. The couple then took to Twitter to shut down the accusations.
File Businessman Patrick Powell enters a BMW X5 motor vehicle after walking free from the Supreme Court on Monday. Former attorney general Patrick Atkinson who defended Patrick Powell in the 'X6 murder trial' said the court of public opinion unfairly convicted his client. Powell, a businessman, was yesterday freed of murder and shooting with intent in relation to the death of 17-year-old Kingston College student Khajeel Mais. "There are many cases where I hear the public have convicted a person, and when you look at the evidence it is clear that they were innocent," Atkinson said.

SALISBURY player-manager Darrell Clarke is not ruling out throwing himself into the heat of battle when his side face Sheffield United today. Clarke’s Blue Square Bet South charges are the lowest-ranked side in the competition, but he will do whatever it takes to spring a surprise on his former boss Danny Wilson. Asked if he will select himself against a side 84 league positions above his, Clarke, above, said: “That’s the million-dollar question. What I will say is I won’t be playing just because it’s Sheffield United, I’ll be playing because I need to.
Recently, not only in some of the opinion letters written to the Daily American, but just in casual conversations with people have I heard such appalling statements about people elected to serve our country. In only the case of President Obama, I've heard words like communist and evil used to describe him. I've also heard multiple racial slurs, and attacks on how he apparently is Islamic (which he evidently is not). Who cares if he even was a Muslim? Does it really affect you or your way of life?
ISLAMABAD: The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of a drought-like situation in Sindh and parts of Balochistan, highlighting that the condition may become severe in the coming days as a dry spell is predicted in many parts of the country. A report of the NDMA containing short-term and long-term recommendations and measures has been submitted to the president and the Prime Minister Office. The report has also been shared with the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), Sindh, and other stakeholders for necessary action. The NDMA is the lead federal agency tasked with mitigating and countering the impact of natural disasters.
WASHINGTON - Only about half of the veterans diagnosed with PTSD last year after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan received the recommended therapy despite efforts by the Department of Veterans Affairs to beef up its mental health staffing, the Institute of Medicine said in a report released Friday. About 53 percent of the veterans whose primary diagnosis was PTSD got at least eight psychotherapy sessions within a 14-week period in 2013. But that is significantly short of the department's target of 67 percent, according to the report. The Institute of Medicine also found issues with the way active members of the military dealing with PTSD are treated.

Energy firms likely to miss smart meter deadline, warns Which? Large energy suppliers will need to triple the number of smart meters they are installing to meet a 2020 deadline, consumer group Which? has warned. It said firms would need to install 30 smart meters a minute, every day, for the next two years to replace the 46 million existing meters. At present, large energy suppliers are only putting in 9.7 meters a minute. Smart Energy GB said suppliers "are working hard to offer all households smart meters as soon as possible".
In my last post, I discussed how the gap between the web and enterprise-computing worlds has narrowed. Some of the Valley’s developers are now building web-based systems that make old-world transaction processing seem like child’s play. After all, Twitter processes more transactions per day (in the form of messages) than the systems of many large corporations process in a month. Applications that would take years to design and develop can now be built in weeks. I called on Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to rescue the California government—to help rebuild its legacy systems.

A “living classroom” project on Trunk Island, in Harrington Sound, is being supported by LOM Financial, which has committed to donating $50,000 to the Bermuda Zoological Society during the next five years. Scott Lines, chief executive officer of the financial services company, said: “Through making this gift, LOM is pleased to support BZS’s vision for a ‘living classroom’ at Trunk Island that will not only give all children a true experience of Bermudian living, but also educate them on our island’s diverse and rich ecosystem.
The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has promoted eight Assistant Route Commanders to Deputy Route Commanders in the Gombe State Sector Command. Sector Commander Galadima Kuteb, who decorated them yesterday, said the promotion was in recognition of their hard work. The commander urged other officers to be patient and work hard. Responding for the others, Deputy Route Commander Rimaskwe Gideon Kitan said “promotion is about hard work, commitment and dedication,” and sought the cooperation of everyone towards the goal of saving lives. State Sector Commander Kuteb hailed the conduct of road users during the Sallah celebration.
LIONEL MESSI has told Barcelona they must not let Chelsea target Sergi Roberto leave the club. The Catalans lost 2-0 to Real Madrid in the Supercopa last night. According to Spanish news outlet Don Balon, Messi has demanded no more first-team stars leave the club. Don Balon say Chelsea are firmly in the hunt for Roberto - and it's claimed they're willing to pay his £37.5m release clause. Roberto did feature for Barca last night due to Andres Iniesta's injury. However, he wasn't selected for the first-leg and Paulinho's arrival at the club could limit his game time even further.
In January 2015, the audit firm Nexia BT – the agents for Mossack Fonseca in Malta who serviced the Prime Minister’s chief of staff and energy minister to open offshore companies in Panama – enrolled a host of new companies. They belonged to a man called Manuchehr Ahadpur Khangah, an Azerbaijani national who hails from Iran, with address in Dubai. MaltaToday had already written about the businessman: the polo enthusiast and poker player, 63, was the chairman of the AZ Group of Companies, which has interests in the food, plastics, wood, and construction industries.

MANHATTAN (CN) – How — and where — should victims collect reparations for a genocide? In New York, an effort to hold present-day Germany responsible for what is grimly called the first genocide of the 20th century hit a setback. The case was brought by indigenous Ovaherero and Nama and descendants of the estimated 100,000 people who were systematically killed by colonizing Germans between 1904 and 1908 in what is now Namibia. Ruben Carranza, senior expert on reparations for the International Center for Transitional Justice, noted that U.S. courts have become a resource for survivors of dictatorships, war criminals and genocides.

Want to study abroad? Check out America. Agrowing staple on the menu of most colleges and universities is the opportunity to study abroad, through which a student earns credits by traveling to a foreign land for coursework or a special project assignment. It’s a fine idea. The lives and careers of today’s young people will be inextricably bound up with global events. Simply to be a knowledgeable, effective citizen will require a grasp of previously unfamiliar places and some practice mixing and empathizing with the people who inhabit them.
The participants in Recycled Runway re-purpose thrown away items into chic fashion. For the latest trends in fashion, some local students are looking no further than their own recycling bins. Participants from middle and high school will send their designs across the stage of the Boulder Theater on April 12 in the seventh annual Recycled Runway fashion show. The profits of this year’s show will be donated to Blue Sky Bridge, a local child and family advocacy center. A total of 26 competitors have been using the independent study workshop in the Common Threads Creative Lab to create garments made entirely from recycled materials for the show.
Three giant trees growing in the grounds of Downing College are facing the axe – because they are damaging one of its historic buildings. The London Planes have been growing near the West Range for about 50 years, and their roots have crept deep under the building that houses staircases A, B and C.
The displacement of soil caused by the roots, coupled with moisture being sucked out of the ground, has caused cracks in the building and twisted door frames out of shape. Now the college has applied to the city council for permission to fell the trees.

Recently, social media took on an even greater importance in the fashion world when Vivien Models manager Catherine McGill revealed that an increasing amount of brands are refusing to consider any models whose followers count dips below 10,000. This eyebrow-raising incident only seems possible in the wake of social media stars-turned-models Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid, whose meteoric rises in fashion are due as much to their built-in followings as they are to their looks. Over the past year, since the pair simultaneously made their runway debuts at New York Fall 2014 Fashion Week, they’ve booked high-profile jobs based on their followers count.
Bill Clinton is rumored to be in the running for the next ambassador to Ireland. The nation’s 42nd president may well be rewarded for his ferocious campaigning for Barack Obama and other Democrats during the election season, The Christian Science Monitor reports. While on his third trip to Ireland this year — this one in November — Clinton quipped, “I could run for president of Ireland,” if only he owned a home there, The Monitor reports. No word yet from the White House — or even Clinton’s wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
In an effort to reach past its traditional audience base, Sci Fi Channel will offer programming with a more human than alien touch. A softer on-air look and new series and specials that deal with supernatural occurrences here on Earth will occupy more of Sci Fi&apos;s programming lineup over the next year in an effort to broaden its audience beyond, well, male science-fiction geeks. movies into a purveyor of quality acquired and original programming that spans the broad definition of the science-fiction genre, said president Bonnie Hammer. helped the channel match its best monthly performance ever with a 1.0 primetime rating in August.
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state oil firm PDVSA has resumed crude imports for its 335,000-barrel-per-day Isla refinery in the Caribbean island of Curacao after a seven-month pause, as it seeks to turn around falling fuel output, according to internal PDVSA documents. PDVSA, which supplies the bulk of Venezuela’s export revenue, is increasingly in need of foreign crude as chronic underinvestment slashes its own output, leaving it short of crude to refine and blend. The increased activity at Curacao comes as more suppliers are accepting oil swaps as a solution to the company’s lack of dollars, according to the documents.

The old vertically integrated industrial giants are gone, replaced by supply chains. And as a result, the transfer-pricing smoke and mirrors have gone as well, and we can begin to see where real profits are made. Some years ago, a Taiwanese take on this was that the potential for profits was concentrated at the ends of the supply chain (in R&D and product design, and in dealing with end customers ) with no room for profits in actually making things. Apple’s cash mountain would seem to indicate that designing things and outsourcing their actual production can work very nicely, thank you.
The Boston Red Sox weren’t able to extend their six-game winning streak Sunday afternoon, as the Seattle Mariners avoided the series sweep with a 5-0 victory at Fenway Park. While Seattle’s run total wasn’t overwhelming, the visiting club had great success against Red Sox starting pitcher Rick Porcello. The Mariners jumped all over Boston’s ace, collecting 11 hits over the 6 1/3 innings he was on the mound. Porcello did a good job of limiting the damage to only two earned runs during his outing, but the reigning American League Cy Young winner wasn’t pleased with his performance Sunday.
FORT PIERCE — Fort Pierce Westwood stayed perfect in district play on Friday night, but the Panthers had to stop a fake on a potential game-winning field goal in the final minute to preserve the win. John Carroll Catholic chose to run a fake field goal with 34 seconds remaining instead of attempting a 38-yarder, but the Westwood defense broke up the trickery, hanging on for a 21-19 victory over the Rams at McGuire Field. John Carroll started on its own 14 with 5:29 remaining and moved into Westwood territory but was left with a fourth-and-8 after reaching the Panthers’ 20.
When Danna Schaeffer hears that one of her friends has welcomed a new grandchild, she’s happy for them. But she feels awkward, too. The theatrical piece, which contains elements of memories, wisdom and loss as well as humor, is coming to the Lounge Theatre for six shows as part of the Hollywood Fringe Festival, from Sunday, June 3 through Sunday, June 17. It’s one of the nearly 400 productions presented by local, national and international arts companies and independent performers in dozens of spaces throughout central Hollywood during the festival’s run.
The 17-year-old shot to death Wednesday night in the 1600 block of Frenchmen Street has been identified by the Orleans Parish coroner's office as Lance Zarders of New Orleans. Police officers sent to that location after getting a 9 p.m. call about a man shot there found Zarders lying in the street with multiple gunshot wounds. He was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency medical technicians, according to John Gagliano of the coroner's office. A dark-colored van was seen leaving the area after the shooting, police said. Homicide detective Anthony Pardo is investigating.
ARSENAL should be considered Premier League title contenders for THREE reasons, claims Jim White. The Gunners lost their opening two games of the season but have since gone on to record 10 consecutive wins in all competitions. Arsenal are now being talked about as realistic Premier League contenders this term. And White believes the fact Unai Emery's side are fitter than last season, are scoring more than their top-four rivals and have a thriving attacking front three means they should rightly be talked about as potential champions. “I think I’m on the money with this,” he said on talkSPORT.
In an open letter to the secretary, the whistleblower said agency officials sought to discredit her. Former Senate staffer James Wolfe pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to lying to the FBI. The agent contacted the journalist as the Trump administration was ramping up its investigations of unauthorized leaks to reporters. Staff sought out used furniture in department’s basement while ordering new dining set. The official wrote in an email that she had to answer ‘endless questions about why I won’t fund more than the $5000 limit’ for the project. Evangelical relief worker Ken Isaacs has a history of controversial remarks on Twitter.
A coalition of countries battling Islamic State jihadists in Syria and Iraq pledged Wednesday to pour more resources into the fight, after coming under strong pressure from Washington for greater contributions. The promise came after a meeting in Stuttgart of defence ministers from countries involved in the anti-IS coalition, during which US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter drove home the message that to deal IS a body blow, "all must do more". Carter's call to step up the fight came a week after US President Barack Obama reiterated a long-standing demand for members of NATO to increase their defence spending to meet the alliance's target of two percent of output.
It is early in the a.m., and since I woke up thinking about your letter, it seemed like a good time to reply. I don’t really love the morning, despite the fact that my kids have to be on the school bus (now my 13-year-old takes the city bus) by 7:10. While this may seem unusual to anyone living in the suburbs, I feel both blessed and liberated not being the family chauffeur. City living, as many working women are beginning to understand, provides much more flexibility and precious time than the suburban commuter life.
OKLAHOMA CITY - Kevin Durant scored 25 points, James Harden added a spark with 23 points off the bench while returning from an injury and the Oklahoma City Thunder ended a string of futility against the Houston Rockets with a 122-104 victory. The Thunder got out to a sizzling start and opened a 23-point lead within the first 14 minutes. Their lead was never in jeopardy against a Houston team desperately needing a late charge to make the playoffs. Instead, Oklahoma City used its second-best shooting performance of the season to take a big step toward solidifying its spot in the postseason.

Bon-Ton, Chambersburg Mall's last remaining major department store, is closing, leaving business owners and local shoppers to wonder what's ahead. Bright red-and-yellow signs scream "entire store on sale" and "store closing" at the entrance of what will soon be yet another former department store at Chambersburg Mall. The Bon-Ton is the only remaining major department store at the mall, and it is expected to close its doors in the next 10-12 weeks, in late June or early July, according to the mall's general manager, Dan May.
From major anniversaries to civil rights groups calling for moratoriums on new charter schools, the summer of 2016 was a busy one for school choice. And because it's easy for a story or two to slip under the radar while on summer vacation, I've compiled a list of some of the most notable events from the last three months. Consider this a cheat sheet to start the school year informed on all things school choice. June marked 25 years since the nation's first charter school law was signed into existence in Minnesota.
Google hasn't unveiled their new Chromebook Pro laptops yet, an expected high-end Chromebook unveiling that is meant to arrive later this month. Before that, Samsung has accidentally teased the Chromebook Pro on their own website, but it was quickly edited and removed - after Chrome Unboxed managed to get some system specs. Codename Kevin is Google's purported Chromebook Pro, which features a 12.3-inch touchscreen with a resolution of 2400x1600 (234 PPI, 400 nets, 3:2 ratio) that is a Lenovo Yoga-like device with the screen capable of being rotated 360 degrees, turning it into a 12.3-inch tablet.
Energy prices, environmental concerns and quest for freedom drive people to go "off-grid"
London, England (CNN) -- You won't hear much about it in the vast conference halls of the Copenhagen climate change summit, but living "off-grid" -- beyond the water and power lines that intersect much of the modern world -- could hold a solution to some of the planet's worst environmental woes. Initially adopted by hippies and environmental mavericks, the pioneering lifestyle has grown to attract thousands of devotees who choose to live completely independently of the local utilities power grid and instead generate their own electricity and water.
Great writers often shape our impressions of a place. Steinbeck and Dust Bowl Oklahoma, for instance. Sometimes a writer might even define a place, as Hemingway did for 1920s Paris. Rarely, though, does a writer create a place. Yet that is what the Indian poet and Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore did with a town called Shantiniketan, or “Abode of Peace.” Without Tagore’s tireless efforts, the place, home to a renowned experimental school, would not exist. For Indians, a trip to Shantiniketan, a three-hour train ride from Kolkata, is a cultural pilgrimage.
A post on TomCat's blog. Saying goodbye to Injustice Kennedy. Thank you, Furies for looking into this..and Joanne for this great post. May the Furies and All the Gods and Goddesses have mercy on us. Please see my comment there. Yikes...why did it have to happen now??? Agree with Sue and Pat. I think this was another trump plot. Kennedy showed his true colors, but I think trump bought this seat, I hope it becomes part of Mueller's extended investigation, or another special counsel.
It is possible more people who came in contact with a man who died from the Ebola virus in Dallas, Texas, could test positive for the virus in the coming days, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday. Tom Frieden offered this possibility a day after a preliminary diagnosis showed that a health care worker who had “extensive contact” with Thomas Eric Duncan tested positive for Ebola. If the test is confirmed, this would be the first known case of Ebola being contracted or transmitted in the United States.

NEW YORK (AP) — Krispy Kreme shareholders got caffeine boost after coffee giant JAB Beech said Monday it is acquiring the doughnut chain. The Luxembourg-based investment firm, which owns Keurig Green Mountain, Peet's Coffee & Tea and Caribou Coffee, said it is taking the North Carolina doughnut company private in a deal worth about $1.35 billion. Krispy Kreme's stock soared more than 24 percent in morning trading.

An All-Star Game is also set on the penultimate day of the event on March 23.
Landlords borrowed more to buy houses in the first three months of this year than first-time buyers, the first time this has happened since the financial crisis. Buy-to-let investors’ (BTL) new purchases accounted for 21pc of all loans in the first quarter, compared with 16.9pc for first-time buyers, according to the Bank of England. The last time landlords were bigger mortgage borrowers than new buyers was in early 2008, in the depths of the financial crisis. By value, the figures indicate BTL investors borrowed £13.5bn in the three-month period, while first-time buyers took out £10.8bn of mortgages.
Phillies pitcher Zach Eflin started his season on a strong note at Nationals Park Tuesday night, not giving up a hit until the fourth inning. He left for a pinch-hitter in the sixth but struck out nine Nationals. WASHINGTON — Gabe Kapler noticed how much in command Zach Eflin was on the mound Tuesday night in what became an 8-2 Phillies win over the Washington Nationals. The Phillies manager also noticed how cool his starting pitcher was at the plate in the fourth inning. It was there that Eflin, following the second of what would be three consecutive intentional walks to Maikel Franco, loading the bases with two outs.
It is so well hidden you would never notice it was there - but it could cost you thousands of pounds. Police have discovered a tiny camera hidden in ATM machines that records unsuspecting members of the public's credit card details. Hidden within a false cover on the machine, the pinhead-sized camera enables fraudsters to film people entering their pin numbers. The device was discovered at a cashpoint in St Paul's Churchyard in the City of London on 18 February. Two weeks later, a similar device was removed from another nearby ATM by a member of the public.
A cyberspy group using tools similar to those of U.S. intelligence agencies has embedded spy and sabotage firmware in systems and networks in countries including Iran, Russia, Pakistan and China, a report by security vendor Kaspersky Lab claims. Kaspersky said that the tools can’t be combated by antivirus products and are also able to stealthily obtain a computer’s encryption keys in order to read otherwise protected data. Google may have backed off from Glass, but Sony is moving ahead with plans to get its own specs into the hands of developers.
JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Attorneys for a man who was declared dead and later charged in the kidnapping of a Las Vegas girl are asking a judge to dismiss one of the indictments against him. Thomas Steven Sanders was indicted in 2010 for kidnapping resulting in the death of Lexis Roberts, whose body was found about a month earlier in Catahoula Parish in Louisiana. A second indictment in January 2011 added the charge of using a gun in a crime resulting in death. Sanders was declared dead in Mississippi in 1994 after abandoning his family.
A wildlife photographer is taking legal action to reclaim the copyright on a selfie that a cheeky monkey took using his camera. British photographer David Slater was on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi in 2011 to snap the crested black macaque when one of the animals made off with his camera. One of the "selfies" taken by a macaque monkey. Mr Slater recovered the camera to discover hundreds of "selfies", including one of a grinning female macaque. The remarkable image quickly spread around the world, appearing on websites, newspapers, magazines and television shows.
WASHINGTON — Americans are eating more shrimp than ever — about three times more than 35 years ago, Consumer Reports says — but that means shrimp is coming from many more places than in the past. And some of those sources may not follow the safest, cleanest procedures. About 94 percent of American shrimp is imported, the magazine says. And most of that shrimp is grown in farms — huge man-made tanks into which shrimp are densely packed and fed foods that may be laced with antibiotics. That can lead to unsanitary conditions if farmers aren’t careful.
As top tips on how to make-do-and-mend go, they are certainly eccentric, in the best aristocratic tradition. Lady Rawlings, chatelaine of Westgate Hall, a Sir John Soane mansion in 38 acres of prime north Norfolk, has this week been sharing with Tatler readers the secrets of how she keeps her household bills down. These include providing Panama hats instead of a marquee for summer parties, reusing the linen napkins from breakfast at luncheon, and recycling the crusts from the night before’s melba toast to make soldiers for her dippy egg in the morning.

On last summer’s Television Critics Association press tour, Showtime President and CEO David Nevins said he expected to film the series Purity in 2017. That would have been in the can before star Daniel Craig would be needed for another James Bond film, should he even decide to make one. Now that Bond 25 is scheduled for release in 2019, with filming next year and Craig expected (though not officially confirmed) to return, Showtime is waiting for him. The schedule for Bond 25 could mean that Craig is not available to shoot Purity until 2019.

The Senate in Paraguay has voted to impeach President Fernando Lugo. Both houses of Congress voted on Thursday to begin impeachment proceedings over his handling of clashes between farmers and police last Friday in which at least 17 people died. Vice-President Federico Franco has been sworn in as president. He will serve until the end of Mr Lugo's five-year term in 2013. The BBC reports the Colorado and Liberal parties put aside their differences and voted in favour of the motion to begin the impeachment trial. The Liberals are part of Mr Lugo's ruling coalition. Mr Lugo was elected in 2008.
It's estimated 35,000 people have been displaced by an upsurge in fighting around the Syrian city of Aleppo. It's one of five areas where government forces have launched offensives since Russia began supporting their operations with airstrikes at the end of September. In a speech at Buckingham Palace, Queen Elizabeth has described the emerging relationship between China and the UK as a global partnership. She said the state visit of China's president Xi Jinping, is a defining moment. A year ago the beard of Tutankhamun in a museum in Cairo was accidently knocked off. It was then very hastily reattached amid much controversy.
African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina (left) meets with David Makhura, Premier of Gauteng Province in South Africa. Gauteng Province will host the Bank’s inaugural Africa Investment Forum from November 7-9, 2018 at the Sandton Convention Center in Johannesburg.

“There is more repression of individual freedom here that in any other country we’ve been to, the police patrol the streets carrying rifles and demand your papers every few minutes, which some of them read upside down. The atmosphere is tense and it seems a revolution may be brewing. The countryside is in open revolt and the army is powerless to suppress it.” A young Ernesto Che Guevara was traveling around South America and, in a letter to his mother – dated June 1952 – used these words to describe Colombian state during La Violencia (1948-1958).

Mary Harvey is used to blazing the trail in sports. Despite growing up without major soccer tournaments to aspire to play in, the goalkeeper helped the U.S. win the inaugural Women’s World Cup in 1991 and the first women’s Olympic soccer title five years later. Today, that desire has made her one of the biggest campaigners for human rights through sports. After starting her career as a consultant in the private sector, Harvey led development work at FIFA from 2003-08, helping formulate a human rights strategy for the successful 2026 World Cup bid by the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Security researchers found a macOS version of the X-Agent malware used by the APT28 cyberespionage group. Security researchers have discovered a macOS malware program that’s likely part of the arsenal used by the Russian cyberespionage group blamed for hacking into the U.S. Democratic National Committee last year. The group, which is known in the security industry under different names, including Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, and APT28, has been operating for almost a decade. It is believed to be the sole user and likely developer of a Trojan program called Sofacy or X-Agent.
Representatives W. Henson Moore and John B. Breaux will meet in a runoff Nov. 4 as Mr. Moore fell short in his bid Saturday to be the first Republican from Louisiana to serve in the United States Senate in more than a century. With 3,054 of 3,245 precincts, or 94 percent, in Saturday's open primary reporting, Mr. Moore had 495,580 votes, or 45 percent, and Mr. Breaux, a Democrat, 410,170, or 37 percent. The nearest competitor among the rest of the 14 candidates had just over 70,000 votes. Had Mr. Moore won a majority of the vote, he automatically would have won the seat.
America is looking for ways to stop an epidemic of mass shootings in schools and other places. We’re the only developed country to have this problem. But there are some solutions. So it makes perfect sense for Massachusetts to have a law that requires gun permit applicants to complete a four-hour safety course, provide character references from two people, consent to be fingerprinted at a local police office and undergo an interview with an officer. If police believe the applicant is a threat, they can deny the permit — though the burden of proof is on the authorities to justify that decision.
Before UFC women’s champ Ronda Rousey became the face of women’s MMA (mixed martial arts), Gina Carano was poised for greatness… until she was defeated by Cristiane “Cyborg” Justino in 2009 with the promotion Strikeforce. Since then, she’s focused on her acting career, most notably appearing in 2013’s Fast & Furious 6. Carano, however, is still under contract with the UFC through her old Strikeforce contract and has four fights remaining on that contract. So, will she ever return? During an appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show, she said a comeback is likely.
Despite the critique we have offered in the past, Zanu PF in its recently launched manifesto, insist on claiming that its vision is for Zimbabwe to be a middle-income country (MIC) by 2030. This is a bland and banal statement which requires qualification, quantification and supporting details for it to be meaningful. What does that vision statement even mean? The MIC nomenclature is a World Bank analytical tool that refers to economies with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ranging from $1 005 to $12 235. This is too broad a grouping.
Graveside service for Marie E. Griess, 57, Amana will be held at 11 a.m., Thursday, April 19, at the Amana Cemetery. She passed away peacefully with her family at her side on April 15, 2018, after a courageous battle with cancer. Elder Alan Trumpold will officiate at the service.

WASHINGTON — Three human rights groups on Wednesday urged President Obama to pardon Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who leaked secret documents about National Security Agency surveillance in 2013 and is living in Russia as a fugitive from criminal charges. The start of the campaign coincides with the theatrical release this week of the movie “Snowden,” a sympathetic, fictionalized version of his story by the director Oliver Stone. Together, the film and the campaign, called “Pardon Snowden,” opened a new chapter in the debate about the surveillance Mr. Snowden revealed and about whether his leaks will go down in history as whistle-blowing or treason.
Aspen Skiing Co. employees are breathing easier now that word is out that mandatory fitness tests for roughly 1,500 on-slope workers aren’t so tough. “I have definitely noticed the apprehension level dropping,” said Alisa Vetter, coordinator of Skico’s Mind, Body, Spirit program. One component of that program is the Work Ready fitness test. It is mandatory this season for ski patrollers, ski instructors, lift operators and other mountain-operations workers. More than 800 employees had been tested as of Thursday, and fewer than 1 percent of them had failed, Vetter said.
The NYPD is looking for four suspects who allegedly beat a 28-year-old transgender woman in Bushwick over the weekend. The victim was attacked Saturday around 11:20 p.m. in front of 1250 Bushwick Ave. near Weirfield Street. The four men approached the victim from behind and made “anti-gay statements,” police said.

The NYPD is investigating the assault as a hate crime. The police released a surveillance video showing two of the suspects on Wednesday.
JOHN MAJOR'S government has decided to buck European trends by privatizing large chunks of the loss-making state train network, British Rail. BR sources say Mr. Major's plans, announced July 14, for shunting key components of BR into the private sector and asking them to operate there profitably assume that in future only 0.12 percent of gross national product (GNP) will be spent on Britain's train network. In France, Spain, and the Netherlands an average 0.7 percent of GNP is spent on state-owned railways. Only in Germany is there an official intention to privatize the entire national rail system.
“We have a movement going on the likes of which has never been seen in this country,” he said. Trump’s sometimes wandering speech paused several times when protesters rose, yelled at the stage and then found themselves shouted down by the Republican’s supporters as police walked them from the theater. “We’ve had an interesting couple of days,” Trump said as he began speaking in Kansas City, referring to the canceled Chicago speech and a man who rushed the stage at his first stop Saturday at a Dayton, Ohio, aircraft hangar.
Many Americans can't be bothered to watch foreign films. The subtitles, you know. Luckily, Hollywood is always ready to jump in with an unnecessary remake. TIME picks the best of the bunch. Fans of Swedish coming-of-age teen-vampire movie (and if a film ever defied categorization, it’s this one) Let the Right One In (2008) passionately swear by it and would likely swear at the people behind its Hollywood remake, Let Me In. But the truth is that Hollywood hasn’t let them down.
Those tricksy folks over at Google have got the interwebs into a right stir this morning by announcing the launch of Gmail Motion, letting you control your email with Kinect-style body movements. Watch the full description of the new tech in the great video above. The biggest problem? It’s the latest in a long line of Google April Fool’s jokes, which have included claims that the search engine is powered by a farm of pigeons, and last year’s launch of an app that could translate the babble of animals into human speech.
A new, urgent task of Samsung, the world’s unrivalled memory chip provider, seems to be developing chips for artificial intelligence applications on devices, including the company’s AI program Bixby on smartphones and connected home appliances, an emerging cash cow sought by many chip ventures around the world. Though belatedly compared to its major rivals such as Qualcomm, the South Korean tech behemoth has embarked on research and development of so-called “AI chips” with a goal of commercialization in the next few years, according to industry sources.
Fletcher Cox on the Eagles sideline after getting injured against the New Orleans Saints during the teams' January playoff game. Fletcher Cox said Tuesday that his goal is to be ready for training camp after undergoing “a procedure” for the foot injury he suffered in the Eagles’ Jan. 13 playoff loss at New Orleans. Cox left New Orleans wearing a walking boot and was wearing the boot in early March, when an ESPN.com report referenced the surgery. He was out of the boot and walking normally Tuesday, the second day of the Eagles’ offseason conditioning program.
Quite frankly, thoughts and prayers can only go so far. They have limited ability to protect our families. The time has come for our elected leaders – including President Barack Obama – to stand up and fight for our families and children, and their safety. But the American people support stronger gun safety measures more than he believes or cares to say. Polls now demonstrate this to be true. When our children are being shot at and killed in their schools, or movie theaters, we have to take meaningful action. These tragedies are too frequent, and are, as the president said, heartbreaking.
LONDON: Banks across Saudi Arabia are preparing for the transition from one riyal notes to one and two riyal coins by sorting, counting and depositing them within the banks. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) directed the banks in a letter that that they should stop dealing with the one riyal paper currency gradually until all the notes have completely disappeared across all branches. SAMA had earlier unveiled a new design of coins in different denominations, including the one riyal and the new two riyal coins. The other coins are in the 50-halala, 25-halala, 10-halala and one-halala denominations.
All of that and they fell a few yards short of breaking the modern-day record of 70 points in a game. For the record, the all-time record was 107 points against Patterson way back in 1918. Wonder what that game looked like? To be honest, I was wondering what I was watching at times during Saturday’s 66-38 win over New Mexico State at Cajun Field. It was lunacy there for a stretch in the first half. It was 7-on-7 football — almost literally. The new all-time record is 759 total yards, breaking the 728 against ULM a decade ago.
The former teen star has become more known for her bizarre behavior. Is Amanda Bynes the new Britney Spears? Maybe. The 26-year-old former Nickelodeon star tweeted on Thursday that aside from her platinum blonde (sometimes red) extensions she doesn’t have much hair. She blamed the John Barrett salon for her lack of locks. “I had to shave my head because of hair damage from someone @ John Barrett so I&apos;m not loving my paparazzi pics for a few years! I have extensions but you can see them!” she wrote.
There are currently as many as 3,000 girls in Finland who face the risk of being subjected to female genital mutilation or FGM, according to an analysis released by the National Institute for Health and Welfare on Friday. The THL data indicate that more than 10,000 girls and women resident in Finland have undergone the procedure. FGM is mostly carried out on young girls between infancy and the age of 15, according to the World Health Organisation. "In addition there are another estimated 650 to 3,000 girls living in Finland who are at risk of circumcision," said THL specialist Mimmi Koukkula of the agency's children and families unit.
HomeEntertainmentYvonne Chaka Chaka is back with new music! Yvonne Chaka Chaka is back with new music! Six. That is the number of times my lunch with Yvonne Chaka Chaka is interrupted. We’re sitting in a quaint corner at a restaurant on the Diamond Walk side of Sandton and behind this national treasure, who has just released her new album, Keep Looking At Me, is a towering Christmas tree next to a blazing fireplace. We don’t need it, though – Chaka Chaka is warm enough. That’s the manner with which she handles each interruption.
Jensen Ackles explains why Supernatural season 14 has a reduced episode count. Supernatural is one of the longest-running dramas on television, and it's the only show on The CW that carried over from when the network was originally just The WB. And considering that the series doesn't show any signs of slowing down, who knows how long it will go on for. Although Supernatural has been around for a long time, its viewership has remained somewhat steady over the years, which is why The CW recently gave the series a season 14 renewal.
A member of Argentine National Gendarmerie aims his gun to demonstrators during a protest against government-proposed pension reforms as protesters march to Argentine National Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on December 14, 2017. (Washington, D.C.) – A new government resolution in Argentina to regulate the use of firearms by security agents runs counter to basic human rights standards and could encourage shootings in unjustifiable circumstances, Human Rights Watch said today. On December 3, 2018, the Argentine Security Ministry approved a resolution regarding the use of firearms by members of federal security forces.

The National Broadcasting and Tele-communications Commission has given approval to cellular operators to test fourth-generation cellular broadband service on the 2.3-gigahertz and 1,800-megahertz frequencies. NBTC commissioner Colonel Settapong Malisuwan said the watchdog had approved a joint application by Advanced Info Service (AIS) and TOT to offer Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology 4G service on TOT’s 2.3GHz spectrum on a trial basis. The state agency will use 20MHz of its total 64MHz bandwidth of the spectrum in the trial. AIS and TOT will jointly set up 84 cell sites in Bangkok and some major provinces to conduct the testing.

If you've ever wanted to spend the night in a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the hotels on the Loire River provide you with that opportunity. Many of the more than 300 castles that have earned the central Loire Valley that designation now serve as hotels, allowing you to see for yourself that it is indeed "good to be king." Known as the "Garden of France," the Loire Valley also features more urban accommodation in such cities as Tours and Orleans. The city of Blois is home to the Château de Blois, which hosted Joan of Arc in 1429.
We inserted an iv in Mary’s arm and hooked her up to an external pacing device. But pacing her heart through her chest wall gave her severe discomfort and was not a good option, even in the short term. Moreover, it turned out that Mary’s slow beat did not respond at all to medications, including intravenous epinephrine. So she was quickly transported to the electrophysiology laboratory, dangling by her ankles, carried by the only man around with enough strength to do it. And my ER shift continued. The next day I was back on duty.
Texas' Looming Hispanic Shift Explained In 2 Charts : It's All Politics Within a decade, Hispanics are projected to eclipse non-Hispanic whites as the largest race or ethnic group in Texas. The political impact could reverberate across the nation. A bilingual sign outside a polling center ahead of local elections in Austin, Texas, on April 28.

Within a decade, Hispanics are projected to eclipse non-Hispanic whites as the largest race or ethnic group in Texas.
‘Treat others as you would want them to treat you!’ How many times do we hear this being said? We say it to our children and hope that they will remember it for the rest of their lives. We all know that to earn respect, we must first give respect and, of course, give it to ourselves as well, for if you don’t respect yourself, then no one else will respect you. Respect is one of the foundation stones of a healthy relationship but sadly it is very often not recognised as being essential.
Are you managing the "virtual you," or letting it run wild? Cyberspace is a messy soup of the personal and professional, visible to all with just a few mouse clicks. Snapshots of drunken antics posted on Facebook or indiscreet tidbits from a blog are easily uncovered by employers and recruiters. Alternatively, a stylish web portfolio featuring a blend of your work and life achievements can bolster your job hunt. A positive online persona is so crucial to career success these days that even invisibility can be a drawback. If people Google you and find zilch, you may not look like a player.
San Francisco-based United Commercial Bank has become the first recipient of TARP bailout money to be shut down by the FDIC. Last year, regulators approved a $299 million taxpayer-funded injection into the bank. That money, which was supposed to go to only "healthy banks," is now gone. The FDIC estimates United Commercial's failure will cost the agency's deposit fund about $1.4 billion. Our resident TARPologist, Paul Kiel, reported a few weeks ago that United Commercial Bank and three other supposedly "healthy banks" were in deep trouble.
The Central Bank of Nigeria and Polaris Bank on Thursday took a financial literacy programme to secondary schools in the Federal Capital Territory and Jos, calling on the pupils to imbibe the savings culture.

Mark Warburton believes he retains the backing of 95 per cent of Rangers supporters and insists he remains fully committed to the task of restoring the Ibrox club to the summit of Scottish football. The Rangers manager, who labelled speculation linking him with the vacancy at English Championship club Wigan Athletic as “nonsensical”, feels criticism of his team’s start to the season is largely confined to what he describes as “rogue comments” on radio phone-ins and newspaper hotlines. Warburton’s side have dropped 14 points from their first 10 Premiership fixtures, leaving them in fifth place in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Jerusalem-bound Route 1 reopened late Saturday; light snow and low temperatures felt throughout weekend, storm to pass by late Saturday; Defense ministry deploys equipment, food rations to assist emergency services. The Defense Ministry deployed a large quantity of heavy vehicles, equipment, and food rations to assist emergency services operating in the snow in Jerusalem and the North. Over 30 vehicles, bulldozers, plows, tractors, generators, and salt scattering trucks have been sent to roads around the capital and Safed.

A Limington woman drove a pickup truck through stopped traffic and led police on a 3-mile chase, the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office says. A Limington woman was arrested Friday night following a police chase during which she drove her pickup truck, which was missing a tire, through backed-up a traffic in Standish, hitting a half-dozen vehicles and continuing on for about 3 miles, authorities said.

A protected colony of birds has been forced to move on from their WA sanctuary after a feral cat killed 40 chicks last year. The Mandurah estuary colony was ravaged in December by an unidentified cat, which is believed to have single-handedly killed 40 fairy tern chicks and at least five adults. The Mandurah fairy tern breeding program has been a long-running project by the City of Mandurah, and chief executive Mark Newman said the colony had since abandoned the estuary as a result of the attacks. “After numerous attempts to prevent the cat from entering the sanctuary, it was trapped and euthanised,” he said.
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Scientists haven't rendered a verdict on whether coffee is good or bad for you but a California judge has. He says coffee sellers in the state should have to post cancer warnings. The culprit is a chemical produced in the bean roasting process that is a known carcinogen and has been at the heart of an eight-year legal struggle between a tiny nonprofit group and Big Coffee. The Council for Education and Research on Toxics wanted the coffee industry to remove acrylamide from its processing - like potato chip makers did when it sued them years ago - or disclose the danger in ominous warning signs or labels.
July 14, is Bastille Day. It is the day when the common people of France, despairing their grievances would never be addressed, stormed the Bastille It was a turning point for the French Revolution, and is celebrated annually with parades, fireworks and general festivity. This year the salute at the military parade down the Champs Elysees was taken jointly by the new President of France Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump. France is the U.S.’s oldest ally — the French navy and French troops helped American colonists defeat the British and achieve independence over 240 years ago.
WASHINGTON (NYTIMES) - President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is facing a mounting tangle of potential legal troubles arising from his business dealings with foreign entities and his interactions with both executive branch and congressional investigators. One set of problems stems from Russia. In 2015, Russian-linked companies paid Flynn more than US$65,000, including about US$45,000 from the state-backed Russian television network RT for a December trip to Moscow, where he delivered a speech and sat next to President Vladimir Putin at a dinner.
The Waupun and Winnebago Lutheran boys basketball programs lead the East Central and Flyway conferences, respectively. FOND DU LAC - With WIAA girls basketball regionals beginning Feb. 19 and boys regionals Feb. 25, local basketball programs will attempt to end the regular season with high success — and in some cases, a conference title. Winnebago Lutheran suffered just its fourth loss of the season Monday against Watertown Luther Prep. The team lost 73-61 but remains at the top of the Flyway Conference with an undefeated record. Junior point guards Carson Nell and Donovan Schwartz lead the team in scoring, averaging 15.6 and 15 points respectively.
The first leg of the long-sought North Spokane freeway opened in August 2009 and provides partial achievement of a high-speed, non-stop link from Interstate 90 to the edge of the Spokane urban area, a distance of 10.5 miles. The northern half of the project from Francis Avenue to Wandermere Road on U.S. Highway 395 is scheduled to open in 2011. It will complement the two-lane section opened in 2009, and will have interchange access for the two major North Side highways – U.S. 2 and 395. Nearly $570 million has been committed to planning, right-of-way and construction so far.
Democratic state chairmen, decrying postelection bickering, say the party’s gains were in large part a result of National Chairman Howard Dean’s 50-state strategy, which helped make deep inroads into Republican territory. The state chairmen, describing themselves as angered by infighting among party leaders in the House of Representatives as well as criticism of Mr. Dean by two prominent Democratic campaign consultants, credited the Dean strategy for their victories. The efforts of Mr. Dean, the former presidential candidate and Vermont governor, put them in a stronger position for the 2008 race for the White House, the chairmen said.
Movie studios continue to face the challenge of wooing audiences away from comfy couches and addictive electronic devices. To the rescue at year’s end came a batch of Oscar-ready contenders, many of them screening this month. In fact, some of the best “2016” films — Jim Jarmusch’s lyrical ode to the power of poetry and bus driving “Paterson” (Jan. 6), and the father-daughter epic “Toni Erdmann” (Jan. 20) — have only opened in New York or Los Angeles, in order to qualify for Oscar consideration, so you won’t see them in this list.
AUSTIN — Gov. Greg Abbott, breaking a self-imposed silence while Democrats Lupe Valdez and Andrew White tussle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, has begun treating Valdez as his fall opponent. Valdez, former sheriff of Dallas County, apparently ticked off the Republican governor late Wednesday afternoon when she issued a statement deriding Abbott and President Donald Trump's border security policy as a "boys and their toys" gambit doomed to fail. On Thursday, an Abbott spokesman declined to comment on the governor's late-night tweet. His cavalier dismissal of the chances of White, a Houston investor and son of the late Gov.
Ronald Gene Watters, 47, was re-sentenced March 8, 2018 in connection with the 1988 homicide of a student at what was then Salisbury State University. A Salisbury man convicted of first-degree murder in the 1988 assault and suffocation of a college student has been re-sentenced to life in prison. The Wicomico County State's Attorney's Office said Lisa Taylor, a 19-year-old student at what was then Salisbury State University, disappeared June 7, 1988. Her body was discovered three months later in a wooded lot near the university where Ronald Gene Watters, now 47, and two accomplices had left her after assaulting and suffocating her.
HOLLYWOOD -- Two fledgling networks, both backed by powerful media forces, launched in January 1995, both vying for the dubious distinction of becoming the fifth-largest broadcast network behind ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox. It was a fight to the death -- literally. After more than a decade of triumphs and misfires, massive financial losses and continuing struggles, both succumbed, replaced last year by the merger of the two, The CW. But despite their downfall, The WB and UPN left a lasting effect on popular culture and the TV landscape with landmark series such as "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Gilmore Girls."

The United States Navy retired the venerable Grumman F-14 Tomcat in 2006 after more than three decades in service. However, the Tomcat’s demise has left gaps in the carrier air wing that are only now being felt. With the end of the Cold War and declining budgets, the Navy simply could not afford to keep the incredibly maintenance intensive and unreliable Tomcat on the carrier flight deck. Moreover, with the demise of the Soviet threat, the Tomcat’s primary mission of fleet defense has fallen by the wayside and the venerable jet was increasingly used in the strike role.

Most of the time deleted scenes are deleted for a reason. Sometimes they provide information that is already given in another scene. Other times they disrupt the flow of a movie. Then there are scenes that remain almost the same, but are just trimmed on the edges like fat on a steak. New deleted scenes from Super 8 and Sucker Punch have found their way online and both fall into a few of those categories. The Super 8 clip is largely a scene that’s in the final cut of the film, it’s just happens to feature some of the fat that was nipped and tucked away.
Up to 300 Hindu pilgrims are feared dead and hundreds injured during a stampede at a Hindu festival in India. The stampede happened during a pilgrimage to the remote Mandhar Devi temple in western Maharashtra state. Officials say thousands panicked during a religious procession after a fire broke out in roadside stalls. Many pilgrims were crushed and burned to death as the fire forced crowds into a narrow stairway leading to the hilltop temple. The stampede occurred near the village of Wai, more than 200km (125 miles) south of Mumbai (Bombay), where pilgrims congregate every year at the temple to venerate a Hindu goddess.

Seems like every blog about notebook computers and batteries is bad news -- recalls, fires and the like. Well, how about some good news for a change! Hewlett-Packard (HP) will reportedly release a notebook next month that can run for to 24 hours using a high-capacity battery -- but only if it's running Microsoft's Windows XP operating system. The long-lasting notebook will be a special configuration of the 6930p, part of HP's EliteBook line. The allure of a battery that can last a day is incontestable, as anyone who has spent time in an airport searching for a power outlet knows.

The Palike is constructing the foot overbridge (FOB), which will be equipped with lifts and escalators, in a public-private partnership (PPP). “There is public demand for a skywalk here and we have done a feasibility report that clearly says there is a need for an FOB for passengers going to the railway station,” a BBMP officer said.
Lani Malmberg stands among her herd in 2014. A herd of 500 goats arrived in Bear Creek Regional Park on Oct. 26, and they'll stay there through the following weekend munching on weeds and poisonous plants. The herd will munch through 20 acres of the park surrounding the Charmaine Nymann Community Garden, according to a statement from El Paso County. The nonprofit Bear Creek Garden Association raises about $10,000 each year to pay for the organic weed control. The goats eliminate the need for harmful herbicides, and digest weeds and poisonous plants without spreading their seeds.

My name is Barbara. I have been a patient of Dr. Gong’s for probably about ten years. She practices in the northwest valley part of Phoenix around the area of 35th Avenue north of Greenway Road. Fortunately I don’t have a lot of allergies, but this year I’ve had a lot of allergies and I wear contacts so I was concerned. I never want to use the eye drops because I was told you shouldn’t use eye drops with contacts, but since I have come here she gave me a prescription for eye drops and I have used them and they are wonderful.

B'way talks: good news, bad news? The stagehands union and the League of American Theatres and Producers will resume negotiations Nov. 7, nearly a month after contract talks broke off. But the renewed discussions might move Broadway closer to a strike than a resolution, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. The members of the union, Local One of IATSE, voted Oct. 21 to give the leadership authority to call a strike. The next day, the league unilaterally implemented portions of its final offer, which the union had received Oct. 9, the last day the two sides talked.
BANGKOK – Authorities in the Indonesian island of Bali raised on Sunday the flight warning level to the highest – from orange to red – as the Mt. Agung volcano continued to spew up to 4,000 meters high columns of ash, official sources said. Around twenty flights to and from Bali, the main tourist destination in Indonesia that records around 200,000 foreign tourists annually, were canceled Saturday night, stranding more than 2000 people. “The volcano and movement of ash cloud are highly unpredictable which means we may need to cancel flights at short notice,” Australian low-cost airline Jetstar said on its website.

Texas would like to play Texas A&M at some point down the road. Tom Herman will tell you that. So will Chris Del Conte. Problem is, “down the road” keeps getting pushed, well, down the road. The Longhorns are all booked up through 2027 and, according to Chip Brown of Horns247, more elite non-conference series are on the way. Texas officials have had discussions with Clemson, an opponent the Longhorns have never faced, about a possible home-and-home in 2030 and 2031, the source said.

, is likely due for a title change, the rapper said in a recent interview with MTV. Nas said he wants to change the title because it was giving people the wrong impression. "A lot of people around me didn't understand where I was coming from. They kinda thought I was saying, 'Let's pop bottles, we're rich, everything's good.' That's not where I was coming from," he said. "So there's another title that came that kind of fits a little better, and you might hear about that.
The rally by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 1658 comes as oral arguments are scheduled in the union's lawsuit against Trump. Detroit members of a federal employees union will rally on Wednesday in opposition to three executive orders by President Trump affecting union rights, according to a news release.

Chris Paul denied the Los Angeles Clippers' three-year extension offer Saturday night, according to Broderick Turner of the Los Angeles Times. Naturally, this leads to heavy speculation concerning the All-Star point guard's future. Frank Isola, New York Daily News' Knicks beat writer, shed some light on the situation at hand. This isn't a new idea. Before Paul was sent from the New Orleans Hornets to the Clippers, the Knicks were believed to be his destination of choice. When Paul denied the Clippers' three-year, $60 million extension offer on Saturday, the Knicks became an obvious, if unrealistic, candidate.
With only a couple of days left in the Spring Gobbler season, Ed set his sights on Penn’s Woods. Since the season had arrived, he had been a-field only on Saturdays. Last Saturday was the only time he had a bird almost in range of his 870. Then it decided to move in another direction and quit responding to his calls. This bird was on his mind as he drove in the early morning hours. He was going to set up close to the same resting spot that he had been in when he saw the gobbler.

The 26 area residents made their feelings known in a petition handed to Colorado Springs Utilities' executive director, Phillip Tollefson, on Friday, Jan 21. The city-owned energy enterprise is involved in the shelter proposal, because the $6 million homeless-services center will be built on part of the agency's Drake Power Plant complex on South Sierra Madre Street.
Dave Doggett admitted that he is frustrated that Cambridge United are just outside the playoff spots. The U&apos;s chairman was writing in his programme notes ahead of the Newport County fixture this weekend, where they will look to make it back to back home wins. And while he said Shaun Derry and the team appreciate the support, he added that the negativity around some of the games has puzzled him. "Obviously, it is frustrating because if only we had picked up a few more points we would be in a play-off place in the league," he said.

The US’ decision to ease restrictions on military aid for foreign forces and other fighters supporting the US in Syria is unlikely to affect the situation in eastern Aleppo, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at an OSCE Ministerial Council in Hamburg. “I don’t think this will significantly change the situation in eastern Aleppo, because the rebels are encircled and they are unlikely to receive reinforcing,” Lavrov said. Russia is looking for a solution that involves as few casualties as possible, Lavrov said. “I think everyone understands that the militants in east Aleppo are agonizing.

Transparency and collaboration. These have been Bill Bratton's buzzwords as he shapes his leadership of the NYPD. Yet changing the department's culture after 12 years of Ray Kelly is proving a challenge. Kelly was not only the most powerful -- and largely successful -- police commissioner in city history, he also allowed no transparency and rarely collaborated. In his first turn in 1994 under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Bratton followed a weak mayor and a weaker police commissioner. Bratton came running out of the chute with pronouncements that portended radical change after the do-nothing culture fostered during the David Dinkins administration.

Singer-songwriter Michael Benjamin Lerner is a hipster, and he's not ashamed to admit it. "I like music. I like photography. I like coffee. I like living in Seattle, and all of these things are hipster things so I probably am a hipster. I like skinny jeans. . . . I have dark-rimmed glasses," Lerner says by phone somewhere between Portland, Ore., and Chicago on his way to rehearse with a new bass player. Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie discovered Lerner's tunes in 2008, and his career took off from there.
What Are Tax-Deferred Annuity Taxation Rules? Annuities have unusual tax characteristics, but they come with some pitfalls as well. Many investors use annuities as part of their overall financial planning, and these insurance-company products come with some interesting tax benefits. However, along with those benefits, you also have to keep in mind some rules you have to follow that can lead to some unexpected surprises if you're not aware of them. Let's look more closely at how annuities get taxed. Annuity contracts offer no up-front tax break when you first buy the annuity.
AMERICA’S INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS HELP: American infrastructure has fallen behind due to years of inaction and a broken permitting system. The United States ranks tenth in the world in terms of quality of overall infrastructure, according to the World Economic Forum. One out of every five miles of U.S. highway pavement is in poor condition. Americans spent an estimated 6.9 billion hours delayed in traffic in 2014, or 42 hours per driver. One third of America’s bridges are 50 years or older. There are an estimated 240,000 water main breaks every year in the U.S.
Red tape has held back American infrastructure investment.
On Thursday, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio pushed �the reset button� in its controversial rate case involving American Electric Power. Todd Snitchler, the commission chairman, explained that starting over would �ensure that we have a complete picture of any proposal, and balance the interests of all customers and the utility.� He stressed that Ohio would continue moving toward a competitive marketplace for electricity. Again, his words and those of other commissioners sounded reassuring. Then, there is the reality of what the commission does. In December, the panel approved a rate plan for AEP that soon proved a colossal embarrassment.
The family of a slain Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy announced Sunday--the first anniversary of the killing--that they have raised the reward for information leading to a conviction in the case to $100,000.

Ballpoint pen ink has a way of getting onto some of the least likely surfaces, such as a wall. The faster you treat the ink spot, the easier it is to remove; it may take a couple different methods to remove the ink completely. Apply a white, non-gel toothpaste over the ink spot on any type of wall surface, using just enough toothpaste to cover the ink. After 10 minutes, wipe the toothpaste up with a slightly damp cloth, dabbing in the direction of the ink mark. Do not rub; rubbing may spread the stain and make the problem worse.

Safeway and Giant have arranged to hire more than 3,200 temporary employees to fill in for any union workers who walk out on strike if management and labor fail to resolve their contract dispute by the deadline Tuesday, company officials said yesterday. Meanwhile, the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union is predicting food supply shortages and shorter hours at Giant and Safeway stores if workers vote to strike. Safeway plans to use management staff to assist the 1,700 temporary employees. The company is running newspaper ads this weekend to hire more employees in case the two sides fail to reach an agreement.

The Trump administration has thrown into doubt a multimillion-dollar research contract to test new treatments for HIV that relies on fetal tissue - work targeted by anti-abortion lawmakers and social conservatives aligned with the president. The turmoil over the National Institutes of Health contract with the University of California San Francisco is part of a building battle between conservatives opposed to research using fetal tissue and scientists who say the material is vital to developing new therapies for diseases from AIDS to Parkinson's. In recent weeks, Health and Human Services officials have held sessions with patient advocates, scientific societies, ethicists and leading abortion opponents - to hear their views.

The mother brand, Mercedes-Benz, is the brand that sets the stage for the others to follow. Gorden Wagener is clearly under some stress. The 49-year-old chief design officer for Daimler AG enters the presentation room on crutches, looking more than a bit worse for wear. The week prior to this gathering at Mercedes-Benz global design headquarters in Sindelfingen, he fell off a horse. That same week, one of his employer’s bigger sponsorship properties, the top-ranked German national football team, suffered an ignominious and early ouster from the World Cup. Wagener knows stress.
There was something bleakly comical about Diane Abbott’s response to the question. Asked repeatedly by the BBC’s Nick Robinson on Friday’s edition of Radio 4’s Today programme whether there were any circumstances in which the Labour Party would consider supporting military action, the shadow home secretary answered “the Second World War”. Be reassured, then, that if some glitch in time should occur, Abbott, Jeremy Corbyn and their front-bench colleagues will stand four square behind the effort to end Adolf Hitler’s murderous campaign.

Kurt Sanders issues a warning to the onslaught of journalists making the leap into content marketing: never stop being a journalist. Our group account director recently tagged me in on this excellent article via Mumbrella about why journos make the best content marketers. And it’s true – they understand audiences on a cellular level, their careers are built on purpose and the best journos are absolute beasts when it comes to agility (the good type). I once saw a senior subeditor nail six yarns with killer headlines on deadline all while screaming on the phone to her solicitor who was managing a home purchase crisis on settlement day.

A terrible fog of censorship is seeping into our college campuses. It’s like a fart in an elevator—everyone smells it but no one will own it. You know our country is in serious trouble when the voice of reason is a comedian known for making prank calls with puppets. But, alas, here we are. Congratulations, America—you’ve made me, Adam Carolla, the sane one in the room. I realize my brief stint in a San Fernando Valley community college doesn’t necessarily qualify me as the most distinguished, academic spokesperson on the subject.
“What in the Disney Hell is this? !” Sara asks in an extended trailer for Legends of Tomorrow Season 4, which delivers plenty of magical mayhem, including a “psychopath” fairy godmother and a “homicidal maniac” unicorn. Elsewhere in the preview, the Waverider team — Time Bureau boss Ava included — goes undercover as camp counselors to track down a swamp monster, then battles a Godzilla-like creature and is attacked by “living” dolls. Plus, Ray Palmer gets turned into… a pig! You know, just the typical, delightful wackiness for the Arrowverse spinoff.
The Guardian has launched a new series of e-books. Guess which topic they’ve taken on first? Melville House goes hybrid: scan a book’s special barcode for additional features. As Amazon Publishing gears up, how many competing bookstores will stock its titles? We’re losing the expertise of seasoned book reviewers and squeezing out a generation of new ones, writes the Los Angeles Review of Books. Which book characters are #UndateableinLit? Check out this funny quiz based on the popular hashtag. Matthew Hollis describes how the First World War interrupted the friendship of the poets Edward Thomas and Robert Frost.
“Cape Up” is Jonathan’s weekly podcast talking to key figures behind the news and our culture. Subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher and anywhere else you listen to podcasts. The day before President Trump’s rambling Rose Garden remarks announcing a national emergency on our southern border, I sat down with Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.). All that was needed was for Congress to vote on the budget deal to avert another government shutdown and send the legislation to Trump’s desk for his signature. And Bass was clear-eyed about what Trump’s theater was masking.
Honolulu just passed the Distracted Walking Law, which states that "no pedestrian shall cross a street or highway while viewing a mobile electronic device.” Interestingly, the earlier drafts of the bylaw included restrictions on their use in cars, but that got dropped from the bill, which now just regulates pedestrians. And don’t think about taking a photo either; that’s apparently illegal too. We hold the unfortunate distinction of being a major city with more pedestrians being hit in crosswalks, particularly our seniors, than almost any other city in the county.

VETERAN comedian Jasper Carrott proves stand-up really does rock in his new show tomorrow night. The Brummie funnyman rocketed to fame in the Seventies when his folk music career morphed into comedy. After novelty record Funky Moped, produced by ELO's Jeff Lynne, made the Top 10 in 1975, he went on to develop a string of anecdotal sketches for his live act. He went on be a TV regular, starring in Carrott's Lib, Carrott's Commercial Breakdown, Carrott Confidential and Canned Carrott. Now he is back with a brand new show before introducing his music pals to rock the audience.
Are there resources to help me decide which charities to contribute to? Is it safe to donate online? The most well-known online evaluation source is Charity Navigator which has a database of ratings of over 2,500 charities in the United States.They have a Holiday Giving Guide under “Hot topics”, as well as information of protecting yourself from online scams and guides to donating your car in the Tips and Resources section. You can browse by categories. The American Institution of Philanthropy charges for its report of about a 500 charities, but it does freely provide a list by category of 150 of the top-rated charities from this guide.
There is no disagreement that changes to the tax code should promote economic growth, fuel job creation and increase incomes. The question is whether the Republican tax bills would accomplish those goals. Several prominent conservative economists have argued that the proposals would do just that. Many others across the ideological spectrum have challenged those conclusions, saying the plan would cause the nation’s debt to rise substantially faster than the economy. Deficit-financed tax cuts are widely believed to undermine growth. There is also substantial disagreement about who would ultimately gain. Republican leaders argue that the substantial tax cuts for business would eventually result in wage increases.
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski challenged freshman Luke Kennard earlier this week. The 6-foot-5 freshman guard from Franklin poured in a career-high 24 points, including 10 in overtime, in No. 7 Duke’s 77-75 overtime loss to Utah on Saturday at Madison Square Garden. Kennard hit 12-of-13 free throws and also grabbed eight rebounds as the Blue Devils fell to 9-2. With Duke trailing by six, Kennard notched a four-point play with under 10 seconds to go. Utah turned the ball over on the ensuing possession but Brandon Ingram missed the potential game-tying shot in the waning moments.
The doctor from Apollo Hospital said J Jayalalithaa did not need heart surgery. A cardio thoracic surgeon of Apollo Hospital on Monday told a panel probing the death of former Chief Minister late J Jayalalithaa that she did not have any heart diseases. The Justice A Arumughaswamy Commission of Inquiry examined Dr L F Sridhar, a cardio thoracic surgeon and was among doctors who attended to Jayalalithaa during her hospitalisation. The panel has examined several doctors on Jayalalithaa's health issues and complications, the diagnostic tests done and treatment options pursued as part of its fact finding exercise.
Dublin Central TD Maureen O'Sullivan is one of those involved with the Independents' Network. INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES RUNNING in the local elections were told that Ireland is the “best little country in the world” in which to run as an independent at a workshop event in Dublin today. Independents’ Network, a nascent alliance of independent, left-leaning TDs, gathered at the Teachers’ Club in Dublin to give advice and support to dozens of local authority candidates running in the 23 May elections with just over 40 people attending today’s event.
WWE Star Returning To Team With Roman Reigns And Dean Ambrose Against The Wyatt Family? - Wrestling Inc.
- WWE is teasing a new partner for Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose as they now have to deal with three Wyatt Family members - Braun Strowman, Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper. We noted before that Reigns and Ambrose vs. Harper and Wyatt is likely for Night of Champions, so it looks like we could see the debut of their third man there or they could do it on an upcoming RAW and turn the pay-per-view match into a six-man.
I rarely read your online edition, but did see the interview with Paul Crespo. It reassures me that my decision to stop my subscription to the print edition of your magazine was right. Instead of defending Americans right to their own memory, customs and identity, you eagerly shilled for the browning of America. Having chosen treason, you should not whine when the day of reckoning for traitors arrives. That’s exactly the sort of soft shoe so many of us learned to spot during last year’s immigration battles. No, Mr. Crespo, I do NOT agree that all immigrants should become American citizens.

The Eagles went 26-5 last year and will try to pick up where they left off when the season starts on Friday. EVANSVILLE, Ind. — A couple new banners are hanging from the rafters inside the Physical Activities Center for its final year. That’s because the University of Southern Indiana women’s basketball team is coming off one of its best seasons in program history. The Eagles finished 26-5, won the Great Lakes Valley Conference East Division and made an NCAA Division II tournament appearance. Rick Stein, entering his 20th season as head coach, has about a dozen banners hanging he can admire and reminisce upon.
All across the northern third of Africa the rains continue to fall. Normally dry lands are awash from Mauritania to Ehtiopia. All across the northern third of Africa the rains continue to fall. Normally dry lands are awash from Mauritania to Ehtiopia. We're used to hearing of drought in the Sudan, but floods? Think of a Katrina that just keeps coming. And it's all related to unusual weather patterns which aparently surprised the local governments. Sound familiar? Nobody's able to say this is part of any larger pattern, of course.
Two Suffolk based soldiers have been charged with perverting the course of justice after allegedly making false statements to police in relation to a road collision. Andrew Hollis and Geraint Bayliss, both 19, of 653 Squadron 3 Regiment Army Air Corps (AAC), Wattisham Airfield, appeared at magistrates court in Ipswich on Tuesday. Both men are accused of committing an act, or series of acts, with intent to pervert the course of public justice – namely making a false statement to police in relation to a collision in Needham Market on December 12.
In this year’s Math League Summer Tournament for middle-school students from Asia and North America, held at the College of New Jersey, participants studied the math of dice. Deena has a white die, a red die, a green die, and a blue die. All are ordinary, fair six-sided dice. If she rolls all four of them, there are 56 different outcomes in which the sum of the pips showing on top is nine. Only one other number occurs as the sum of the top faces in exactly 56 outcomes. What is it?
Last Sunday, I commented in this space about the seemingly sudden decision by Columbia city manager Mike Matthes to resign his post, when in the same issue our Rudi Keller was reporting the manager’s exit had been in the works for weeks while he and the city council negotiated terms of Matthes' severance. So it is when a columnist with days-ahead deadlines tries to reflect breaking news. The elements of Matthes’ departure mentioned in the column persist and will remain important after he is gone. Not least is the matter of community policing.
Victims of the "horrific" practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) can now get help at a walk-in clinic at Whipps Cross Hospital, which is the first of its kind in the country. The clinic, run by Barts Health NHS Trust, offers cervical screening tests to women and gives them the opportunity to see an FGM specialist gynaecologist as well as other specialists including a psycho-social practitioner, an FGM specialist midwife and an interpreter. Dr Reeba Oliver, who runs the clinic, said: "FGM has serious health consequences that go into adulthood.
Our highlighted race this week will be the $250,000, Sam F. Davis Stakes at Tampa Bay Downs, a mile and a sixteenth contest for three year olds who are on the Road to the Kentucky Derby.

HUGO LLORIS reckons Paul Pogba has shown England just how good he is once and for all. Pogba has struggled to convince people he is worth a world-record £90m since joining Manchester United from Juventus last summer. But Pogba had the last laugh on his critics with an all-action performance on Tuesday night. The midfielder was a revelation from start to finish and Tottenham keeper Lloris is convinced the doubters have been made to look foolish. The France skipper said: “Maybe he had some things to prove, because he belongs to one of the best clubs in the world.

Google is teaming up with Boys & Girls Clubs of America to bring a computer science program to more middle school students around the country. SAN FRANCISCO — Google is teaming up with Boys & Girls Clubs of America to bring a program that teaches computer science to more elementary and middle-school students across the country. Called CS First, the program teaches kids ages 9 to 14 how to express themselves and their interests through computer code. Google launched CS First in July 2013 as a pilot program out of its South Carolina data center. The program geared to fourth- to eighth-graders is called a "club in a box."
Disney and Alibaba are launching a Mickey Mouse-shaped device that will allow Chinese consumers to stream the company's movies, TV shows and other media, the two firms said on Tuesday. The device, which can be connected to TVs, is available for pre-sale on Alibaba's shopping site Tmall.com for $125 which will include a year's subscription to the service called DisneyLife. Users in the world's second-largest economy will be able to stream movies, play games, read e-books and listen to songs from Disney. All that is needed is an internet connection.
While some artists and designers might cling to the pieces still remaining in their personal collections, here's one designer that certainly doesn't: Helmut Lang. After donating much of his extensive body of work to museums and individuals all over the world, the designer has apparently shredded his remaining 6,000 pieces and made them into sculptures. According to WWD, Lang's reworked fashion archive, now in the form of about 12 massive column figures, will go on display for solo exhibition titled "Make it Hard" at the Fireplace Project gallery in East Hampton.
In a culture in which speaking about death and dying has long been taboo, and with a health care system that does not foster such conversations, it should come as no surprise that only about 30 percent of Americans have advance directives for health care on file. Even then, an advance directive is just a paper form, and often one that is not accessible at the point of care. More meaningful planning occurs when an individual has a health-care agent - a person with the legal authority to make health-care decisions on another's behalf.
In a speech at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, delivered January 19 2018, U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis announced the nation’s latest National Defense Strategy, The first in ten years, Secretary Mattis indicated that the thrust of the nation’s policy had shifted away from fighting terrorism toward countering the threat posed by Russia and China. Most maliciously, authorities invariably deflect criticism of U.S. policy by attempting to link dissenting publications with Russia. Given that the U.S. appears to be just as self-serving and law defying as Russia is accused of being, what is the reality behind the unrelenting anti-Russian propaganda campaign?
The head of the District of Columbia agency that builds and manages government property has stepped down citing personal reasons. The Washington Post reports Department of General Services Director Christopher Weaver, a retired Navy rear admiral, resigned effective Friday. Greer Johnson Gillis, previously a deputy director in the Department of Transportation, is the agency's interim leader. DGS has come under fire in recent months for its initial plan for homeless shelters to replace the former D.C. General Hospital. Some parents and pediatricians had also criticized the agency for what they said was inadequate led testing in schools and other facilities.
The Swiss parliament has rejected a controversial air transport accord with Germany, aimed at ending a long-running dispute over noise pollution. The House of Representatives discussed the agreement on Wednesday. But a broad alliance of opponents argued the deal, reached between the Swiss transport minister, Moritz Leuenberger, and his German counterpart, Kurt Bodewig, would jeopardise the future of Switzerland's main airport of Zurich. Under the accord, struck last October, both sides agreed to cut by a third the number of flights permitted to use airspace over southern Germany used as an approach to Zurich airport.

E-commerce giant Alibaba Group and affiliated online payment service Alipay are aiming to use facial recognition technology to take the place of passwords. On Sunday, Alibaba chairman Jack Ma showed off the new feature while speaking at the Cebit trade fair in Hanover, Germany. Using Alipay, Ma bought a souvenir stamp from Alibaba’s e-commerce site in China. But to confirm the purchase, Ma scanned his face using the front camera on his smartphone. Alibaba, which reigns as China’s largest e-commerce player, said Monday that the facial recognition feature was still under development.

LOS ANGELES — California is moving up its election primaries to join the Super Tuesday pile in a bid to make the nation's biggest haul of presidential delegates relevant again. With a handful of exceptions, California has traditionally held its primaries in June — at a time when the major-party presidential nominees have often already been chosen. That's what happened last year, when Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton had already sewn up the Republican and Democratic nominations before California and its 19.4 million registered voters could allocate the country's biggest chunk of delegates to either party's convention.

News about John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, including commentary and archival articles published in The New York Times. The newest group of 25 MacArthur Fellows has been announced. The honor comes with an award of $625,000. This year’s MacArthur fellows, who each win $625,000 awards, include writers, scientists, artists, a human rights lawyer and a journalist. Mr. Coates was hired at The Atlantic in 2008. He became famous for his sweeping essays about systemic racism in the United States. It takes much more than a MacArthur Fellowship to justify the label.
Trumbull's Patrick Lomnitzer controls the ball as Staples' Kosta Papa defends during Tuesday's lacrosse match at Trumbull High School. The barrage kept coming from all angles and directions, and Trumbull goalie Will Testani kept the Eagles in it. Staples never stopped, though, peppering the Trumbull net with more than enough shots to finally build a big lead and beat the Eagles 9-4 Tuesday at McDougall Stadium in FCIAC boys lacrosse. "I feel like a lot of our shots were decent shots," said Kip Orban, Staples' standout senior midfielder who scored four goals.
Obesity Isn’t a Personal Choice. It's a Cultural Decision. Obesity isn't about an individual's choices. It's about the choices of a whole culture. Overeating — and subsequent obesity — has become a national issue. Michelle Obama spent most of the last eight years publicly addressing the topics of fitness and nutrition, serving as a benchmark of nutrition (where are we as a culture if the First Lady had to tell us to eat our vegetables?). However, it's wrong to assume that the obesity epidemic is due to a lack of willpower or personal failure, as is often the narrative.
TEHRAN (AFP): Iran said Monday that EU sanctions over its human rights record were due to “differing values” but that they should not derail dialogue with Europe. “We have certain differences of opinion with European countries and the European Union,” foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said at a press conference. “That is due in part to differing values between our region and the Islamic Republic of Iran and the European Union, notably as concerns human rights,” he said. The EU on Thursday extended by a year sanctions against 82 individuals and an entity accused of “serious human rights violations in Iran”.
One: His name is Frostie, the baby snow goat. Two: Some beautiful people built him a little wheelchair. Three: There’s just… that happy goat sound he makes near the end. It’s… We’re unable to cope. The story goes like this: Edgar’s Mission, a nonprofit farm animal rescue sanctuary in Victoria, Australia, received Frostie the goat, and saw that he had a disease called joint navel ill. That’s a musculoskeletal affliction some goats suffer from that can make them lose the use of their legs.
The Norwegian government has repeatedly proposed implementing tuition fees for students outside of the EU. The International Students Union of Norway (ISU), in cooperation with several other student organizations, has fought against the proposal, and been successful, at least so far. This year, the government proposes ending a funding program for students from developing countries and countries in Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia called the “Quota Scheme.” This program offers 1,100 spots at any given time for students to take a degree in Norway who may have otherwise not had the opportunity to do so.
Takaud, a specialist provider of savings, investment and pension solutions for the Mena region, is organising a seminar on pension for expatriates at the Capital Club, Bahrain, on March 15. Takaud is partnering with Sovereign Pension Services, an approved provider of trusts for pension transfers under QROPS (Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme) for people who have lived and worked in the UK, in organising the seminar. Despite generous salaries and benefits, along with the excellent working conditions available in the Gulf region, expatriate workers in large numbers could be facing a future with an inadequate pension income, a Takaud expert said.
ZAMBOANGA CITY — In what could be the first suicide bombing in the country, a powerful blast killed at least 11 people and wounded nine others early on Tuesday in Lamitan City, Basilan province, raising fears of more such attacks. Vice Mayor Roderick Furigay said only 10 were killed when the bomb in the vehicle blew up a few meters from the Magwakit Patrol Base of the 19th Special Forces Company at Bulanting village. “We don’t count the life of a demon,” an angry Furigay told the Inquirer, referring to the bomber.

Google is looking to take on cable TV in a big way, not only prepping a huge bid for Hulu but also spending hundreds of millions of dollars acquiring content for YouTube. According to Business Insider, Google is spending perhaps over $500 million striking deals with cable programmers, independent studios and other content producers to bring content to its video site. How could all this original content on the web compete with cable? Well, remember that Google just spent a ton of money buying Motorola, a company that makes not only cellphones, but cable boxes.

The restaurant will hire 95 people in positions including hosts, servers, bartenders, food runners, and line and prep cooks.
It’s a beautiful thing when a production car sticks close to the concept. Infiniti did just that with the new Q60 Coupe, the replacement for the venerable coupe once known as the G37, and they gave it 400 horsepower from a twin-turbo V6 for good measure. The coupe sports the new 3.0-liter twin turbo VR V6 in two flavors, and both send power to either the rear wheels or all four via a 7-speed transmission. No manual in sight this time, sadly. Power’s rated at 400 HP and 350 pound-feet of torque for the high-output version and 300 HP and 295 pound-feet for the lesser version.
The free event will be back at the Fox Cities Exhibition Center in downtown Appleton on April 6. Last year's event got pummeled by a snow storm. When putting together the second-ever Fox Cities Kidz Expo, organizers couldn't have been more unlucky with their chosen weekend. The 2018 edition landed on the Saturday in April when northeast Wisconsin was bombarded with more than 20 inches of snow. Instead of the 5,000 to 6,000 people expected to come out to the Fox Cities Exhibition Center, about 1,500 battled the elements to enjoy the interactive offerings.
Congratulations, Marshawn Lynch! Your Beast Mode run versus the New Orleans Saints in the 2010 Wild Card Playoffs was voted the best touchdown shot! Steve Young’s touchdown had a great run through our tournament, including knocking off the #2 seed–The Music City Miracle–in the second round.

Phantoms' players celebrate after booking their place in the play-off finals. Photo: Alan Storer. Peterborough Phantoms’ best season in years just continues to get better. Dismissed by many as being an early-season flash in the pan and written-off by plenty of others as over-achievers, Phantoms are now two games from English Premier League play-offs trophy glory. Slava Koulikov’s magnificent men booked their place in the finals for the first time in four seasons after leading from the opening minute until the final buzzer of their quarter-final triumph over Swindon at the weekend.
NEWARK, N.J. -- Right wing Jonathan Drouin scored his first NHL game-winning goal in his return to the lineup on Thursday to help the Tampa Bay Lightning to a 4-2 victory against the New Jersey Devils at Prudential Center. Drouin, recalled from Syracuse of the American Hockey League on Wednesday played his first NHL game since Dec. 30, and scored his first goal since Dec. 2. He controlled a drop pass from Vladislav Namestnikov in the right circle and took a wrist shot that beat goaltender Keith Kinkaid between the pads for a 3-1 lead 3:50 into the third period.
High-flying Parthus Technologies is under attack over the Infostream wonderchip it launched less than two weeks ago. The group, whose shares have rocketed since floating in May, boasted Infostream was 'the world's most advanced Mobile Internet computing platform on a single chip' when it unveiled the product. It is hoped the chip will run the next generation of 'smart' mobiles which will follow WAP phones. However, technology group Psion said it was the chip's true developer, which it then licensed to Parthus, and said it will get about half of any revenues generated.

Yet again the transfer window seems to be passing by with barely a mention of Stoke City. This summer all the narcoleptic gamblers, crocks, and 'ard workers seem to be tied down to lengthy contracts elsewhere. Much to my son&apos;s continued disgust, Stoke City are the least interesting Premiership club to support during the transfer window. Almost the entire school summer holidays can be wasted parked in front of Sky Sports News watching absolutely nothing happening. Or as Sir Anthony Pulis would put it, &apos;waiting for something to drop&apos;.
The commandant of the US Marine Corps announced a 24-hour operational pause for all of the branch’s aircraft Friday, a move that comes after the Marines suffered two deadly crashes in recent weeks. “Gen. Robert B. Neller, Commandant of the US Marine Corps, directed US Marine Corps aviation units to conduct an operational reset for a 24 hour-period where no flight operations will take place but no operational commitments will be impacted,” the Marine Corps said in a statement. The pause will affect all Marine Corps aircraft, including those with tilt-rotors, helicopters and fixed-wing planes.
This year Riverhead High School’s girls volleyball team has been moved from League IV to League III, where it will play against bigger schools. In trading places with Centereach, Riverhead is the only newcomer to League III, a mystery team to the rest of the league, if you will. Riverhead coach Amy Greene likes that. The Blue Waves will face the likes of Smithtown East, Smithtown West, West Islip, Newfield and North Babylon, but will do so with a sense of confidence after making the playoffs for the first time in three years last season.
The Old Man Logan series may be coming to an end, but Marvel has one more story to tell starring the elder Wolverine. Dead Man Logan is a 12-issue limited series from writer Ed Brisson and artist Mike Henderson that will see Old Man Logan returning to his own timeline to finally get revenge on Mysterio, the villain who tricked him into murdering the X-Men. Marvel and Brisson have billed the series as the end of the Old Man Logan saga. "This is it. This is going to be the big, final Old Man Logan story," Brisson told Newsarama.
The Panthers have feasted on pocket passers all season, the latest example being Carson Palmer, who committed six turnovers in Carolina’s 49-15 win over Arizona in the NFC championship. Carolina’s defense, which led the league in takeaways, quickly shifts from good to great when the offense gives them a lead. They have nine takeaways and eight sacks in the postseason. Luke Kuechly, one of three All-Pro players on defense, has two interception returns for touchdowns in the playoffs. But the trigger for Carolina is establishing the running game.
After holding a five-point lead at the half, the Massachusetts men’s basketball team found itself trailing Providence 51-46 with 10:51 left with the Friars threatening to take command of the game. That’s when Minutemen coach Matt McCall called a timeout, leading to the defense locking in and holding Providence to just two points over the next seven minutes as UMass went on a 19-2 run to pave the way for a 72-63 upset victory. The timeout served as a time for McCall’s team to regroup and gather themselves for the final stretch.
Big Bets – If you want marketing to be valued, you have to understand, and link, to what the organization values. It’s that simple. If it’s market share, connect marketing objectives and activities to acquisition or account penetration, or both. If it’s profit, understand the drivers of profitability and align your teams’ efforts to those drivers. Plan top down, not bottom up. Big Strategy – Once you understand how to link marketing to the business objectives, your job is then to connect those big bets to day-to-day marketing activities.
With the 20th anniversary of the suicide of Kurt Cobain coming up next month, Seattle police knew they’d be getting plenty of questions about the Nirvana frontman. So a detective reviewed the case files – including evidence photos and statements. He found no new information to change the police conclusion that Cobain took his own life, but did discover four rolls of undeveloped film from the suicide scene. Late Thursday, Seattle police released two previously unseen images from those rolls. One showed a box containing drug paraphernalia, a spoon and what look like needles on the floor next to half a cigarette and sunglasses.
At 52, acting Gott’s age means fronting Montreal band The Ripcordz, lifers on a scene that did not, kids, come into existence with Reflektor. That’s punk rock. The Montreal band is “14-15 records” into a career. And after 34 years, you tend to get a few things right. And so the band self-renews, like punk itself. If you do, and you go, the band will be passing the hat around for kids arrested during a downtown March 15 protest against police brutality.
Kenya's ambassador to the UN Macharia Kamau. Photo | FILE. Kenya's United Nations envoy Macharia Kamau is leading a global effort in New York to promote the rights of people living with disabilities. Ambassador Kamau will chair a three-day meeting at the UN headquarters on June 10-12. As president of the conference of countries that have ratified a disability rights accord, he will moderate conversation on issues affecting one billion disabled people worldwide. In an interview with Nation.co.ke on Sunday, Ambassador Kamau said Kenya has made some progress in addressing the needs of its disabled citizens.
USC announced Thursday it would appeal NCAA sanctions it considers "excessive." And even before those plans became official, Trojans football coaches were calling recruits and getting out the message that the penalties could be reduced. "They're trying to appeal it and at least cut it in half," said incoming freshman Giovanni Di Poalo, an offensive lineman from Ventura St. Bonaventure High who said he spoke to Trojans line coach James Cregg. However, if recent history is any indication, Trojans players and fans shouldn't get their hopes up.
While he sat thinking about what he was going to write about SuperGiant, one of the longest lasting and most beloved local Albuquerque rock bands to pass through the ether and onto the Earth in the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico—part of the quadrant to which he was assigned more by fate than any editor—August March played the classic rock station, number 833, through his television, a Toshiba with great big speakers. So Billy Joel and then the Wings danced around his ears with stories of conquering the stranger or of the loneliness of the moon.
Hart Island as seen from City Island in New York borough of the Bronx in 2009. One of our deepest unvoiced fears in life can probably be summed up in one word: anonymity. Our best eternal hedge against that fear may be a simple gravestone, but many people who died in New York City don't get even that much. Instead, they're buried at Hart Island, New York’s cemetery for the indigent and unclaimed dead. It's the largest tax-funded burial ground in the US, and as many as one million people are buried there in mass graves.
It's no wonder that audiences have been clamoring for a Mirror's Edge sequel since its release in 2008. DICE's brief detour from their best-selling Battlefield series was a slick, inventive, and gorgeous video game. Unfortunately, it didn't sell well—not surprising for a $60 game that was only about six hours long. Mirror's Edge is a first-person action game about flow. It's at its most fun when you're climbing, jumping, and running your way through a virtual obstacle course. It stops being fun when you stop moving.
The noisy public debate about patients' out-of-pocket costs and their consequences reaches a crescendo when it comes to oral health and dental care. Nowhere are the growing inequalities in health between poor and rich, rural and urban, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, highlighted more than in dental health. An Aussie smile is an instant indicator of socioeconomic status, employability and self-esteem. It's also a predictor of physical health. The costs of this divide are revealing. Of the total annual spend on dental care ($9.9 billion in 2015-16), individuals contributed 58 per cent in out-of-pocket costs.
TWO late goals earned Llandudno Junction Ladies a 3-1 win over newcomers Denbigh Ladies in the semi-final of the Betty Pickering Shield. An early strike from Kat Godfrey gave the lead to Junction, who kept possession for most of the match with a hatful of attempts, but could not score a second goal to put the game to bed. Denbigh equalised late in the second half to force extra time. With a penalty shoot-out looming, Godfrey got her second goal deep into the second period of added time. Sarah Colville, on her remarkable comeback from injury, then added an excellent goal to give Junction a 3-1 win.
Will The Walking Dead's Anne Be In Rick Grimes' Movies? Rick Grimes' recent exit from The Walking Dead was only partly sad, as it was quickly followed by the announcement that Andrew Lincoln's character would return in TV films based within the show's universe. While Lincoln is going to be a part of that ride, other actors and actresses like Pollyanna McIntosh (Anne/Jadis) are still in the dark as to whether they'll be involved. McIntosh shared what she knows about the films, and gave a timeline regarding when she'll know if she'll appear.
Many are suspecting the worse when recalling that animals are often said to have a kind of sixth sense for disaster. They flee when something is about to occur. With the recent 4.8 magnitude earthquake in the vicinity of the super volcano in Yellowstone National Park, many have been on edge about a possible eruption of one of the biggest volcanoes on our planet. Others are wondering if the Bison are trying to tell us something. A visitor to Yellowstone National Park caught a stampede on camera, and now it has people wondering: Is the Yellowstone caldera is about to blow?
DAVID Beckham could return to the Premier League by the end of the weekend. David Beckham on his way by Sunday? Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp has been pulling out all the stops to ensure Becks comes to White Hart Lane. Redknapp claimed there was a "good chance" a deal would be made that would see David Beckham play for Tottenham on a two-month loan. “The clubs are talking and there is a good chance it will happen." It was believed that Becks was hoping to stay in London and make himself available for England selection again.
File photo from a well site in Cameron County. A group of religious leaders have called upon Gov. Tom Wolf to institute a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, citing Pope Francis' recent encyclical about climate change. The letter, delivered to the Governor's Office Thursday, was organized by the advocacy group Pennsylvanians Against Fracking and signed by more than 100 leaders of various faiths. "We do believe all of creation is a gift of God," said Sandra Strauss, an ordained Presbyterian minister and advocacy director for the Harrisburg-based Pennsylvania Council of Churches.
AUSTIN — The Texas Comptroller’s office recently released A Field Guide to the Taxes of Texas, a periodic report providing an overview of Texas’ major state taxes. The San Marcos Convention & Visitor Bureau (SMCVB) is now accepting nominations for the Rogers Family Tourism Awards. The Farm to Market Road 110 project is the subject of three agenda items for the Hays County Commissioners Court this morning. State Rep. Erin Zwiener filed a number of bills related to natural gas pipeline construction and safety, and one of them is about to get a hearing in the House Energy Resources Committee.
Studies have shown it takes eight weeks to change a sugar habit - here are the steps you can take. Studies have shown that we are consuming more than a kilogram of sugar per week. Studies show that it takes eight weeks to change a habit. "A glass of fruit juice contains the same amount of fructose as a glass of Coca-Cola." Fructose serves no purpose in our body. Standard table sugar contains 50 per cent glucose and 50 per cent fructose. When ingested, the glucose is used as energy and the fructose is converted to fat.
Cami Davre won her fourth consecutive title in both the 800 and 1,600, leaving the door open for an even more impressive feat on the second day of the state track meet in La Crosse. The name Cami Davre will forever be associated with La Crosse and Memorial Stadium, where the Whitefish Bay standout has now piled up 10 state championships in her storied distance-running career. There was one last loose end to tie up June 3. Davre, who won her fourth consecutive titles in both the 800 and 1,600 runs June 2 in the Division 1 state meet, had never competed in the 3,200 meters at state.
"There&apos;s not a reason in the world we can&apos;t grow at 4 percent a year," presidential candidate Jeb Bush said this week, "and that will be my goal as president." There are, in fact, plenty of reasons. I sincerely doubt the economy will sustainably grow 4% per year -- about what we achieved in the two decades after World War II -- any time in the coming decades, no matter who is president or what party they come from. Increase the productivity of that population.
Months of work by the London Planning Advisory Committee and its consultants on a strategic policy for high buildings in the capital have defined the problems and opportunities - all that is missing is some lines on the map. A second symposium on the draft proposals, held appropriately in the old NatWest Tower in the City of London last week, was able to take a more objective view of the consultants’ findings than shock horror headlines suggesting that businesses do not want high-rise. Businesses are not opposed to high buildings, but there is no evidence that height restrictions have affected London’s status as a ‘world city’.
The blue-chip average was down slightly Thursday, but it was set to cap January with its best annual kick off in close to a quarter century. As of 3:00 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 25 points, or 0.18%, to 13884, the S&P 500 declined 1.9 points, or 0.12%, to 1500 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2 points, or 0.06%, to 3144. The Dow has surged 6.2% this year, while the S&P 500 has rallied 5.3%. Both indexes are within striking distance of their record highs.

Tracy Morgan's lawyers filed a lawsuit against Walmart on Thursday following a traffic accident in June that left one person dead and the former '30 Rock' actor in critical condition. The Hollywood Reporter reports that the lawsuit is accusing Walmart of negligence which resulted in the crash. On June 7, a Walmart tractor-trailer being driven by Kevin Roper crashed into Morgan's limousine van carrying Morgan and other passengers. The crash resulted in a six-vehicle accident which killed comedian James McNair and left Morgan and his assistant in critical condition. Roper had allegedly been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the accident.
The first time I met Chief Presidential Legal Counsel and Spokesperson Salvador Panelo had me shivering in my bones. Having worked in government for ten years, I thought I had met every single genius there was to know – until I met the Chief. I was pretty much terrified as my answers to his questions seemed absolutely lacking all the time. My so called government experience literally took a different turn. I knew instantly I had to do some “shaping up” as obviously I was a bit rusty when it came to fully comprehending issues that involved the law.
We embarked on a new backpacking adventure with our family. This was the first time we packed it all into the woods with nine strong and supplies. I awoke to the sound of youthful chatter. As was later noted, Matthew had set his watch alarm for 5:37 a.m. (for reasons only a 10-year-old can understand), ushering in a twilight awakening on the northeast corner of the campground. Ten kids (three of which we inherited during the night) and two adults gradually emerged from four tents and set about rekindling the previous night’s fire from lingering embers.
Discussion in 'Standup Technique' started by Soap, Jun 24, 2008. I get younger weaker kids to start throwing combos at my head and i try to stop from blinking and keeping my eyes closed. It comes with experience, once you sparr enough you'll get used to it. A punch is going to hurt all the same whether your eyes are open or not. I don't think the eye-lid provides alot of padding. Just messing with ya. It is probably more of a reflex than anything. Eventually it will go away.
The Anti Malware Testing Standards Organization (AMTSO) is “an international non-profit association that focuses on addressing the global need for improvement in the objectivity, quality and relevance of anti-malware testing methodologies.” As such it serves a valuable purpose. Testing AV products is a difficult process with different testers using different criteria on different malware samples; and the same AV product can appear to perform very differently under separate tests. AMTSO was established to provide a level playing field for the vendors by establishing credible and accepted testing standards. The organization has been very quiet over recent months, with hints and rumors of big changes within.

Britain has to reduce its diplomatic staff in Russia by more than 50 people, the Russian foreign ministry said. Russia has told Britain it must send home "just over 50" more of its diplomats in a worsening standoff with Western countries over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the UK. The Kremlin has already retaliated in kind against Britain and ejected 23 British diplomats over the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. London says Moscow was behind the attack - an allegation Russia denies.
Betting on a full 1080p display partly justifies the Dell Venue 11 Pro's higher price compared to other Atom-powered tablets. But the keyboard dock add-on, which should turn this into a functional laptop alternative, is too expensive and occasionally frustrating to use. This tough, ruggedized tablet can survive some of the world's most extreme, hostile environments. The refined build quality and slick performance of the Dell Venue 10 7000 make it one of the finest Android tablet-hybrids around. The price difference between an Atom tablet such as the Dell Latitude 10 and a Core i5 one doesn't seem large enough to justify the performance gap.
Information about the 2013-2014 Co-Robots Program can be found in the flier HERE. The project will be carried out through the C-STEM Center and implemented in K-12 schools in the greater Sacramento region. A total of 22 math/CS/tech teachers in secondary schools in the greater Sacramento region will be recruited over the three year period as Robotics Fellows to participate in the project. They will implement the program in classroom, after-school, and out-of-school programs. Robotics Fellows will be trained with co-robot skills for classroom teaching with teaching resources and support of the UCD project team. Each Fellow will be provided up to $5,000 of robotics equipment.
Sophia Lillis is sticking with the horror genre. The It breakout actress is joining Oz Perkins‘ Gretel and Hansel, a reimagining of the classic fairy tale about two youngsters who run afoul of a hungry witch. Lillis played Beverly Marsh in It, and was recently seen in HBO’s thriller series Dark Objects. More on the Gretel and Hansel cast below. HBO adapts Gillian Flynn‘s Sharp Objects into a haunting, brilliantly constructed Southern Gothic miniseries. Director Jean-Marc Vallée deftly blends past and present, telling a hypnotic, engrossing story about a damaged woman who can’t escape her emotional and physical scars.
STOKE boss Mark Hughes has warned potential suitors off in-form Potters playmaker Bojan. The Spaniard has been linked with a string of Premier League clubs after a series of impressive displays for Hughes’s side. But Hughes says the former Barcelona man is key to his plans after Bojan linked up superbly in recent games with Xherdan Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic. Hughes said: “There'll be interest in him, possibly, but we won't encourage it. "If you look at what Bojan said this week, he said that he's very, very happy at Stoke.
Russ Feingold asks: “How can someone like Immelt be given the responsibility of heading a jobs creation task force when his company has been creating more jobs overseas while reducing its American workforce?" General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt is President Obama’s point person of job creation and economic growth. That may be the problem. While Obama says he wants to encourage the creation of family-supporting jobs and to grow the middle class, Immelt is all about enriching himself and growing the gap between rich and poor. With all that extra money, Immelt enjoyed a doubling of his personal compensation.
FYI, he was also on the basketball team. Point guard. With wife Judy, who he met at Harvard Business School, and told at a party one night "I&apos;m going home, and I want you to go with me." This picture may have been taken by classmates Jeff Immelt or Steve Mandel, which is awkward but can you blame them? The LL Cool J of his time. Over the past several years, much has been made about the supposed incompetence of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
To provide a safer environment for the public and significantly expedite fan entry into stadiums, NFL teams have implemented an NFL policy this year that limits the size and type of bags that may be brought into stadiums. The NFL Committee on Stadium Security in May unanimously recommended the implementation of this measure that will enhance public safety and make it easier for fans to gain access to all stadiums. One-gallon clear plastic freezer bag (Ziploc bag or similar). Small clutch bags, approximately the size of a hand, with or without a handle or strap can be taken into the stadium with one of the clear plastic bags.
President Barack Obama likely will directly engage in talks on cutting budget deficits, his spokesman said, after a deadlock over taxes caused two Republicans to drop out of negotiations led by Vice President Joe Biden. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican, cited an “impasse” over tax increases in announcing that he wouldn’t attend today’s planned negotiating session. Joining him in refusing to go was Senator Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican. They called for Obama to take the lead in the talks. The move caught Democrats by surprise and raised the prospect that the Biden-led talks could collapse over the tax issue.
A woman was left with multiple injuries after an attempted mugging in Crawley on Saturday. Police say that the victim - a woman in her 40s - was walking between Andromeda Close and Harmony Close, Bewbush, at around 5.10pm on Saturday when the attack happened. She was approached by two men, one of whom tried to grab her handbag while the other pushed her to the floor. She was left with ‘multiple minor injuries,’ say police. One of the men is described as white, in his late teens, wearing square-framed glasses and a black duffel coat with the hood up.
A 22-year-old man was running naked down a street in Florida when he was shot dead by a passing driver, according to police. Jandei Cherry, an aspiring musician and father, was pronounced dead October 6 from a gunshot wound to the stomach after police say he got into a fight with a stranger in Hollywood after running home naked at 5 a.m. The alleged gunman, 29-year-old Duke Laguerre, was driving down Hollywood Boulevard when police say he saw Cherry running naked. The alleged gunman told investigators that he was driving west on Hollywood Boulevard when he saw Cherry but initially passed him.
AUGUSTA, Ga. — Tiger’s back on top. In the final moments of the ceremony at the Butler Cabin, defending champion Patrick Reed took the green jacket and draped it on the new Masters champion, who looked a whole lot like an old one. Totally, completely, unapologetically, make-the-world-right fitting. Woods, who had made so much history at storied Augusta National, repeated history once more and in glorious fashion over a host of marquee rivals, winning his fifth Masters by a single stroke over three other players, including new No.
When the Ann Arbor, MI-based startup Larky launched its mobile app and website in April, its mission was to aggregate the many discounts offered by alumni associations, stores like Costco, organizations like AAA and AARP, and other groups looking to add value to their memberships. The problem, says co-founder Andrew Bank, was that Larky’s research found that 175 million people were members of at least three organizations offering member discounts, but 72 percent didn’t know what their discounts were or how to get them. Merchants also weren’t asking customers if they qualify for a discount at the point of sale.
Tottenham crushed Manchester United with a comprehensive 3-0 victory at Old Trafford this afternoon, handing the Red Devils their second loss out of the first three Premier League games. United manager Jose Mourinho—who’s coming off a tumultuous offseason and has a tendency to see his clubs implode in the third year of his tenure—is doing his best to put on a proud, happy face, and only really succeeding in coming off like a bit of a wacko. Then there was bargaining—United won the strategy and the tactics, but just not the score. Two out of three ain’t bad.
MLK Jr. Day was established as a federal holiday in 1983; Congress designated it a National Day of Service in 1994. For the fourth year in a row, volunteers came together to plant trees in East Palo Alto. They started out in Martin Luther King Park on Daisy Lane. On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, approximately 200 volunteers spent the morning spreading mulch, removing debris and planting trees in East Palo Alto. Environmental group Canopy provided the trees, emphasizing native flora. Young and old came together to plant the trees near the Bay Trail by San Francisquito Creek, where there has been flood protection work.
Letter writer says the political discourse should make all of us very afraid. Republicans being harassed out of restaurants. Yale dismissing class for students to protest Supreme Court nomination. Christians being called mentally ill. Men being presumed guilty just on the accusation of a woman. The media no longer presenting both sides of an issue. And the list goes on. Whether you are conservative or liberal, you should be very afraid now. Because soon, only those who agree with the extreme, socialist, radical, violent left will be allowed to speak or to serve.
Gatwick Airport has been accused of promoting its own business interests with ‘little or no concern’ for how its growth plans would affect the people of West Sussex. The airport’s draft masterplan was discussed at a meeting of the county council’s environment, communities and fire select committee, in Chichester. It lays out three possible expansion plans, including the conversion of the existing emergency runway into full-time use. The council will be submitting a response to the masterplan as part of a 12-week consultation, which ends on January 10, and members were asked for their views.
Barclays cracks top five FTSE broker rankings | City A.M.
BARCLAYS broke into the top five FTSE 100 stockbroker rankings last month, overtaking Deutsche Bank, fresh figures released today show. The British bank added two new blue chips to its roster of clients – supermarket giant Tesco and engineering firm Amec – to place it joint fifth in a list of the top brokers, ranked by the total number of FTSE 100 clients. JP Morgan Cazenove retained its crown as number one broker to the FTSE 100 despite losing two clients, dropping from 36 clients to 34.
As glimmers of hope go it wasn't exactly dazzling. If all goes well the weather over the forthcoming bank holiday weekend should become 'slightly more settled' and 'somewhat warmer and drier,' predicted the man from the Met Office. Current climatic conditions meant weather forecasters were 'not highly confident' about their predictions, many areas would still see some rain and only the south-east was likely to enjoy above average temperatures. It seems 'awful August', which is likely to be the wettest since 1912, is set to continue as it started, with depressingly damp and cool weather.
Every Marvel Cinematic Universe offering comes with its own unique tone and style, but comedy has always stood out as a critical element of each movie. These movies almost always come packed to the brim with gags, but few have ever reached the heights of humor in Peyton Reed's Ant-Man and The Wasp. Not only is it a hilarious movie in its own right, but it also offers up a perfect antidote for the overwhelming sadness of Avengers: Infinity War. On that note, and with the movie now in theaters, we have put together a list of the funniest moments from Ant-Man and The Wasp.
Senior White House officials, including Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, learned last month about a review by the Treasury Department’s inspector general into whether the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, but they did not inform President Obama, the White House said Monday. The acknowledgement is the White House's latest disclosure in a piecemeal, sometimes confusing release of details concerning the extent to which White House officials knew of the IG’s findings that IRS officials engaged in the “inappropriate” targeting of conservative non-profits for heightened scrutiny.
I have been reading the personal accounts from parents with regard to being separated from their children at the border of the United States. The stories break my heart. I am a therapeutic counselor and have worked with numerous adults who struggle in their adult lives with attachment disorders related to the early separation of parent to child, especially of mother to child. The anxiety caused by parent-child separation, especially at certain ages, is far-reaching and can lead to anxiety disorder, addiction and depression that follows the child throughout his or her life.
The Costa Rican Electricity Institute (ICE) announced Wednesday the launching of the fourth generation of telecommunications technology (4G) in Costa Rica. The new mobile network will begin operating on June 30. The new network will be installed one zone at a time, beginning on the west side of San José, in Escazú, Santa Ana and Pavas. Service will then extend to the east side of the capital, including Montes de Oca, Curridabat and La Unión, and eventually, all of the Greater Metropolitan Area by the end of the year.
President Donald Trump threw the G-7 summit into disarray Saturday, tweeting that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is "dishonest & weak" and that the U.S. was pulling back its endorsement of the group's communique in part because of what he called Trudeau's "false statements" at a news conference. Trump tweeted: "Based on Justin's false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S.
We need a new model for copyright and licensing issues, and the NLA cannot provide it, writes PRCA chief Francis Ingham. So. Copyright is back in the news. And not in the positive way it was when we defeated the Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA) at the European Court last summer. After a private collaboration, the CIPR and NLA sprung yet another new copying licence on an unsuspecting PR world. They described it as "a step forward". We described it as a massive error of judgement. Why? What can be wrong with another licence?
Now this is a lip sync battle. In a new ad for Doritos and Mountain Dew, which will air during Super Bowl LII on Feb. 4, Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage and acting vet Morgan Freeman face off in an epic showcase of rap — er, “rap” — skills. First, representing the new Doritos Blaze flavor, Dinklage mouths the words to Busta Rhymes’ mega-fast verse on the Chris Brown song “Look At Me Now” while walking through a fiery room that could be the handiwork of Daenerys’ dragons.
Family and coaches remember Bryan College signee BJ Lawrence as a good friend, hard worker. The former Siegel two-sport athlete died this weekend. Former Siegel High School athlete BJ Lawrence died this past weekend, his parents confirmed. "BJ loved everybody," his father Bobby Lawrence said. "He would give the shirt off his back to anybody." BJ Lawrence, 18, graduated Siegel in May, and had signed with Bryan College in Dayton to play baseball. He was part of the Stars baseball team, which won the Class AAA state title in 2016 and reached the state tournament this spring.
The “weirdest acquisition ever” – Broadcom's $19bn proposed takeover of CA Technologies – ran into a rather strange road-bump this week: a fake US military memo passed around American politicians on Capitol Hill. That bogus missive – apparently signed off by the Department of Defense – asserted that the acquisition faced a probe by the US Treasury's committee on foreign investment regarding national security concerns with the biz gobble, which was announced in July. That sent share prices of both companies into a brief dive, with Broadcom shedding 2.9 per cent and CA down 2.3 per cent.
There are three ways to get into college, the ringleader behind a massive college admissions scandal said in a Boston federal court on Tuesday. “There is a front door of getting in where a student just does it on their own. And then there’s a back door where people go to an institutional advancement and make large donations but they are not guaranteed in,” William “Rick” Singer told Judge Rya W. Zobel as pleaded guilty to four charges. “That’s what made it it very attractive to so many families. I created a guarantee,” Singer said.
Dr Annuar (front left) performs the Ngajat Meling Ranyai at Rumah Agnes. SIBU: The Sarawak government has approved RM2.235 million for repairs and upgrading work for 149 doors of the 34 longhouses in Nangka constituency. Assistant Minister of Housing and Public Health Dr Annuar Rapaee said RM15,000 has been allocated to each door. “The funds were approved last year, and repair and upgrading works are already in progress. The works are expected to reach completion by the end of this month,” he told thesundaypost after paying Gawai visits to five longhouses yesterday.
After a Jet Airways cancellation, where’s the promised compensation? Q. I recently flew from Paris to Mumbai on Jet Airways. My flight was delayed and eventually canceled. Jet Airways promised me $1,360 under EC 261, the European airline consumer protection regulation. I sent Jet Airways an EC 261 claim. Within three days, the airline responded, and it agreed to pay 600 euros to my wife and me. Jet Airways requested copies of our passports, the boarding passes, and our signatures on a release and discharge letter.
Though the primary season goes on for months, no single day will see as many contests as March 1, so-called Super Tuesday. More so than any other day, Super Tuesday gives candidates a chance to make a broad case about their nationwide appeal. Up to this point, contests have been taking place one at a time. Voting will take place in 12 states and the US territory of American Samoa, though not every state is choosing nominees for both parties. Only Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia will hold elections for both Democrats and Republicans.
With the Oct. 30 drop deadline for Fall Quarter courses nearing, Northwestern’s undergraduate schools announced a uniform course withdrawal policy this week, including a provision that allows McCormick students to drop individual classes for the first time. University Registrar Jacqualyn Casazza said the University is now ensuring all undergraduates who drop a course after the drop deadline will receive a withdrawal grade on their transcripts. In addition, there is now a defined period during which students can request to withdraw from a course, she said. Previously, Casazza said, there was no uniform course withdrawal policy among the six undergraduate schools.
Cardi B has shared the first picture of her daughter Kulture Kiari, just hours after announcing she and her husband Offset have split. The 26-year-old rapper took to Instagram on Wednesday to share the very first snap of her four-month-old daughter with the world, just 18 hours after she uploaded a video to the site announcing she and Kulture’s father Offset – whom she married in secret in 2017 – have decided to split. The Bartier Cardi hitmaker posted on Instagram earlier on Wednesday to reveal she and the Migos rapper had ended their relationship, after they “grew out of love” with one another.
BEIJING (AP) — China's factory activity shrank in December for the first time in more than two years, an official survey showed Monday, intensifying pressure on Beijing to reverse an economic slowdown as it enters trade talks with the Trump administration. The purchasing managers' index of the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing, fell to 49.4 from November's 50.0 on a 100-point scale. Any reading below 50 shows that activity is contracting. The December figure was the lowest since February 2016 and the first drop since July 2016.

The ride-hailing app Uber will continue operating in Costa Rica, as both the Public Services Regulatory Authority (ARESEP) and the Public Transportation Council (CTP) have ruled out blocking the software. The rulings, issued on Wednesday, responded to complaints from taxi drivers’ unions who demanded the agencies block the app. The unions maintain that Uber’s operations in Costa Rica are illegal. The agencies, however, concluded that they do not have the authority to block an app; currently, Costa Rica has no legislation allow them to do so.

In his post, Glokk is putting pen to paper on his contract. "@glokk9afnf 💰#Cashmoney," reads the caption under the video clip.
Though it has gained remarkably in spreading primary education and containing AIDS, India is unlikely to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for reduction of hunger as well as chid mortality, says the latest United Nations report. The Asia-Pacific Regional MDG Report 2011-12 that was released by Union Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh on Friday has pointed out that the progress towards achieving these goals are too slow to reach the target. One-hundred-and-eighty-nine nations in the year 2000 took a pledge to free their people from extreme poverty and multiple deprivations. This aim became the eight Millennium Development Goals to be achieved by 2015.

The Government is almost doubling a tax on international student fees for private tertiary providers, but has signalled that the tax could be tied to the quality of education in future. Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced the change to the export education levy this morning. For Private Training Establishments (PTEs), it will increase from 0.45 per cent to 0.89 per cent of international student tuition fees. For universities, polytechnics and institutes of technology, the rates will go from 0.45 per cent to 0.5 per cent. The levy is used for quality assurance and marketing, and also to reimburse international students caught out by programme and provider closures.
Kim Portrate, CEO of ThinkTV Australia, argues television can work in tandem with online-only channels to deliver the best results for marketers. About a million years ago, while proudly wearing the blue and white check uniform of my primary school, I learned some big life lessons. The first was that checks are definitely not my best fashion choice. The second, more important lesson was that when somebody asks if they can be your friend, the answer should always be “yes” – because nothing truly important is achieved without others.
Google to Step In on Microsoft/Yahoo Deal? Home →IT News & Trends →Google to Step In on Microsoft/Yahoo Deal? Search giant seen as trying to block Web mega-merger. Yahoo would consider a business alliance with Google as one way to rebuff a $44.6 billion takeover proposal by Microsoft, a source familiar with Yahoo's strategy said on Sunday. Yahoo management is considering revisiting talks it held with Google several months ago on an alliance as an alternative to Microsoft's bid, that source said. At $31 a share, Yahoo believes the bid undervalues the company, two sources said.
Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) on Thursday reported that quarterly sales at established stores in its U.S.-dominated Americas region slightly accelerated as it attracted more customers, who spent more during each visit. Shares of the world&apos;s biggest coffee chain were up 0.9% to $71.74 in extended trading after it also raised its full-year earnings forecast. Global sales at Starbucks cafes open at least 13 months were up 6% for the second quarter, versus analysts&apos; average estimate for a 5.4% gain, according to Consensus Metrix.

She was a former member of Longmeadow Church of the Brethren and currently a member of Bethel United Methodist Church in Chewsville, Md.
I came home one afternoon to find my husband sitting at the kitchen table, abruptly laid off from a job he'd held for almost two decades. He numbly talked about retiring. I immediately began to pray, making the transition to a calmer state of thought by being grateful for the many years of answered prayer I had witnessed in my life. I reaffirmed that whatever we did now would be done happily, under God's guidance. I even began to see this as an opportunity to relocate to a new area, closer to a loved relative, and to be able to spend more time with my husband.
French officials investigating the deadly Paris attacks on 13 November have identified most of the people they believe to have carried out the assaults, claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group. The attacks are suspected to have been masterminded by Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian national killed in a police raid in Saint-Denis, northern Paris, a few days later. Another key figure - Salah Abdeslam - was arrested on 18 March after going on the run. Mohamed Abrini, another suspect believed to have links to the Paris attack, was arrested in Brussels on 8 April.
PHOENIX — Ousted Arizona lawmaker Don Shooter is suing the state, claiming his rights were violated when he was expelled from the House of Representatives last year over sexual harassment allegations. Former state Attorney General Tom Horne filed the 41-page lawsuit Tuesday on Shooter’s behalf in Maricopa County Superior Court. It says the former Yuma legislator’s “constitutional rights to freedom of speech, equal protection, and due process and rights to public records” were violated. The state of Arizona, former Speaker of the House J.D. Mensard and Kirk Adams, former chief of staff for Gov.
Even as the Middle East plunged deeper into the maelstrom of fear, hatred, violence and despair, recent diplomatic developments, ironically, made the conditions for achieving peace tantalizingly real. Most notable, there was the declaration by the Arab nations meeting in Beirut of their willingness to recognize Israel, after fifty years of denial of its right to exist. Predictably brushing aside the Arab vision, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon revved up his tanks for a military solution, declaring a “state of war” with the Palestinians and invading the West Bank.

WORTHINGTON -- The Marshall girls basketball team isn’t typically known for its zone defense. But this season, head coach Dan Westby and the Tigers have used it more frequently. And their defense wreaked havoc on Worthington Friday night in a 69-47 Marshall victory. The Tigers made sure Othow didn’t have any easy looks in the post, forcing the Trojans to score in other ways. The game was close early, with the score tied at 5 with 13 minutes remaining in the first half.
Jason Webb announced his departure in a remorseful letter. BROOKFIELD - A senior leader of Elmbrook Church, one of the largest churches in Wisconsin, has resigned "due to multiple marital infidelities" and to seek inpatient treatment for an unspecified addiction. Jason Webb, senior church pastor for four years, announced his departure in a remorseful letter sent to the Elmbrook congregation Wednesday. Webb's resignation was tendered last week, church officials said. An interim senior pastor to replace Webb is expected to be chosen as soon as mid-next week by Elmbrook's council of elders, said Mark Heckman, the church's executive director of support services.
Betty Tremp waits for her lunch order as she and fellow members of Betty's by the Bay, a Traverse City group for women named Betty, met for the group's monthly lunch gathering at the Betty's Hot Dish food truck at The Lot on Eighth Street. The group, which meets on the third Thursday of the month, was started 14 years ago. "They're not naming kids Betty anymore," said Betty Plough, the group's founder. "I think just because it's just an old name.
If we speak about the last year concerning UX trends, such words come up in our minds as Artificial Intelligence, more intelligent personalization, and also Virtual Reality. What is more, it is worth mentioning the well-known word “Bitcoin”. Besides, UX trends of 2017 included minimalism regarding layouts. No matter where you looked, you could see the pixel-perfect illustrations in combination with videos. Additionally, the last year’s animations were quite well-done and functional. If we mention gradients, it is possible to say they were popular. What were the last year’s trends?
The Monster Beatbox may not deliver the most refined sonics, but if you're looking for big, aggressive sound from a small box, this is the one you want. The Monster Beatbox has a simple mission that goes something like this: deliver big sound from a small box. We'd call it monster sound, but the Beatbox doesn't quite go that far. But it certainly is compact and it certainly plays loud, filling even a fairly big room with sound. That in itself is an impressive feat, and the $400 Beatbox may just be the loudest-playing iPod dock for its size.
Lionel Sanders has gone from addict to Ironman champion. The winners of the Ironman 70.3 St. George celebrate with champagne. As Canada’s Lionel Sanders traveled up Snow Canyon State Park on his bike, he caught himself gazing at the red rock formations surrounding him and almost crashed. For a moment, the beautiful landscape proved to be a little treacherous. But it’s also one of the reasons Sanders keeps coming back. And the wins don’t hurt either. Sanders won the Ironman 70.3 St. George triathlon in a course-record 3:41:11 on Saturday.
Maria Panaritis, standing left, talks with old Beverly Hills Middle School metal shop teacher Jim Doyle. Imagine you are at lunch with 19 of your former middle school teachers. One shows up with a 1984 grade book with your test scores in it. Another, who helped you make bullets in metal shop, talks about how he used to prank that social studies teacher now holding your grades. The science teacher who made batteries from salt water and tin foil sits genially among them all. It is loud. Orders are flying for French onion soup, chicken dumplings, french fries, apple sauce.
In a nation whose modern history has provided little cause for celebration, there is always October. It was in October 1973 that the Egyptians and their fellow Arabs, so roundly defeated in every previous war with Israel, gained what they insist was a victory. And as the 25th anniversary approaches, it is clearly a memory that Egypt does not want a new generation to forget. A four-day ''silver jubilee'' that began today will feature a military parade, the first in 17 years. On Oct. 6, the anniversary of the day the war began, radio stations are to rebroadcast Communique No.
Shenseea recently signed a new contract with Campari. The deal will see the artiste participating in advertising campaigns regionally for the Campari brand.

Democrats smell an opportunity to define House Republicans as irresponsible and unready to govern when they vote on the specific details of their budget cuts in the next two weeks. Republicans are putting together their continuing resolution to keep the government operating beyond March 4 and have to translate Budget Chairman Paul Ryan’s (Wis.) cap cutting $35 billion from fiscal 2010 spending levels into the nitty-gritty legislative details. Democrats are gearing up to take on the cuts as extreme and damaging to a host of popular programs, according to leadership aides on both sides of the Capitol.
What Is a Ramp Up Period? A “ramp-up” period happens in business when the demand for a product or service is expected to surge. This could be before a product launch, before a major buying season (like summertime, back-to-school or holidays), or prior to a rebranding period or special promotional event. A ramp-up period typically requires a large amount of preparation, from product manufacturing to communications to marketing. During a ramp-up period in your business, you will likely need to increase your production efforts in order to satisfy the increased demand for your products.
Thank you. That two-word phrase can go a long way towards smoothing human communication and maintaining relationships. Yet in our hyper-charged, tech-centric world, that phrase often gets lost. In fact, I don’t see a lot of civility in my workaday life and I don’t believe I’m alone. Ironically, in this always on, never-out-of-touch world, it’s frequently much more difficult to reach people. Once upon a time people might hide behind a secretary’s clipped words to avoid answering a call. But at least you were talking with a human being.
September 30, 2004  The Justice Department continues to investigate possible accounting fraud by the mortgage finance company Fannie Mae. The investigation follows a report released by federal regulators last week alleging accounting irregularities. Hear NPR's Robert Siegel and Mike McNamee of Business Week magazine. September 30, 2004  Shares of Merck & Co. plummet after the company's annoncement that it is pulling Vioxx off the shelves. The company's blockbuster arthritis drug is sold in 80 countries and generates $2.5 billion in revenues. The news sent Merck shares down by more than 25 percent and reduced the company's overall market capitalization by $25 billion.

Down 24-6 with just over five minutes to go in the third quarter, the Chiefs rallied to tie the game and win it in overtime on a 31 yard field goal from Ryan Succop, as the Chiefs beat the New Orleans Saints 27-24 for their first win of the season. Drew Brees connected with Jed Collins on a six yard pass to give the Saints an 18 point lead with 5:36 to play in the third. 18 second later, Jamaal Charles ran for a 91 yard touchdown. Charles finished with 233 yards on 33 carries. Any doubts about his repaired ACL are gone.
The results appeared in a Google information box screen-captured by Vice Media on Thursday. Google quickly removed the section on ideology. Wikipedia’s publicly available change log shows that an anonymous user added the term “Nazism” to the entry for the California GOP on May 24. The change was reversed by another editor a week later. A second, similar change on Thursday afternoon was reverted a minute later. The California GOP has formally repudiated U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Little, who has praised Adolf Hitler and advocated for limiting the representation of Jews in the government.

The Indianapolis native and longtime WISH-TV journalist is moving on. After eight years of working as an anchor and reporter in his hometown, Julian Grace has announced his departure from WISH-TV. The Arsenal Technical High School and Ball State University graduate made the announcement Sunday morning on Facebook, stating that the Sunday broadcast would be his last and thanking the community for years of support. He also took time to reflect in a farewell video he shared with his followers. "See I was just a kid from the other side of the tracks who had a dream that maybe, just maybe, I could be a journalist in my city ...
Author Stefanie Chambers: "One of the factors is that you have an electoral system in the Twin Cities that allows underrepresented groups a chance at winning office." The latest study on Somalis in the United States supports a theory that nearly everyone in the community has heard before: that Somali-Americans in the Twin Cities are better integrated and more influential than their counterparts anywhere in the country. It was a theory that Stefanie Chambers, an associate professor at Trinity College in Connecticut, first heard in anecdotal form in 2012 when she was conducting fieldwork in Columbus, Ohio, for a book chapter about minority mayors in majority-white cities.
� Five to 20 percent of the U.S. population contracts the flu each year. � Around 200,000 people each year are hospitalized with the flu. � From 1976 to 2006, a low of 3,000 people and a high of 49,000 people died each year in the U.S. from flu-related symptoms. Still, not everyone gets vaccinated against the flu. That leaves the people who go without vaccines at risk, but it also makes the illness more likely to spread to others, including the very young, the elderly and those who have other health problems that leave them more susceptible to the flu.
Bing crossed the 20% threshold in search for the first time in March. That's according to a new U.S. desktop search report from comScore, released this week. But wait, it gets even more surprising. Since Microsoft (MSFT) also serves Bing results on Yahoo (YHOO) sites, the effective number of Americans using Bing is actually closer to 1 in 3. Google (GOOGL) remains the dominant search platform for desktop users, but its share slipped slightly late last year and has since leveled off at 64%.
Most of Slovakia's cities have undergone impressive revitalization projects over the past few years. The rebuilding of Košice's Hlavná ulica, Žilina's Mariánske námestie, and Nitra's Štefánikova ulica have breathed new life into these long-neglected city centers. But one of the first projects promising to energize to an entirely new section of a Slovak town is the Belveder Multifunctional Zone in the central Slovak town of Banská Bystrica. Built on a hilltop site where an auto campground stood until recently, Belveder is being developed by a company called IKM Reality-Staving to be "a city within the city."
WSWS reported that around one hundred coal miners at the Wongawilli mine near Wollongong, an industrial city south of Sydney, began seven-day strike action this morning. The workers are employed as casuals by CAS Mining, on behalf of Wollongong Coal. They are demanding a new enterprise agreement that guarantees job permanency and improved wages. The industrial action expresses growing anger among workers over wage levels, and opposition to a stepped-up offensive against conditions, amid a soaring cost of living. In a sign of nervousness within the ruling elite that the strike could become a focal point for broader discontent, the Murdoch-owned Australian newspaper prominently reported it on Friday.
Jersey’s Zachary Schaefer (21) congratulates teammate Sam Bartels after Bartels scored a goal in Monday’s 8-0 victory over Staunton in Jerseyville. JERSEYVILLE — Jersey boys soccer coach Scott Burney wanted a quick start from his team in its season opener Monday against Staunton. Jacob Liles obliged and the rest of the Panthers followed suit. Liles scored the first goal of the season in the fourth minute and the Panthers went on to roll to an 8-0 mercy-rule shortened game at JCHS. The Panthers were looking to implement the IHSA mercy rule by halftime, but came up a goal short.
Amazon thinks that volatile price swings in the boom-and-bust oil business are a perfect match for its web services cloud computing division. Perry's stance clashes with comments made by other members of his administration — including his boss, President Donald Trump. A State Department official on Iran says the oil market supply forecast for 2019 will exceed demand globally this year by 400,000 barrels, giving the U.S. more room to be aggressive on sanctions and try to take Iranian crude supply to zero. OPEC is seeking to change the way Americans think about the group, under threat of anti-OPEC legislation in Congress.
WASHINGTON -- House Democrats increased their efforts to defeat Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen this year, adding challenger Mikie Sherrill to their list of top challengers. Sherrill was one of seven candidates added Wednesday to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's "Red to Blue" list. These 18 Republican-held districts are where the DCCC believes it has the best chance of winning in 2018 and represent more than two-thirds of the 24 seats the Democrats need to pick up in order to regain their House majority. Such top-tier candidates get extra fundraising and organizational help for their campaigns.
The Huntington Beach Park where a man was allegedly beaten with a skateboard is no stranger to crime, according to police. "It's an area where we need to keep a high visibility of police presence," Huntington Beach Police Chief Ken Small said. "Those kinds of incidents can happen pretty quickly." Drug possession, loitering, battery and a single murder are among the crimes reported in the last five years.Nineteen counts of battery have been reported, five of them in 2012, along with eight cases of minors loitering and nine incidents of drug possession.
In 2014, trial lawyers opposing the retention of Illinois Supreme Court Justice Lloyd Karmeier spent $2 million attempting to defeat him. A national group funded in part by large corporate donations kicked in nearly $1 million to keep him on the bench and narrowly prevailed. Dark money can be dangerous in judicial races. The U.S. is in an era of high-priced judicial elections. It's hard to see how we can have judicial independence when judges depend on a handful of big donors to get them elected. The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized this, ruling that judges must recuse themselves when a case involves their giant donors.
None of Glenn Simpson's testimony supports the rickety Jenga pile of Republican theories implicating Clinton, Steele and the FBI. The transcript of the Senate intelligence committee’s interview with Fusion GPS director Glenn Simpson is now in the public domain, put there by a frustrated Sen. Dianne Feinstein in the wake of ongoing Republican conspiracy theories about what Simpson did or did not tell the Senate. Somehow, GOP critics of the Trump-Russia investigation have tried to put a positive spin on these materials, as if Simpson’s answers prove their point that the whole business is a witch hunt.
Properly sized stems allow you to position yourself comfortably on your road bike. 4 What Is a Carbon Footprint and Reduce It? According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, fossil fuel use for the purpose of transportation results in one-third of carbon dioxide emissions in the country. Of that number, nearly 60 percent of the carbon dioxide came from personal vehicles (See Reference 1). For a green alternative, riding a bicycle to run errands or commute to work emits no carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, but the wrong size bike can cause problems.
Environmental activist Yevgenia Chirikova said she was beaten and threatened in attempts to scare her away from the Khimki forest where she and other activists camped over the weekend to prevent loggers from starting work on an $8 billion highway connecting Moscow and St. Petersburg. Workers with the French company Vinci Concessions started to cut down trees in the forest just north of Moscow last week but suspended their work when Chirikova, head of the group In Defense of the Khimki Forest, and other activists demanded to see logging permits, which they promised to provide Monday.
Amanda Staveley has explained her infamous curry house meeting with Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley. Would-be buyer Staveley, Ashley and mutual friend Richard Desmond, a newspaper publisher, were photographed leaving a London restaurant last month. And news of the meeting raised hopes on Tyneside that a deal to sell the club was close. However, Ashley this week walked away from talks with financier Staveley. As indicated by sources close to Ashley, it wasn't a formal meeting, and Staveley has revealed that it was set up by Desmond. Photographs of the trio leaving the Hampstead restaurant were not published in a newspaper owner by Desmond.
Fat Friends The Musical has opened at Leeds Grand Theatre. Kay Mellor’s Fat Friends the Musical opened at Leeds Grand Theatre this week. So, was it worth the wait? And was it worth Kay Mellor leaving the world she knows so well and attempting to crack it in the world of musical theatre? In case you hadn’t guessed, I’m writing this before November 14, when the doors opened to the press and we were allowed a chance to see just what Mellor has been cooking up over the past couple of years (in between making various hit television shows).
Rush Limbaugh is safe. After telling his listeners that the warnings about Hurricane Irma were a scam to promote a climate change "agenda" and boost bottled water sales, he quietly scurried away to higher ground. Apparently, climate change is a liberal hoax so potent that not even Limbaugh could escape its reach. From record-breaking triple-digit heat in San Francisco to wildfires in Greenland, this is the summer when climate change has started to move into the realm of everyday experience. As a political strategy, climate denial was always a suicide pact, but no one expected the pills to start working so quickly.
A van struck a two parked vehicles, sending one about 20 feet down West Front Street, according to a person on the scene, and then smashed into the West Front Street entrance of Brothers Restaurant in Red Bank shortly before 9 p.m. Sunday.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Saturday offered Democrats three years of deportation protections for some immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in border wall funding, a proposal immediately rejected by Democrats and derided by conservatives as amnesty. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., dismissed the proposal as a “non-starter” and vowed that Democrats would pass legislation next week to reopen the government, putting the onus on the Republican-led Senate to follow suit. “The president must sign these bills to reopen government immediately and stop holding the American people hostage with this senseless shutdown,” Pelosi said.
COMSTOCK PARK – The Great Lakes Loons entered Friday night as one of seven teams in all of Minor League Baseball yet to hit a home run, but the drought ended in a 4-3 series-opening victory over the West Michigan Whitecaps. Jacob Amaya hit a two-run homer in the top of the third to tie the game at 2-2 after Luke Heyer was hit by a pitch. Niko Hulsizer's RBI double gave Great Lakes a 3-2 lead in the fourth. In the fifth inning, Heyer joined Amaya as the only Loons to go deep this season, making it 4-2.

Brisbane is on track to record its coldest days of the year this weekend, with overnight minimums expected to drop to just 6 degrees, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. It comes after parts of Queensland dropped below freezing on Friday morning, with the southern Queensland town of Roma hitting a low of -1.7 degrees at 6.20am. Brisbane reached a minimum of 11 degrees just after 7am on Friday while the Ipswich suburb of Amberley hit a morning low of 3.2 and Gatton, west of Brisbane, dropped to 4 degrees. Roma, 400 kilometres north-west of Toowoomba, was the coldest Queensland town.

The Scottish legal system is in the centre of much tumultuous change. An era of globalisation and the advance of artificial intelligence across the West makes it difficult to defend the centuries old independence of Scots Law and even the traditional role of the Scottish solicitor. Many of their proposals though seem out of time. The frustration of the Law Society of Scotland in their submission to the Scottish Government’s review of legal regulation is palpable and to an extent justified. Large international law firms with no organic link to Scotland have set up here in the last few years.
Advanced Micro Devices says its badly needed quad-core desktop processors are on the way, and they'll arrive bearing a new name. Later this year, AMD will unveil its Phenom processors in quad-core and dual-core iterations. Two quad-core chips will be available in the second half of the year, the Phenom FX and the Phenom X4, and a dual-core chip based on a similar design called the Phenom X2 will also appear by the end of the year. The Phenom brand will become the moniker for AMD's performance chips going forward, said Leslie Sobon, director of the company's desktop division.
A little bit of snow caused a handful of spinouts and accidents Friday night, including one that sent two high school students to the hospital with minor injuries. The Monroe County Sheriff?s Office responded to spinouts and fender-benders fairly regularly due to about an inch of snow that fell. One crash occurred on US-23 between Dundee and Milan involving seven St. Mary Catholic Central High School students. The teens were riding in a Ford Flex headed toward the basketball game at Milan against SMCC. At some point, the driver spun out on ice. The car left the road.
Set in a fictional city that teeters on the border of Canada and the United States, John Cariani's play “Almost, Maine” revolves around young adults discovering and dissecting love, one cold moonless night as the northern lights shine. Broken into nine 10-minute vignettes, “Almost, Maine,” opens discussions into the nature of love. “It’s romantic, not sentimental,” said Michael Carr, coordinator of theater programs at Shelton State Community College, and director of the production opening Thursday and running through Sunday, in Shelton's Alabama Power Recital Hall.
PORTLAND, Ore. — As the battle over Oregon’s recent delisting of the grey wolf as endangered is waged in a courtroom, the state’s lone Republican congressman helped convince the House to approve a plan to remove all protections for the species at the federal level. BUENOS AIRES, Argentina—Unearthed fossils from a carnivorous dinosaur that lived in Argentina about 90 million years ago show it had tiny arms compared to its body, scientists said yesterday. The team of scientists said the two-legged dinosaur was 20-26 feet long but its puny pair of arms only measured about two feet, or about the size of a human child.
It's been about a year since smartphone brand Infinix came to India. As an online-only player, it has dished out some pretty interesting offerings so far, the most recent being the Infinix Hot S3 (Review), which also won a coveted spot in our list of best phones under Rs. 10,000. That particular segment is already pretty crowded, with Xiaomi pretty much dominating it. Infinix now has a new model called the Hot 6 Pro, which targets users who are looking for a large display to enjoy content on. It’s priced pretty aggressively at Rs.
A woman who fell in love with a puppy whose photo she saw online was left “empty-handed and broken-hearted” after a pet-shipping company kept her money but never sent the purchased pug. The situation has prompted the Better Business Bureau in Albuquerque to issue an alert about the company – Mail Pet Express Travel Agency – which says it’s located in Santa Fe. The address it uses is actually “a million-dollar mansion that is listed for sale … and has no connection to a business breeding, selling and/or offering to ship puppies,” the BBB says.
Understaffed due to the shutdown, many National Parks are being trashed. The National Park Foundation is amassing funds–and volunteers–so the parks can recover once the government reopens. The current U.S. government shutdown–at over three weeks now and counting–is the longest shutdown in the country’s history. As President Donald Trump has brought the government to a standstill with his demand for $5 billion in funding for a border wall between Mexico and the U.S., some 800,000 government workers have been placed on furlough. A few have turned to the gig economy to bridge their lost income, and others have continued to work without a paycheck.
Richard Bolles turned job hunting into an art form. In 1970, the Episcopal priest self-published What Color Is Your Parachute?, a manual on how to look for work and change careers. The title was inspired by conversations with unhappy parishioners who complained they wanted to “bail out” of their jobs, and Bolles—who had shifted profession several times—offered folksy, practical advice about everything from how to identify your own talents to how to ace an interview. To Bolles’ enduring surprise, the book was picked up by an independent publisher and went on to sell more than 10 million copies worldwide.
Sen. Marco Rubio slammed former President Barack Obama’s Cuba outreach on Friday as he previewed President Trump’s policy overhaul in Miami, Fla.
Rubio said that Trump was welcomed by “dissidents” as he came down the steps from Air Force One on Friday in Miami, as opposed to Obama, who met with the Cuban government on a trip last March. The Trump administration’s new policy would restrict U.S. companies from doing business with Cuban ventures controlled by their military and strictly enforce rules on Americans traveling to the Communist nation. Rubio was an outspoken critic of Obama’s Cuba policy.
The Judge Rotenberg Educational Center (JRC), a special needs day and residential school in Canton, has been widely criticized for its use of electric shocks on students. In April, the FDA proposed banning "electrical stimulation devices used to treat self-injurious or aggressive behavior." The ban is specially aimed at JRC, the only facility left in the country using electric shock devices known as Graduated Electronic Decelerators, or GEDs. Reports have ranged from students being shocked 10 times in a row due to an equipment malfunction to 31 times in a seven-hour period for breaking JRC rules.
MADRID (AP) — Five European Union countries struck a deal Tuesday to distribute between them 58 migrants rescued in the Mediterranean Sea and left stranded by continuing disagreements in the bloc over how to cope with the influx of people trying to enter illegally from North Africa. A Spanish official who wasn’t authorized to be named in media reports said Spain, France, Portugal, Germany and Malta agreed to take the migrants, who were rescued by charities off Libya last week but then stuck on a private rescue ship because it couldn’t find a country which would let it dock.
Sydney’s Days Like This Festival has responded to criticism surrounding its all-male lineup for 2017. When originally announced in December 2016, this year’s Days Like This lineup featured 30 male acts (including the likes of Toro Y Moi, Kiasmos, John Talabot and Julio Bashmore) and only one female act in American musician ABRA, who later cancelled her trip to Australia due to a scheduling clash. In response to the criticism, Days Like This Festival organisers tell Music Feeds that they “appreciate the honest and open feedback regarding an issue which is a serious industry concern”.

Like Yaquina Head, Cape Meares has been stalked by persistent rumors that it was built on the wrong site. (TILLAMOOK) - The Cape Mears lighthouse at 34 feet is one of the shortest on the west coast. The lighthouse is located is on a high rocky cliff placing the light 217 feet above the ocean. The first order Henry Lapaute lens and 800,000 candlepower light is visible 21 miles at sea. The light was originally intended to be located on Cape Lookout but due to a map maker's mistake in reversing the two names, the construction was started on Cape Mears.
Devastating before and after pictures show the shocking toll that Hurricane Irma has taken on the Caribbean. Buildings have been completely destroyed, large areas flooded and severe damage caused by the 185mph winds that have ripped through the region in recent days. Shocking photos of the damage show how tourist resorts, hotels and bars on idyllic islands have been wrecked as Irma passed through on its way to Florida. The popular tourist destination of St Martin was one of the many to be devastated by the storm – with eight fatalities reported on the island.
A new Nato-trained security force has been launched in Kosovo, opposed by Serbia and some Kosovan Serbs. The 2,500-strong Kosovo Security Force (KSF) is meant to include some minority ethnic Serbs, but is expected to be dominated by ethnic Albanians. It replaces the Kosovo Protection Corps, which consisted mainly of veterans of the independence struggle against Serbia. Kosovo's February 2008 independence declaration was rejected by Serbia. The KSF will be engaged in tasks such as civil protection and crisis response. It is being overseen by Nato, which has 15,000 peacekeepers in Kosovo and will retain ultimate responsibility for security.
As I commented in my last blog, we so often know about cyber conflict when it goes wrong. It’s important to state right up front that there is no shame in being targeted and rarely shame in being compromised. The exception in compromise is when departments are lax or incompetent, which emphasizes the need for advanced detection, incident response and smart automation. Nevertheless, as Willie Sutton was famously misquoted saying when asked why banks are robbed “…because that’s where the money is,” in a very real way, being targeted is a consequence of success.
A new leak on how Facebook uses AI to predict users most susceptible to advertising has thrown trust in the social network back into the spotlight. The company has not been shy in discussing its work on artificial intelligence, which it uses in numerous ways to filter what it believes its users will be most interested in – and will keep them coming back for more. However, in the process it raises questions as to whether trust in Facebook has bottomed out, a matter which could be more damaging to its business than any fine levied by the FTC or other regulators.
Five civilians among victims of attacks following warning by rebel leader, according to Syrian state media. At least seven people have been killed in rocket attacks in Damascus, with at least 53 rockets fired on several neighbourhoods in the heaviest attack the Syrian capital has witnessed in recent years. State media confirmed that seven people - five civilians and two soldiers - were killed and dozens were injured in rocket attacks on Sunday. Some of the prominent neighbourhoods attacked included Malki, where the presidential palace is located; Abou Roumaneh; Mezzeh; and Baramkeh, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Drip Line, West Oakland’s newest cafe, flew under the radar until it quietly opened last week in the heart of the neighborhood. The small-batch outfit offers drip coffee and espresso, alongside seasonal breakfast, lunch, and grab-and-go menus. Right now, the daytime menu includes a fried egg sandwich bun starting at $9 (koji fried chicken is $4 more, bacon is $2 and avocado is $2), but also congee ($9), coconut grits with sambai shrimp and a fried egg ($13) and beef rendang ($13).
There has been an awakening at NASA. Have you felt it? The space agency, previously known as a haven for Star Trek fans, showed itself to be pretty well versed in Star Wars lore Thursday when the official poster for International Space Station Expedition 45 was revealed. As you can see below, it contains more than a few items not currently on the NASA roster — such as lightsabers, Jedi robes and, lurking behind one of the astronauts, some kind of large black moon. Expedition 45 will need a lot of Force on its side.
The response to our query last week to name a favorite cheese steak spot in New Castle County has resulted, not so surprisingly, in a deluge of email. We’re sifting through all the responses now and promise a follow-up soon. In the meantime, several readers like Raymond Snyder of New Castle wrote and called to say that Donna Kitts request for Neapolitan ice cream and hot waffle sandwiches may be a “shore” thing. Another reader called and said he recently spied those same waffle sandwiches on the Wildwood boardwalk, but kept walking because they were $5 each, which was too pricey for him.
John Travolta has said that working with Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst was “maybe my favourite experience I’ve had”. The film legend worked with Durst on the upcoming film, Moose. It’s co-written and directed by the rap-metal star and sees Travolta playing “a rabid movie fan obsessed with his favourite celebrity action hero”. It’s been reported that his character’s obsession “grows stronger, his fixation turns from stalking to ambition of destroying the star’s life”. The movie is said to have been inspired by the real-life story of a fan that once stalked Durst.
STILIYAN PETROV has been hailed ‘Superdaddy’ by wife Paulina after making an incredible return to the Aston Villa side. And she described him as a true role model. Petrov played in a pre-season friendly against GAK in Austria at the weekend after battling against Leukaemia. The Bulgarian is hoping to impress boss Roberto di Matteo enough to win a new Villa contract. But Petrov, 37, says he can find another club this season even there is not place for him at Villa Park. Petrov, affectionately nicknamed Stan by Villa fans, was told he would never play again after being diagnosed with the condition in 2012.
For the last time, Frank Charnley will play his handcrafted oboe to signal the audience at the Boston Pops and the millions watching that booming cannons and July Fourth fireworks are just a few beats away. Ba ba ba ba BOM BOM ba! Ba ba ba ba BOM BOM ba! After his performance in the climactic "1812 Overture" and the grand finale of the "Star Spangled Banner," the Framingham native will bid goodbye to 40 years with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and 25 years with the BSO's Boston Pops Esplanade Orchestra.
Ever since José Andrés and his small nonprofit group took it upon themselves to feed hungry Puerto Ricans following the near-knockout punch of Hurricane Maria last year, the celebrity chef’s name has been whispered in talk about potential nominees for a Nobel Peace Prize. Today, Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) confirmed that he has nominated the restaurateur and humanitarian for the 2019 award. Delaney, who has already announced his presidential campaign for 2020, said he could not discuss any specifics of his nomination or what motivated it. The five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the annual prize, discourages nominators from making any public announcements.
Security experts have made a breakthrough in their five-month battle against the Conficker worm, with the discovery that the malware leaves a fingerprint on infected machines that is easy to detect using a variety of off-the-shelf network scanners. The finding means that, for the first time, administrators around the world have easy-to-use tools to positively identify machines on their networks that are contaminated by the worm. As of mid-Monday, signatures will be available for at least half a dozen network scanning programs, including the open-source Nmap, McAfee's Foundstone Enterprise and Nessus, made by Tenable Network Security.
Reed's Ginger Brews has launched its first national cable advertising campaign in 25 years. The low-key, laid-back ad stars the company founder describing his love for ginger, promising viewers that once they try his ginger brew they will never drink ginger ale again. Visa has launched a quick toll that makes online shopping faster than usual. Visa Checkout lets consumers pay for goods online, on any device, with just a few clicks.

Headed To Mars? Watch Out For Cosmic Rays : Shots - Health News The dose of radiation an astronaut would experience on a trip to Mars is higher than the annual limit set for workers at nuclear power plants. But Mars enthusiasts say the radiation threat isn't high enough to cancel the trip. NASA's Mars rover Curiosity used its Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) to measure radiation exposure on the way to Mars. Now, it's recording similar data on Mars' surface. This image is a composite self portrait taken on Feb. 3, 2013.
Earlier this week I took a nostalgic tour of New Orleans in search of the remaining works by renowned British graffiti artist Banksy, who visited almost exactly five years ago. I found that three of the original 14 stencil paintings can still be seen. A few others are boarded up or painted over. In four cases, the buildings where the paintings appeared have been demolished. There’s a part of me that wished more Banksys were preserved. On the other hand, I doubt that the celebrated street artist intended New Orleans to be a museum; he intended it to be a social and political laboratory.
For 30 years Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and Nilima Rovshen were best friends, since their days as single professional women in Bangalore at a time when Indian career women were rare. After Rovshen was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002, Shaw watched her friend suffer through a long procession of chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. "She is someone I nursed for six years," says Shaw, India's first biotech entrepreneur. Shaw took her on a vacation to Spain for Rovshen's 60th birthday. She died a few months later after whole-brain radiation therapy.

The Departments of Education and Justice have teamed up to make the lives of students in tough neighborhoods even tougher. Framed as a measure to combat discrimination against black and Hispanic children, the guidelines issued by the Obama administration about school discipline will actually encourage racial discrimination, undermine the learning environments of classrooms and contribute to an unjust race-consciousness in meting out discipline. Claiming that African-American and Hispanic students are more harshly disciplined than whites for the same infractions, the Obama administration now advises that any disciplinary rule that results in a "disparate impact" on these groups will be challenged by the government.
Police in Lancaster County are looking for the driver who struck a woman crossing a road Friday morning. Claudia Santini, 45, of Lititz, told police her back and hip/leg were injured in the incident around 10:17 a.m. Friday, Northern Lancaster County Regional Police said. Santini told police she was crossing Owl Hill Road from the south to the north around Shober Lane, and had almost completed crossed when she was hit by a black sedan, believed to be a Toyota. She said westbound car had slowed for a line of cars, and then sped up before it hit her on the right passenger side.
In this first image, we have June standing alone, stripped of the red garments and cap that have become iconic to the series. She's also drenched in blood on one side, but she doesn't seem to have a wound that could have led to that much blood loss. The angle of the blood spatter may indicate that somebody next to and taller than her was terribly injured. Then again, maybe she finally snapped and let loose on somebody, which would be totally understandable after her experiences in Season 1. Alternately, this photo could be of June prior to her final transformation into a Handmaid.
After recording the biggest turn-around season in program history, the Eastern Michigan University volleyball team was looking to build on past success. And that it did. The Eagles finish the season with a 21-11 record (9-7 in the Mid-American Conference) after being knocked out of the MAC Tournament. The Eagles lost 3-1 to Ball State in the first round of the tournament. Coming into the season the Eagles were faced with the challenge of replacing senior middle block Jenn Schwartz, who graduated in 2011. In the opening matches, freshmen Megan Crawshaw and Katherine Krasowski fought for the spot, and in the end Crawshaw proved herself worthy.
A Maine judge on Friday ruled in favor of a nurse who defied a quarantine in a tense standoff with state authorities, saying local health officials failed to prove the need for a stricter order enforcing an Ebola quarantine. Her attorney, Norman Siegel, called the decision a victory. Go Kaci Hickox. Ride your bike. Take walks. Order pizza. Talk to reporters. Behave the same as any healthy, free, liberty-loving U.S. citizen should behave. And, by all means, follow the same procedures that U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power and others who have traveled to West Africa are following.
Local authorities in England say some parents are being “coerced” by schools into home educating their children, often before GCSE exams, and that there has been a sharp increase in the number of pupils being removed, according to the government’s admissions watchdog. The annual report of the Office of the Schools Adjudicator (OSA) says more than 52,000 children were registered as being home schooled in 2017-18, using figures supplied by the 152 local education authorities in England. But it notes that, because there is no requirement on parents to register, the figure is an underestimate of the real total.
Netflix’s “Sandy Wexler” is an example of everything that’s wrong with what Adam Sandler is doing under his own initiative and everything that’s right with his artistry. Adam Sandler is a vastly talented actor who is a victim of his own success, which generally keeps him working in a wan comedic mode with directors of little inspiration. The outstanding exception, to date, is his performance in Judd Apatow’s “Funny People,” which showed what happens when he works with directors who tap into the depth of his talent.
Even with modern equipment, digging tunnels is hard work. It took Swiss engineers 14 years to dig the world’s longest rail tunnel, the 57-kilometre Gotthard Base Tunnel under the Alps. It was finished in 2010, but construction began in 1996. The Zambian mole rat doesn’t dig all the way through mountain ranges, but it does dig some of the longest tunnels in the natural world, and the longest of any non-human mammal. A single underground colony can stretch for 2.8 kilometres. Yet on average, each colony contains just nine or 10 mole rats.

The Warriors are winners of eight straight games after Monday night’s win over the Lakers in Los Angeles, Klay Thompson is on fire, DeMarcus Cousins has been a tremendous edition, and Draymond Green is playing his best basketball of the year. But amid all of those good vibes, something negative popped up in Tuesday’s blowout win over the Lakers, when Jordan Bell and Warriors coach Steve Kerr were caught by TNT cameras in a fourth-quarter sideline spat. Is there cause for concern in Golden State or is this nothing to worry about?
Lamar Odom was stunned to find out during a recent episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians that Khloe had been “fake trying” to have a baby while she was in a committed relationship with the NBA player. Lamar, who reportedly caught the episode, wasn’t aware of the fact that Khloe Kardashian had no intentions of starting a family with him, and that’s despite the fact that she had done plenty of interviews at the time, stressing how she couldn’t wait to be a mother and settle down with Odom.
Haha, so here’s some fun news: the National Defense Authorization Act that passed last week included a provision that empowers the president to effectively control a taxpayer-funded global media arm. What could possibly go wrong? Politico reports that a quiet provision on page 1,404 of the National Defense Authorization Act, propelled by House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce, will disband the bipartisan board of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, an independent U.S. agency that helps maintain the journalistic integrity of external broadcasting institutions including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcast Networks.

Bakersfield's Board of Zoning Adjustment has turned down a developer's proposal to build a pair of five-story student dormitory buildings on 6.45 acres of vacant land at the northeast corner of Coffee Road and Stockdale Highway. The proposal would have replaced plans for three two- or three-story office buildings at the site, which is located across Coffee from Town & Country Village Shopping Center.

Artashes Geghamian, the outspoken leader of one of Armenia’s two main opposition groups, set on Friday his conditions for endorsing constitutional changes drafted by President Robert Kocharian and his leading political allies. Geghamian said his National Unity Party (AMK) will urge supporters to vote for the proposed amendment at a referendum in November if the authorities pledge to call fresh parliamentary and presidential elections in case of its positive outcome. He said the constitutional reform should be followed by the election of a new Armenian parliament that would form a government which would in turn hold a “free, fair and transparent” presidential ballot.
"I support you. I'm here for you." I heard myself saying this to my client, but I was feeling less and less sure about it. I wanted him to succeed, to turn things around in his classroom, to learn and grow and actualize his goal of becoming a strong and effective teacher. But how much—and for how long—could I ethically "support" someone whose challenges were so directly and so adversely impacting so many eighth-grade students? I subscribe to Elena Aguilar's model of transformational coaching: Effective coaching can guide clients to change not only their behaviors but also their beliefs and ways of being.
BUCKLEY Town Vipers hauled themselves level at the summit of the Clwyd Junior League Under 14s Division with a 10-1 victory at Aston Park Rangers on Saturday. Man of the match Connor Littler, Ellis Jones, Jared Jones, Joel Williams, Rhys Wingeatt, Sam Hibberd, Sam Woodward and Jamie Wynne shared the strikes for the Vipers, who now have 15 points to their name along with table-topping Mold Juniors and third-placed Greenfield. Luke Hall offered Aston’s consolation from the penalty spot. Ewloe Harriers were also in free-scoring form as they won 10-1 at Aston Park Rangers to move up to second in the U12s Division.
Glaser reunites with his old colleague Hernan Lopez at the startup. Podcasting startup Wondery has hired Fox programming veteran Jeffrey Glaser to oversee content. The company, founded by former Fox International Channels CEO Hernan Lopez, has tapped Glaser as its first president of content, in charge of developing both scripted and real-life programming.

News stories told of Vidak's "convincing victory" over Kern County Supervisor Leticia Perez of Bakersfield, a Democrat, lawyer and former state legislative aide. Believing that she had lost the election, Perez even conceded the next day, and Vidak received a congratulatory phone call from the opposing team -- Senate Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento. But when all the votes were tabulated, Perez had forced Tuesday's runoff election by a mere 114 votes out of 63,448 cast. Fresno's Measure G election on June 4 to decide whether a private company would take over garbage collection from city employees wasn't that close.
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- Nearly a week after a two-vehicle collision killed two on University Parkway, a third person has died. 74-year-old Florence Boothe, of Mount Airy, was sent to the hospital for her injuries after the collision on Aug. 29 and died Saturday. Two other people died at the scene. The crash happened at 1:48 p.m. on University Parkway at U.S. 52. Boothe, who was driving a Nissan SUV, was driving on University Parkway when she turned left onto the ramp to U.S. 52 North, according to a news release from Winston-Salem police.
In thinking about the American idea, we decided to revisit a concept we first took up in these pages 25 years ago. Scholars, novelists, politicians, artists, and others look ahead to the future of the American idea. Americans value both order and freedom, and drawing a line between the two is no easy task. This may seem especially true where the more routine aspects of public order are concerned: How much freedom must be sacrificed in order to have quiet streets free of graffiti, aggressive panhandlers, prostitutes, and teenage gangs?
One of the most talked about and controversial outings from Ubisoft in the Assassin's Creed franchise has to be Assassin's Creed: Unity. The game was hailed as a gorgeous but broken gameplay experience. Well, Ubisoft finally explained exactly what went wrong. We fell again into this trap of working a lot on the tech, and not allowing enough [time for] the teams to create the content to create something new. In the end, that's the way I see it. We created the perfect conditions for the perfect storm.
AIDS prevention research has established the effectiveness of multiple component group interventions. It has not identified whether the effectiveness is due to the format of the intervention (i.e., rehearsal, feedback, etc.) or its instructional content. This study investigates the impact of instructional content delivered in the inexpensive and readily obtained printed medium. Thirteen gay or bisexual college-aged men received an information pamphlet and an AIDS-related communication skills training booklet. Subjects were evaluated on measures of knowledge, safe and risky behaviors, and communication behaviors in each of three assessment sessions.
The United States’ competitiveness among global economies has risen to the No. 3 spot behind Switzerland and Singapore in rankings published annually by the World Economic Forum. In its survey released yesterday, the Forum said the U.S. — the world’s largest economy — moved up two spots from fifth position last year, thanks to improvements in its financial markets and public institutions. Six European countries dominated the top 10: Switzerland, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Sweden. Aside from the U.S., the remaining three slots were Asian: Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong.
A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Daily Star on March 07, 2018, on page 14. Cristiano Ronaldo and Casemiro got the goals for Real Madrid as the holders won 2-1 away to a Paris Saint-Germain side missing Neymar to secure their place in the Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday. Edinson Cavani equalized on the night for PSG, but only after they had Marco Verratti sent off, and Casemiro's late goal secured an ultimately comprehensive 5-2 aggregate victory for Zinedine Zidane's side. The goal had come from an error by Dani Alves initially, and it punctured PSG and the atmosphere.
The $3.2 million campaign to open a second slots parlor in Massachusetts has been secretly financed by a team of developers who brought gambling to Maine and whose casino in Laos was seized by the government last year amid corruption allegations, new campaign finance documents show. The documents not only show new spending on the ballot measure by the casino developers, but also revise an earlier filing to show that they have been funding the campaign since its earliest days, contradicting claims by the measure’s chief promoter. The revised filing reports that much of the financing came from Bridge Capital LLC.
Patrick “Pat” McCormick of Crawfordsville passed away at home. He was 70. Pat loved to tinker and invent. He was a free-thinking “outside-the-box” type of guy that encouraged his family to do the same. He was a member of the Elks, Masonic Lodge and Vietnam Veteran’s Association. He served his country in Vietnam in the U.S. Army. After coming home, he started work at the McCormick-Metsker Agency and sold real estate. He opened the McCormick Companies, doing electrical, heating and air, and alarms. There wasn’t anything he couldn’t fix.
Well, don’t say we didn’t warn you. Governor Kulongoski sold us a bill of goods. Put credit where credit is due. The “daily fishwrapper”, the rapidly declining Oregonian newspaper, did some great investigative reporting over the weekend. I’ll give them credit for that. They found all the numbers. How Governor Tax-And-Gouge-Me phonied up the numbers to make sure the Oregon Legislature would pass a package of bills. It rapidly expands the tens of millions of dollars being poured into (so-called) green power.
This attends his posting style.... long before his posts hit "Best Of" and can be recced by folks from other boards. I laugh at a lefty poster a week or so ago who complained about LL for the same reason as you are doing now. Lo and behold through the dead of night his post was on the best of by morning. When I chided him about it the next morning his answer was something like, 'I'm popular'. Well so is LL, so eat your jealous heart out bill...LL is popular too.

The discussion comes in the wake of a shooting on Friday at Santa Fe High School that killed ten and wounded 13. Reynolds-Perez said in the Facebook post that the Tuesday discussion in the governor's office also will include a superintendent, a police chief and a few other leaders.
“We want Rand!” rang through the crowd midway through the main debate. Simultaneously, #RandRally popped up on Twitter. Graham may no longer be running for president, but he hasn’t been forgotten. Graham, the home-state senator in front of the South Carolina crowd, was a delight in earlier undercard debates, bringing to bear a lighthearted wit that belied his dark outlook on national security. Ted Cruz: Did not answer the question. But he did call for a ban on refugees coming from countries, such as Iraq and Syria, where ISIS controls significant territory.

Sleek, hard, but also a winkie – how comedian Daniel Barker sees car adverts. Comedian Daniel Barker is gaining traction on social media through his on-point spoofing of automobile advertising that often uses toxic masculinity to sell cars. Advertising that works. I am me. A serious man. Moving through fields and towns. Capable of financing a small family and transporting them from A to B. The features of this car are interchangeable with my masculine provider identity. Shielding. Understated. Silver. Humiliating to other fathers. Totally unnecessary to my family’s requirements.
RICHMOND, Va. — Dominion Resources has shed some more light on its plans to change the downtown skyline. The Richmond-based utility giant announced Thursday it will build a 20-story, 908,000-square-foot office tower at 111 S. Sixth St. The high-rise will replace the existing six-story, 269,000-square-foot Richmond Plaza building, which sits across the street from Dominion’s One James Center Plaza headquarters and has been largely unused since the company bought it from Washington, D.C.-based real estate firm Douglas Development in 2011. The company said it is also considering building a separate, neighboring tower on the site of its current headquarters, which sits at 701 E. Cary St.
THE $150 billion three-year compromise deficit-reduction package hammered out over the weekend by President Reagan and GOP senators deserves the broadest support from Capitol Hill. At the very minimum, a package along the lines of the consensus agreement should be enacted into law. Even better, lawmakers should aim higher - at, say, a $200 billion package, as now proposed by Democrats and desired by many Republicans. What's going on in Washington, it becomes increasingly clear, is a contest of one-upmanship. In his State of the Union address Mr. Reagan called for a $100 billion deficit-reduction ''down payment.''
Forget the war in Iraq, the war on terror or any other war against which Connecticut citizens are said to have voted by defeating Joe Lieberman and nominating Ned Lamont for the U.S. Senate. The operative war for American citizens is something closer to home -- a war of independence from the bickering partisans who have made political life in America a childish and tedious exercise. Democrats aren't wrong when they say that the Lamont victory was a defining moment. It defined the Democratic Party as a vigorous, motivated, organized force that is . . . completely out of touch with mainstream America.
The clinical-stage biotech's third-quarter report contained some important pipeline updates. With a single $5 million payment from a collaboration partner, the earnings portion of AnaptysBio Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ANAB) third-quarter report didn't contain a lot of details. On the development side, though, the company moved both of its clinical-stage candidates closer to the goal line while collecting plenty of capital to get the job done. What happened with AnaptysBio Inc. this quarter? As promised earlier, the company's ANB019 program began a placebo-controlled 50-patient trial with palmoplantar pustulosis patients.

Divide was founded with a simple mission: Give people the best mobile experience at work.
In early 1939, peace activist Clare Hollingworth arrived on the Polish-German border to aid Jews and other refugees fleeing from the Sudetenland, newly annexed by Nazi Germany. On a brief return to her native England, the 27-year-old Hollingworth — who once professed to “enjoy being in a war” — was hired as a part-time correspondent in Katowice, Poland, for the London Daily Telegraph. After three days on the job that August, the cub reporter landed one of the biggest journalistic scoops of the 20th century: Hitler’s imminent invasion of Poland, marking the outbreak of World War II.
Smore, a startup which lets anyone quickly build attractive, single-page websites which it calls flyers, is rolling out a new version of its service today to specifically targets mobile app developers. Called simply “app flyers,” these mini, customized websites can be built in seconds by pulling in data from the App Store itself, then allowing users to tweak the design using a handful of built-in styles. Smore, a TechStars Seattle 2011 alum, launched into public beta this April, and now has over 10,000 users on its service, who have produced 8,000 flyers.
RICHMOND COUNTY, NC -- Four people were killed and dozens injured Saturday when a charter bus carrying a South Carolina private school's football team crashed in North Carolina, WTVD reported. The Ramah Jucco Academy football team was traveling from Rock Hill, South Carolina, to play the University of God's Chosen in Fayetteville, North Carolina, when it hit an overpass bridge on the Highway 74 bypass in Richmond County near Rockingham, WTVD reported. All 42 people hurt in the crash, including the Ramah Juco coach, were taken to area hospitals, WTVD said.
The Kremlin's decision to try to draw a veil over Lithuania's independence crisis by ridding the republic of foreign journalists amounts to a tribute of sorts to the increasingly fragile presidency of Vytautas Landsbergis. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's sensitivity to the notoriety that has accrued over his handling of the crisis. It also suggested that Mr. Landsbergis might at least be holding his own within his odd little Alamo of public relations monologues that keeps him going through one uncertain day after another. Today once again demonstrated the delicate health of Lithuania's claim of independence.
It takes more than blast-furnace heat to depress community spirit in Gurnee. More than 8,000 people braved a heat index of 106 to see friends and exhibits and join in the numerous activities held in Viking Park last weekend. The events, which included a young artist's show, baby and bicycling contests, community dance and stage events, were part of the 23rd Annual Gurnee Days. Sunbonnets protected the red-headed Wismer girls, Shalyn, 3, and Kristin, 2, of Gurnee as they waited under midday sun to ride their trikes on stage in the bicycle and buggy contest.
Rockland — Maine-based nonprofit WindowDressers coordinates community volunteers to build affordable, re-usable, interior insulating window inserts that tighten up existing windows. The cost of the insert depends on the size of the window, but averages $25 for a medium-sized insert in natural pine. Twenty-two percent of the inserts built are reserved for low-income customers for a small donation. Go to windowdressers.org or call 596-3073 to sign up. Volunteers are needed now through December at the Lincoln Street Center, 24 Lincoln St., where lumber for the inserts is cut, drilled, and assembled before being sent out to the 27 Community Builds across the state.
The former Half Hollow Hills West standout scores 25 points and adds six rebounds and three assists before family and friends in a victory over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. Tobias Harris sat in the visitors' locker room at Madison Square Garden checking – and then re-checking – the stack of tickets left in his name. Despite bouncing from Milwaukee to Orlando, from Detroit to Los Angeles, and then, last week, to his newest stop, with the 76ers in Philadelphia, there is no denying he’s still Long Island’s hometown star.
The World Jewish Congress urged Europe's governments to consider a ban on far-right parties, at the end of a conference in Budapest. The World Jewish Congress (WJC) urged Europe's governments on Tuesday to consider a ban on far-right parties, at the end of a three-day conference held in Budapest. The WJC, which represents Jewish communities outside Israel, adopted a resolution calling on governments in Europe to "consider banning neo-Nazi parties or organizations whose aim is to overthrow the democratic order, or which pose a threat to the safety and well-being of ethnic, religious or other minorities," according to AFP.
The Council of PR Firms yesterday urged PR firms to "pledge" to Wikipedia that they will only submit materials to the hidden "Talk" pages where posts can languish for long periods and which are supervised by anonymous "editors." Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, has decreed an end to arguing over whether Gregory Kohs should have been allowed to speak at WP’s meeting May 30-June 1 at New York Law School. It has been a momentous June 2014 on Wikipedia for those who follow the endless battle over encyclopedia content that is generated by public relations professionals.
In the early 80s, MS-DOS defined the basics of computing. Purchased by Microsoft in 1981 from Seattle programmer Tim Paterson, it was mostly a clone of an earlier released operating system called CP/M. But Microsoft's purchase gave it the browser it needed for IBM's Personal Computer, Big Blue's first attempt at the home computing market, and it went on to become iconic just through the sheer number of people using it. There were games of course, but a computer is more than games. Which is why Nostalgia Nerd shows the various MS-DOS web browsers that people had to actually use.
This afternoon, Mr English emerged from the National Party's first caucus meeting since it learned it would not be in government and told waiting reporters he was still in charge. "I can confirm that today the National Party caucus re-elected me as its leader, along with Paula Bennett as deputy leader. "I have committed to leading the National Party into opposition, we are the strongest opposition a New Zealand parliament has seen, we will go into the House with more seats than the Labour-New Zealand First coalition government," Mr English said.
You don't want to miss this one. On June 29, Netflix added a truly special new documentary to its online streaming roster. The Netflix Original Recovery Boys follows the journey of four young men affected by America's opioid crisis as they fight for recovery at Jacob's Ladder Rehabilitation Centre in West Virginia. The four young men — Jeff, Rush, Adam and Ryan — learn to open up about their feelings and their torment as they work on Jacob's Ladder farm. Together, they make hayrides, feed and tend to the farm animals and till the land.
The doors had only just opened on Thursday afternoon at Fan Expo Canada, but already crowds were swarming around the famous DeLorean time machine from Back to the Future, now being used as a fundraising tool for the Michael J. Fox Foundation in its fight against Parkinson’s disease. It proved that the draw of the Back to the Future film trilogy is as strong as ever, and a good bet that Sunday’s 3 p.m. Q&A session with Christopher Lloyd, the film’s beloved Emmett “Doc” Brown, is likely to play to a packed house.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek youths clashed with police in central Athens on Monday as a protest against education reform turned violent when it reached parliament’s Syntagma square. Protesters threw stones, flares and petrol bombs at police who responded with teargas. The incidents occurred during a march by students to parliament, protesting against a draft bill changing university entrance requirements. Reuters witnesses saw at least three petrol bombs hurled by demonstrators, who also threw flares. Police responded with rounds of teargas. The incidents ended almost as rapidly as they started and the central square soon opened up for traffic.

The instant you look at Kate Burton, you know who her father is. Her father was Richard Burton. Her mother is Sybil Burton, the late actor`s first wife, who, in the mid-1960s, achieved fame as the proprietess of the popular New York disco Arthur. Considering that her father played Hamlet, Mark Antony, Faust and Henry VIII, Burton is as surprised as anyone that she`s making her feature debut in ''Big Trouble in Little China'' (she appeared with her father in the TV mini-series ''Ellis Island'').
Oy vey and Jesus H. Christ. Whether that happened or not neither I nor anyone else at the rally who doesn’t speak Arabic could say—and as such I seriously question if the ADL has good information on it. If it did happen, anyone in their right mind would say it was anti-Semitic plain and simple. There’s nothing uniquely “progressive” or “left” about its hatred, and therefore there’s little need for a special conference. Nasty stereotyping and anti-Semitism does occur among those who consider themselves politically pure, just as homophobia does.
Pope Francis is planning a visit to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia next year, when the three Baltic nations celebrate their 100th anniversaries. Janis Siksnis, an adviser to Latvia’s president, confirmed it to the Associated Press on Thursday, saying no other details were yet available. A spokeswoman for Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, Daiva Ulbinaite, had earlier told the Baltic News agency that the visit was scheduled for the autumn of 2018. The agency said the Vatican would soon announce exact dates for the trip. It would be the second time a pope has visited the Baltic countries.
Are All Psychiatric Drugs Too Unsafe to Take? Psychiatric drugs are more dangerous than you have ever imagined. If you haven’t been prescribed one yet, you are among the lucky few. If you or a loved one are taking psychiatric drugs, there is hope; but you need to understand the dangers and how to minimize the risk. The following overview focuses on longer-term psychiatric drug hazards, although most of them can begin to develop within weeks. They are scientifically documented in my recent book Psychiatric Drug Withdrawal and my medical text Brain-Disabling Treatments in Psychiatry, Second Edition.
Kenny Au is an artificial intelligence and blockchain entrepreneur. Cryptocurrencies set striking records in the year 2017. The values of major cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple skyrocketed so high that those who had invested in them earlier felt on top of the world and those who hadn’t felt that they had missed out. On December 17, 2017, the value of Bitcoin had risen to an all-time high ($19,850) as had several other major cryptocurrencies. Several warnings were given as to why people should avoid investing in cryptocurrencies on the premise of the volatile nature of the market.
Becca Kufrin's season of The Bachelorette continued on Monday night, and it was full of drama! There were fights over fake marriages, a Rachel Lindsay cameo, tears from the guys, throwbacks to Arie and a naked Jordan at the cocktail party -- what more could you want? We were LIVING for the petty moment when Lincoln, who won the first group date's relay race, refused to hide his portrait with Becca at the altar -- and SCREAMING when Connor took pettiness to a new level and broke the photo before throwing it into the pool.
Donald Trump hopes to bring his signature brand of glitz to the nation's capital with a new luxury hotel in the city's third-tallest building. During a Wednesday morning ceremony, Trump broke ground on a $200 million hotel that will transform the Old Post Office Building on Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and the Capitol. "We will produce one of the great hotels anywhere in the world," Trump said in his opening comments about the project. His daughter Ivanka, and sons Donald Jr. and Eric joined him for the groundbreaking. The new Trump International Hotel is expected to open in 2016.
Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi talks during an interview at her residence in Yangon in this May 25, 1996 file photo. NOBEL Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi is set to lose the freedom of Edinburgh over her failure to condemn the persecution of Rohingya Muslims by her country’s army. The 73-year-old leader of Myanmar – formerly Burma – was given the Capital’s highest honour in 2005 when she was still in opposition and under house arrest. She was hailed at the time as a beacon of democracy. But now Lord Provost Frank Ross is leading the bid to remove the title.
Mercedes Medical Inc. will break ground Thursday in Lakewood Ranch on a new headquarters and distribution center on the CORE biomedical research campus. CORE, the acronym for Collaboration Opportunities for Research and Exploration, is rising out of a 300-acre site dedicated to boosting the region’s life-sciences sector to supercharge the economy with high-paying jobs. Mercedes Medical, a women-owned and -operated medical supply company founded by Noelle Haft in 1991 in New York, has blossomed from a start-up into a success story with annual revenues in excess of $40 million and a customer list approaching 10,000.
TAMPA, Fla. — As the Yankees were going through tough negotiations with their longtime star Derek Jeter in 2010, team officials held a meeting with Jeter’s side. Jeter was 36 and his skills were declining, but he believed he deserved more than the three-year, $51 million deal he ultimately signed. During a heated exchange with Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman that was later detailed in a Sports Illustrated article, Jeter asked Cashman which shortstops he would rather have. One player Cashman listed: Troy Tulowitzki, who, nine years later, will indeed be patrolling shortstop for the Yankees on opening day.
Opening the door of his London home, Bill Oddie is just as millions know him from the TV — excitable, jokey, a little rumpled. Unexpectedly, though, despite having had a knee joint replacement only four weeks ago, he’s not on crutches or even using a walking stick. For at least six years since being diagnosed with osteoarthritis — where the cartilage breaks down causing the bones of the joint to rub together — Bill had lived with the pain all too familiar to many of the nine million Britons with the condition.
VIX: Index of fear, complacency or ignorance? Here we go again. More gumpf last week about the precipitous decline of the VIX and how the "Index of Fear" has gone down to seven-year, pre-crisis lows. Maybe if I say "Index of Fear" enough times I can convince myself, and anyone reading this column, that it is a big, scary concept that really is so terrifying we should all run for cover when it ticks up or that we are set for eternal peace when it continues lower.
I have gone back through the Steelers game against the New England Patriots now a few times and jotted down some more observations that I did not include in the post game recap. I do this every week as it is impossible to see everything just one or two times through a game. Many will judge off of a stat sheet and it is what sets this site apart from the rest as we actually watch the games more than just one time. The Patriots were so protective against the long ball early on that is opened up the middle of the field for Heath Miller and Ben Roethlisberger took it.
Mortgage rates remained fairly stagnant despite ongoing global growth concerns putting downward pressure on Treasury yields, the latest Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey said. “This marks the tenth consecutive week of a sub-4-percent mortgage rate,” said Sean Becketti, chief economist with Freddie Mac. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.85% for the week ending Oct. 1, down from last week when it averaged 3.86%. A year ago at this time, the 30-year FRM averaged 4.19%. Similarly, the 15-year FRM this week averaged 3.07%, falling from 3.08% last week.

PEP GUARDIOLA has put potential suitors on alert by admitting he will get bored at Bayern Munich. Guardiola took over from Jupp Heynckes in 2013 after a year's sabbatical. His contract is up in the same and he's been linked with a move to the Premier League. Manchester City, with former Barcelona men Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain, have a long-held interest while Roman Abrahimovic is a known fan. Sir Alex Ferguson also spoke with Guardiola when considering his successor at Manchester United. And the former Barcelona boss admits he doesn't seen himself at any club for longer than a few years.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi implored cable companies last week to support a privacy measure that would vastly restrict their business, and would, consequently, give Pelosi’s own big-time donors a critical edge online. Pelosi sought responses from businesses like Comcast, Verizon, Sprint and AT&T, to see if they support the repeal of pending Obama-era privacy regulations mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in October of 2016. Pelosi worried that undoing the new rules through the Congressional Review Act would allow internet service providers (ISPs) to package and sell people’s personal browsing data to advertisers.
A petition submitted to the British Parliament calls for the denial of all benefits to people convicted of crimes committed during the recent riots in the country. The call exceeded the 100,000 vote threshold needed to be reviewed by MPs. The petition submitted on August 10 through a governmental website had 118,821 votes at the time of writing. “No taxpayer should have to contribute to those who have destroyed property, stolen from their community and shown a disregard for the country that provides for them,” the petition says. Over the two days the site had difficulties registering all the votes as Britons rushed to back the petition.
IT'S hard to think of a "leisure" experience that assaults the senses more than the brutality of a trip to a pachinko parlour. Smoke? Check. Machine gun-like metal on metal? Yep. Flashing lights? Like a rave party. Well, maybe not quite like a rave, but they could certainly send one into a spasm. Visitors to Japan are often told, "Oh you'll have to take at least one trip to a pachinko parlour". In my experience, once is more than enough. The game itself is a form of pinball, but there are no flippers.
Awareness of the severity of concussions among young athletes has continued to spread among parents and schools within the last few years. Meanwhile, the athletic staff at Kennett Middle and High Schools in North Conway have seen a decline in concussions among their students. Neal Weaver is the athletic director for Kennett High School. Morning Edition Host Rick Ganley spoke with him by phone about the school’s efforts to reduce the number of concussions among athletes. So what are you and your staff actually doing differently than you would have a few years ago? Tell me about this technology that you’re using.
You’re not going to be able to conduct a Facebook Live from the skies as I did the next time you fly on a commercial airline. But through the latest tech from Gogo, you can stream from the plane. NEW YORK—How strong is the new Gogo in-air Wi-Fi? From the skies over Vermont, it was good enough to broadcast Facebook Live — and strong enough for watching YouTube. I conducted the Facebook Live session while flying 27,000 feet during a 90-minute test flight to nowhere, the purpose of which was to check out the latest Wi-Fi tech from Gogo, the largest provider of broadband in the skies.

The only thing missing is the star of the show. When she hears that performer Cassie Cassava (American Idol finalist Melinda Doolittle) is coming back home to sing in her church’s Easter service, Marlee contrives to steal the singer for her own program. She’s just trying to help her fellow “Crispers.” A big production needs a big star, right? But of course, nothing ever goes as planned. When disaster strikes, will Marlee’s big dreams disintegrate? Will she discover what will truly help others? What is Easter really all about?
CALTAGIRONE, Italy (Reuters) - Belgian Tim Wellens lived up to expectations on Tuesday when he won the Giro d’Italia fourth stage, a treacherous 202km ride from Catania with a steep finish, as Chris Froome struggled. After three opening days in Israel and a rest day, the Giro finally reached Italian soil, with Wellens tipped as a favorite to claim the day’s stage. The Lotto-Soudal rider was on the right end of a late split and he sustained his effort on an 800-meter climb up an average gradient of almost 10 percent to the finish line.
Year In Numbers: The Federal Reserve's $85 Billion Question As 2013 wraps up, NPR is looking at the numbers that tell this year's story. When it comes to the economy, $85 billion is a good candidate. That's the amount the Federal Reserve has been pumping into the financial system each month trying to stimulate growth and bring down unemployment. On Tuesday, Fed policymakers begin a two-day meeting at which they'll decide whether to dial back that stimulus. NPR presents the numbers that crystallize an idea or trend that was important in 2013.
Cramer says these are the six local banks to watch in the coming weeks. A Wall Street Journal article said Tuesday claimed that commercial real estate loans could generate losses of $100 billion. Jim Cramer, for one, thinks that may not be such a bad thing. With typical contrarian flare, Cramer ticked off six local banks on last night's "Mad Money" that are poised to buy up others when the housing sector bottoms out. All six stocks soared during morning trading, but settled in negative territory by midday. FirstMerit ( FMER was down 4 cents to $18.62.
The heirs of three workers who died after contracting an asbestos-induced illness have been awarded €45,000 in three separate lawsuits wherein the court declared that their right to life had been breached. Surviving relatives of the three men, two former Dockyard workers and a welder deployed by his private employer to carry out works at St Luke’s Hospital in Guardamangia, instituted proceedings against the Chief Government Medical Officer and the Attorney General. One of the men had taken up a job at the Drydocks in his youth and had worked there until his retirement in 1998.

PORTSMOUTH — Sunday's "Concert for Katherine" at The Music Hall may be in honor of Sam Jarvis' late wife, but those who will most benefit from the concert could be your mother, daughter, sister or friend. The Shaw Brothers, a famous singing and song writing duo, will headline the concert to raise money for the Katherine L. Jarvis Memorial Fund, in memory of the wife of Sam Jarvis, the longtime owner of The Metro restaurant. Katherine died in 1987 after a five-year battle with ovarian cancer and 28 years of marriage to Sam.
Amazon launched a barrage of Alexa-enabled devices a couple of months ago and the Echo Wall Clock was one of them. It has been just over a month since the company started shipping this product and it has now had to pull it from the proverbial shelves. The decision has been made due to connectivity issues with the device. Amazon’s Alexa-powered Echo devices can perform a wide variety of tasks, including but not limited to music streaming. They support a handful of popular streaming services from which users can listen to their favorite tracks by simply giving out voice commands.
Cistercian archbishop. Peter was born near Vienne, in Dauphine, France, and joined the Cistercian Order at Bonneveaux at the age of twenty with his two brothers and father. Known for his piety, at age thirty he was sent to serve as the first abbot of Tamie, in the Tarantaise Mountains, between Geneva and Savoy. There he built a hospice for travelers. In 1142, he was named the archbishop of Tarantaise against his wishes, and he devoted much energy to reforming the diocese, purging the clergy of corrupt and immoral members, aiding the poor, and promoting education.
Severe thunderstorms moved through North Texas early Wednesday morning, bringing hail, lightning, dangerously strong straight-line winds and at least two confirmed tornadoes. Shortly after 4 p.m., the NWS confirmed an EF-1, with wind gusts up to 83 mph, touched down in Lewisville. Swaths of tree, fence and roof damage were found in the area, the NWS said. Earlier in the afternoon, NWS survey crews said they found no evidence of a tornado in Rockwall, but did find evidence of straight-line winds up to 95 mph — the equivalent of an EF-1 tornado.
Cesare Giaccone lives at the end of a winding mountain road in Italy’s Albaretto della Torre. Tucked among steep but neatly manicured Barolo vineyards 15 miles from Alba, Albaretto della Torre is a hamlet so small that you could easily miss it if you look down for a second to double-check your map. Mr. Giaccone’s restaurant Da Cesare occupies the living room of a chalet-style house, the sort of place you drive by several times before it dawns on you that it could actually be a business. The restaurant has only 12 tables, and getting a reservation can require patience and a bit of luck.
It's very rare that I pick up a newspaper and read a sentence that leaves me shaking my head and muttering, "What in the heckfire did that mean?" But I would like GetReligion readers to join me in pondering one such case, which took place the other day in the Washington Post sports section, of all places. I read this on the MARC train, tore the clip out and then it got buried in my shoulder bag. It showed up this morning. This was an ordinary story last week about a game between the Baltimore Orioles and Satan's own team, the New York Yankees.
Debris on top of a motorcycles after an earthquake in Bali, Indonesia, Sunday, Aug. 5, 2018. The Indonesian island of Lombok was shaken by a third big earthquake in little more than a week Thursday as the official death toll from the most powerful of the quakes topped 300. Videos showed rubble strewn across streets and clouds of dust enveloping buildings. In northern Lombok, some people leaped from their vehicles on a traffic-jammed road while an elderly woman standing in the back of a pickup truck wailed "God is Great."
ChenOne Builders, an offshoot of the well-known apparel and home ware brand, launches ChenOne Luxury Apartments & Homes. With the dwindling number of residential plots and the subsequent increase in prices in the housing sector, there is a growing demand for apartments throughout Pakistan and an insufficient supply. ChenOne Builders – an offshoot of the well-known apparel and home ware brand – launched COLAH (ChenOne Luxury Apartments & Homes) Properties with the objective of filling this market gap. The development of the first initiative of COLAH Properties began in Faisalabad late last year, featuring fully-serviced luxury apartments on Canal Road.
Despite the global fall in business confidence, Mena (Middle East and North Africa) business leaders are optimistic having identified business opportunities for 2009, according to a report by international legal practice Norton Rose Group. The report, CEO Briefing 2009, is based on a survey of 925 CEOs and C-level executives worldwide conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit in November 2008 following the financial turmoil that unfolded in September 2008.
of $2,000bn (Dh7.34trn). Twenty-four per cent of respondents were from the Mena region. The results make comparisons with the last CEO Briefing study conducted in 2007.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accused Russia of sending attack helicopters to Syria. At a Washington think tank on Tuesday, Clinton said, "We are concerned about the latest information we have that there are attack helicopters on the way from Russia to Syria, which will escalate the conflict quite dramatically." Clinton said the United States has repeatedly asked Russia to stop arms shipments to President Bashar al-Assad's regime, but Russia has said anything it is sending is not being used against the public unrest. "That's patently untrue," Clinton said before making the accusation about the helicopter shipments.
Security tools often create a certain amount of anxiety. What happens if I lose my password? Or if my antivirus deletes my stuff? The advent of two-factor authentication has created a new twist on a familiar anxiety: what happens if I can't use my second factor and get locked out of my account? Jeremy from Capetown wrote in with a few concerns about 2FA. I've edited his letter for brevity. I am not too technical and want a two-factor authentication device that doesn't run into tricky complications when setting up or accessing like you encountered with the Yubikey.
Violinist Alex Eisenberg will be joining TOCCATA-Tahoe Symphony Orchestra for several performances in September. The Tahoe Symphony Orchestra's 13th SummerFest will conclude with a commemoration of the 17th anniversary of the 9/11 tragedy. The concert will open with Alex Eisenberg's virtuosic performance of the Bruch "Violin Concerto No. 1."

The opening will be followed by Verdi's "Requiem," presented by a 66-voice chorus, large orchestra, and soloists.
A historic impeachment trial of the Philippines' top judge will begin on Monday as President Benigno Aquino steps up his popular but sometimes controversial crusade to stamp out corruption. Members of the 23-person Senate will sit as judges to determine whether Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona should be removed from his post and become the highest-profile scalp yet in Aquino's relentless anti-graft drive. "We are going through a process to stop a rogue magistrate from completely crushing the sacred institution of the Supreme Court," Aquino said in the lead-up to the trial, which could take months.
China Seeing Dawn of a Labor Movement? This story was filed by CBS News correspondent Celia Hatton in Beijing. Striking autoworkers in southern China demanding better pay and job benefits? Just a few weeks ago, that's not something you would have seen in the media headlines here. Since foreign companies began flooding into China in the 1980s, low-wage laborers have formed the backbone of the country's flourishing economy. Few other countries could offer an almost endless supply of relatively well-educated, healthy young laborers who would toil for long shifts without complaint.
More than 80 people, mostly children, were kidnapped from a school in the city of Bamenda in western Cameroon early on Monday, government and military sources said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the abduction in the English-speaking region where separatists are fighting to form a breakaway state. The separatists have imposed curfews and closed down schools as part of their protest against President Paul Biya's French-speaking government. "In total 81 people were kidnapped including the principal. They were taken to the bush," a military source told Reuters. A government spokesman said it was keeping track of an event but that it could not comment further.
Prayerful Protest: A member of Women of the Wall prays at the Kotel. The feminist prayer group Women of the Wall filed a petition with the Israeli High Court today to demand protection during its prayer services at the Western Wall holy site, the group said. Their petition was filed against the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, which administers the site, and its head, Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitz. The petition also named the Israeli police. Women of the Wall said it filed the petition for protection against what it described as a significant uptick in disturbances during its first-of-the-month prayer services at the Western Wall.
Bipolar and narcissism: Is there a link? Is there a link between bipolar and narcissism? Bipolar disorders are mood disorders that cause extreme high and low moods. During a manic episode, symptoms of bipolar might be confused with narcissistic traits, such as a heightened sense of importance or lack of empathy. Narcissism is not a symptom of bipolar, and most people with bipolar are not narcissistic. However, some people with bipolar may display narcissistic traits as a result of their other symptoms. In this article, we take a look at the relationship between bipolar disorder and narcissism, including symptoms and treatment.
The seminarians come from the Diocese of Faenza-Modigliana, headed by Bishop Mario Toso, who served under Benedict as secretary of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. VATICAN CITY — Several enthusiastic seminarians met with Benedict XVI at the Vatican Gardens on Tuesday — even though it is their exam time, they did not want to miss the chance to meet the pope emeritus. The seminarian has an ontology exam on June 18. The seminarians come from the Italian Diocese of Faenza-Modigliana, headed by Bishop Mario Toso. The diocese has 12 seminarians.
Coming from a troubled background in Canton, he said there was no reason he should have ended up in Lancaster or had this job. He was living a life of drugs and alcohol — even living out of his truck — until everything changed on Nov. 20, 1980 in a Perkins Restaurant & Bakery parking lot in Canton. Now Salvatori is retiring as the second longest executive director in the mission’s 100 plus years of existence. The mission is a non-denominational religious center that provides services to community members in need through its thrift store, food pantry, day care and medical clinic.
The Apple event on September 12 not only unveiled the iPhone 5 but also revealed the new iPod touch fifth generation. Although the iPhone 5 released later that month there were no details given for a precise release for the new iPod touch lineup. However it seems that a slip on an Australian website could have revealed that the launch will take place in three weeks time. At the time the new iPod touch was revealed Apple only gave a release timeframe of sometime in October and indeed if you check out the US Apple store online right now you’ll just see ‘October’ listed as a shipping date.
The cast of the 90s TV show, Hip Hip Hurray, just had a reunion of sorts and the pictures that surfaced on the Instagram indicate that they had a blast. The show provided some memorable for most. The actors, like Purab Kohli, Rushad Rana, Sharukh Barucha and Vishal Malhotra became household names and gained instant popularity. Actor Rushad Rana shared two pictures from the reunion, in which one can see actors Sharukh Barucha, Vishal Malhotra and Mehul Nisar raising a toast. He captioned the picture post as: Nostalgia#at its best.
According to federal regulations, there is currently no opportunity to send any additional water south. As Hurricane Irma brought significant, widespread flooding and damage to the peninsula of Florida, it also brought nearly three feet of water to Lake Okeechobee. As is typical during high periods of rainfall, all of this excess water – combined with the double-digit rainfall totals in June – overwhelmed our man-made flood control system and necessitated massive releases to the coastal estuaries from Lake Okeechobee. According to federal regulations, there is currently no opportunity to send any additional water south.
I’d like to applaud Marv Wirth for doing the research and writing the letter “We have room for but one language here — English” in Sunday’s Tribune. I applaud the Tribune for printing this letter. He’s on the money, he’s got his facts straight. It’s a very good letter, very well-written. Rep. Dave Schultheis not only offended the Bustillos family, he offended all Latinos as well. I was reading the Oct. 7 story about the legislator questioning citizenship of the Bustillos family. It is terrible. The family is grieving.
A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Daily Star on May 22, 2017, on page 2. SPY ARRESTED General Security Saturday announced the arrest of an Iraqi national believed to be working with Israeli intelligence services inside Lebanon to create a surveillance network. General Security arrested the man, identified as M.Y., on suspicion of communicating with and gathering information for Israel. During interrogation, M.Y. said he was recruited by an officer from an Israeli group affiliated with the country's Defense Ministry that actively conducts operations in Arab countries. M.Y.
How many times have we heard all these ‘predictions’ of inevitable and imminent European doom, disintegration an destruction now? And how long will we still hear them? While the EU and the euro endure and a dozen or so countries are eagerly waiting to also come suffer terribly in this house of horror called the European Union? Isn’t it obvious what is behind this sort of stories? Wishful thinking of the malicious kind from those who would call the EU a ‘foe’, because it stands in the way of their malicious ambitions.
Sean Dyche has backed his players to bounce back at Bournemouth tomorrow. The Clarets suffered only their third defeat of the season, in controversial circumstances, on Sunday, as Arsenal snatched a 1-0 win in injury time. Alexis Sanchez scored from the spot after James Tarkowski was adjudged to have shoved Aaron Ramsey in the box. It was the third-successive time the Gunners have beaten Burnley with a contentious late goal, but Dyche doesn’t dwell on disappointments, and he said: All I know is that we are continuing to improve I feel, and there were good signs of that again.
The Human Library at UC Davis is designed to create a positive platform where people of different backgrounds can come together to ask questions, share stories about diverse life experiences, and have one-on-one conversations that challenge stereotypes, prejudices and preconceived ideas. Modeled after an international movement for social change called the Human Library, the Human Library at UC Davis is an event where people are the “Books” and they offer their stories to “Readers” through 20-minute conversations. It is a forum where interesting, thought-provoking and difficult questions are expected, appreciated and discussed. Check back soon!
There is a lot of speculation around the March 2019 core update that started on March 12th that it reversed what the Medic update did on August 1, 2018. While many sites did see gains after dropping from the August 1st update, many did not. We've seen examples before with video thumbnails in the Google search results snippets. But it feels like Google is showing video thumbnails more often now, like they are with image thumbnails more often. Last May we reported Google is testing asking searchers for answers to questions they might not have search results for.
President Obama's Labor Secretary Hilda Solis is supposed to represent American workers. What you need to know is that this longtime open-borders sympathizer has always had a rather radical definition of "American." At a Latino voter registration project conference in Los Angeles many years ago, Solis asserted to thunderous applause, "We are all Americans, whether you are legalized or not." That's right. The woman in charge of enforcing our employment laws doesn't give a hoot about our immigration laws — or about the fundamental distinction between those who followed the rules in pursuit of the American dream and those who didn't.
Fishermen of oysters from Essex are waiting to hear if a prized oyster variety is to be given special status. The Colchester Native oyster is only found in creeks around the River Colne. Local fishermen want the European Union to protect their delicacy from traders passing off inferior oysters under the same name. If successful the oyster will be one of only 34 UK specialities on the list, joining Jersey Royals and Newcastle Brown Ale. About 70 tonnes of the Colchester Native oyster are produced each year compared to 1,000 tonnes of the more common rock oyster.
Railroad company CSX Corporation (NASDAQ: CSX) beat the Street when it reported frist-quarter earnings Tuesday, but sell-side analysts have mixed opinions on its long-term outlook. CSX reported first-quarter earnings per share of $1.02, up 30 percent year-over-year and more than a dime above Wall Street expectations of 91 cents. The company’s performance was aided by some extraordinary items, including a lower tax rate, but even so, it still came in stronger than expected on earnings. CSX did post a slight revenue miss, however. The earnings improvement was driven mostly by cost efficiencies.
NEW YORK — Julia Roberts is sitting on a couch in a Soho hotel when Lucas Hedges bursts in and begins frantically searching for his phone, sending pillows flying. It can take a lot to get Roberts away from home. Hedges at one point jokingly suggested shooting “Ben Is Back” in her backyard. She’s notoriously picky, generally acting in one film a year, and that’s become iffier considering, as she says, there’s “a whole lot of math” that needs to factor her kids’ school schedule and that of her husband, cinematographer Danny Moder.
She married Michael Middleton in New Hampshire in 2013 after meeting him on the internet. He was the kind of guy who “makes you feel special,” as she told WMTW TV from her home in Exeter. There was the Z28 Camaro, all the new clothes, the gadgets. “He’d say, ‘Babe, I really like this computer! Can we get this computer?’” Grant recounted in another interview with Newsweek. “So I bought a computer” — only to discover later that Middleton had returned multiple gifts so he could pocket the cash.
Acer offered a preview of its upcoming Stream smartphone at a press conference in Beijing on Thursday. The Stream has a unique screen layout, using its status bar as a divider between application icons at the bottom of the screen and application history at the top. Applications like Facebook, the Twidroid Twitter client, Spinlets, and Nemo player will come preinstalled on the phone. Running Google's Android 2.1 operating system, the Stream has a 1GHz Snapdragon processor from Qualcomm, 512MB of RAM, 2GB of internal Flash memory, and comes bundled with an 8GB memory card.
NBC Is making a live-action, Peter Pan-inspired workplace comedy titled Wendy and Peter. It sounds like The Office meets J.M. Barrie's classic fairy tale. I volunteer the whole of Brooklyn as both a cast and location (including myself). According to Deadline, the half-hour, single camera show will be more of a romantic comedy and less of a drama about a young person who kidnaps a family of children in the middle of the night. And it's set in a workplace, because if there's anything the classic story of Peter Pan needs more of, it's computer screens.
John and Rudnick is an exciting combo team for this musical. John is writing the music; Rudnick is writing the book and lyrics. Rudnick’s Broadway credits include I Hate Hamlet and The New Century, and he’s written such films as Sister Act, Addams Family Values, and the hilarious Kevin Kline comedy In & Out. A timeline wasn’t announced for the musical, but Tony Award-winning producer Kevin McCollum, who worked on Hand to God, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s In the Heights and Rent, began developing The Devil Wears Prada musical over a year and a half ago.
Most economists on Wall Street and at the Federal Reserve think the economy is going to be much improved this year. But this view may be just another case of wishful thinking, said Stephen Roach, one of the most prominent market economists who is now at Yale University. “My advice is to keep the champagne on ice,” Roach, the former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia wrote in an op-ed entitled “America’s False Dawn” posted on Project Syndicate. Roach argues that American consumers are still grappling with high debt burdens.
I’m excited to take on the new challenge and role as News Director at DC’s premier news station. I’ve worn numerous hats since arriving at WTOP in 2004, first as a news reporter, Executive Producer and then Assignments Manager. I’m proud to say I’m a two-time winner of the National Edward R. Murrow Award and a winner of the Gracie Award for compelling documentaries and series which explored the long recovery for wounded warriors, invisible wounds warriors endure along with TBD’s and PTSD.
The 107th Attack Wing is one of the original units of the New York Air National Guard, having been allocated to the state of New York on May 24, 1946, shortly after the end of World War II. It was then on Dec. 8, 1948, that the 107th was given federal recognition and commenced flying operations with an initial strength of 100 Airmen assigned. Over the following 70 years, the 107th distinguished itself at home and in combat, and set many milestones and records along the way. However, the story of the 107th does not simply start in 1948.
Windows 10's Delivery Optimization feature turns your computer into an update-sharing hub. Here's how to turn that off. One of Windows 10's new features is its optimized update delivery system. If Microsoft's servers are busy, Windows 10 can grab updates for the operating system and for Windows Store apps from other computers -- either on your local network or over the Internet. On one hand, this "Delivery Optimization" feature can be useful if you have a shaky Internet connection and need an update right away, or if Microsoft's servers are bogged down.
CHICAGO – It was late January when Nancy Swabb found herself wanting to help a family across the Atlantic Ocean, in Cote d'Ivoire -- all because of a photo. A friend had shared a post on Facebook about the need for a host family for a 9-month-old girl for two months while she received medical care in Park Ridge, Illinois. The post came from Children's Medical Missions West, a nonprofit that helps transport children around the world to receive free medical care for rare conditions and issues. Swabb saw a photo of baby Dominique on her mother's lap.
Jake Smith has worked for a variety of technology-focused publications over the years, covering Apple's smartphone rise as an editor at 9to5mac and the explosion of the consumer tech obsession for Pocket-lint as US News Editor. Jake currently attends the University of Kentucky, studying finance, and thinks drones will be the next big thing. Apple is planning a new corporate campus for the United States, and a new report says it's set for North Carolina. It's a limited initial rollout, but a start. Google says Android Auto wireless support should come to more phones and car displays soon.
When Ravens coach John Harbaugh declared Gus Edwards the team’s No. 1 running back this offseason, he was technically talking about a player who wasn’t under contract. That matter has been resolved. Edwards signed his free agent tender with the Ravens today, a league source tells PFT. Technically, Edwards was an exclusive-rights free agent, which means he couldn’t sign with any other team. For exclusive-rights free agents, signing is basically a formality, as they would have no leverage if they tried to get a better deal than the tender offer.
432 Fairfield Ave.: Another CubeSmart self storage facility is coming to the city, this one in the Waterside neighborhood. The self-storage company, with hundreds of locations across the U.S. and several in Connecticut including two in Norwalk and one in Wilton, is building a 30,000-square-foot facility on Fairfield Avenue. An Arizona-based limited liability company, Fairfield Avenue Storage, bought the 1.14-acre lot early last year for $2.9 million before building began, according to city and state records.

Linoleum contains linseed oil which weakens standard adhesives. 1 Do You Need to Remove Linoleum Before Laying Tile? 2 Will Thinset Adhere to a Vinyl Floor? 4 What Kind of Floor Can You Lay Over Linoleum? Linoleum flooring is similar to vinyl but constructed from natural components. This poses a challenge when installing tiles directly over top of it. The linseed oil in the linoleum can cause breakdown of the adhesive that holds the tiles to the floor. Installation over concrete slabs only requires sanding the surface with 60-grit sandpaper to roughen it.
CMA Fest 2018: What will the weather be in Nashville? What's the CMA Fest weather forecast? The CMA Music Festival returns June 7-10 and visitors to Nashville will want to pack sunscreen and ponchos for the four-day festival. The CMA Music Festival returns June 7-10, and while Nashville awoke to a perfect summer morning today, as the week progresses, humidity, heat and the possibility of storms will come limping back like a festival attendee breaking in cowboy boots on Lower Broadway. There is a 30 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms Saturday night.
Much has been written about how and why marketers need to focus their efforts on younger generations. The ways millennials consume information and interact with brands is having a large influence on older generations too. Throughout recent history, new media habits generally start with the young and migrate to everyone else over time. In 2016, no self-respecting senior citizen will be without an iPhone or Facebook account so all marketers need to be thinking mobile first for their marketing outreach. Mobile first is a change in mindset from the past. Traditional sports’ marketing was rooted in one-way interruptive advertising and old fashion brand building.
In 2014, the major trends in the Russian oil and gas sector were primarily influenced by sanctions imposed by foreign governments earlier in the year. In particular, the sanctions limited access of domestic companies to goods and services necessary for deep water oil exploration and production, Arctic oil exploration or production and shale oil projects in Russia. This development has had a devastating effect on a number of Russian shelf projects. Prior to this, domestic and international majors negotiated several ambitious joint ventures and the Russian government made substantial efforts to bring the Russian legal framework closer to existing international practice.
Dreamworks has announced that Aaron Paul has signed an agrement to star in the upcoming Need For Speed feature film, scheduled to hit theaters on February 7, 2014. As for what that actually entails, the announcement goes on to claim that the film will be “in the tradition of the great car culture films of the ’70s while being extremely faithful to the spirit of the video game franchise.” That’s a bit vague, but it seems safe to assume that this particular car culture film will skew more toward the Fast And The Furious franchise than toward Drive.
Lufthansa is making baggage check-in even simpler. From now on, at Munich airport passengers can check their bags in themselves. New baggage drop-off machines with easy-to-follow instructions guide passengers through the few steps needed to check in their bags. Six new-generation baggage machines are already in operation at the southern end of Terminal 2, and a further 13 will be added at Munich by the end of November 2012. At Frankfurt, two baggage drop-off machines are also undergoing a test run. By the middle of next year, a total of 16 will be in routine operation at Germany’s largest airport.
The longtime couple sparked marriage rumours after a photo of them seemingly cutting a wedding cake was shared on Instagram, Fox News reports. Cyrus' pal Conrad Carr shared a photo of the couple on his Instagram story that set off the rumour mill. In the image, the pop star is wearing an off-the-shoulder ivory gown while her Australian fiance, Hemsworth, is wearing a black suit and holding a knife with Cyrus' hand on top of his. Standing before them is a two-tier ivory cake with flower details as well as Cyrus' mum, Tish, who is dressed down in a black shirt and jeans.
Beginning on Tuesday, readers of nytimes.com who click on a staff byline (we're only doing this with staff names, which appear underlined and in color), will, in addition to seeing other articles by that writer, be able to e-mail the reporter. That reader e-mail will be routed without disclosing the address of the reporter, thus keeping regular e-mail boxes free of additional junk mail.

It simply means that readers should be heard and, whenever possible, engaged.
There are no indications missing teenager Scott Redman is still alive, according to South Australian police investigating his disappearance following a high-speed chase earlier this year. Police have now declared Mr Redman's disappearance a major crime and have launched a fresh search for the 19-year-old, who has not been seen since April. Investigators are focusing their search efforts on a 12-square-kilometre area west of Kimba on Eyre Peninsula. Police believe Mr Redman and an associate travelled to the area after abandoning an SUV which was involved in a brief police chase. The black Kia Sorento was being pursued on the Eyre Highway near Kimba about 3:50pm on Saturday, April 21.
Influenza activity is ramping up, including the number of flu-related deaths statewide and the number of vaccinations given locally. Six flu-related deaths were reported in North Carolina during the week ending on Feb. 2, bringing the total number this season to 35, according to the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services. The figure does not represent all flu-associated deaths in the state since many go undiagnosed or unreported, NCDHHS stated in a news release. No flu deaths have been reported in Henderson County so far this season, according to Crystal O’Dell, director of nursing at the Department of Public Health.
CBP removed an employee for a positive drug test, but he claimed he must have unwittingly eaten a laced brownie beforehand. New legislation would protect the jobs of federal employees who legally use marijuana under state law. New legislation would protect the jobs of federal employees who use marijuana in states where it is legal. The Justice Department announced it is reversing an Obama-era policy on marijuana that had allowed the decision to regulate the drug to be left to the states. A survey shows the percentage of federal employees who approve of marijuana legalization is slightly less than that of the general public.
Only 40 percent of the 6.8 million total BlackBerrys sold in the period run on the next-gen platform. That's a number that most on Wall Street regard as disappointing. BlackBerry sold a humbling 2.7 million BlackBerry 10 devices in its fiscal first quarter. The company disclosed on a conference call Friday that 40 percent of the 6.8 million total BlackBerrys it sold in the period, which ended June 1, ran on its much-ballyhooed next-generation platform. That's a number that most on Wall Street regarded as disappointing. Sanford Bernstein analyst Pierre Ferragu, for instance, had expected sales of 3 million units.
Octavia Rogers, 29, a mother of three, is facing the death penalty as she begins trial in Maricopa County, Arizona, on Feb. 9. Rogers is accused of the stabbing death of her three sons and the dismemberment of their bodies. On Jan. 31, Jeannette Gallagher, a prosecutor in the case, argued that Rogers deserves the death penalty because her crimes were committed in "an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner," notes The Arizona Republic. Gallagher added the "needless mitigation" and "gratuitous manner" of Rogers&apos; crimes, notwithstanding her "special relationship" to the boys.
Smart thermostat Nest is about to get a lot more secure. The company just added an important security feature that you should enable if you care about keeping your IoT-enabled home safe: two-factor authentication. The feature works just like it does anywhere else — you've likely seen it on services such as Gmail or PayPal. It adds an additional layer of security on top of your password by requesting a verification code at login. Since this code is sent to your phone when needed, it means an unauthorized user can't log in even if he has the password.
The crash on the Sprain Brook Parkway that's blocking traffic during the Wednesday evening commute is a fatal. One person died in a three-car crash on the Sprain Brook Parkway just before the Wednesday evening commute. The accident happened after 4 p.m. near Grasslands Road. Stop-and-go traffic was backed up in both directions from the Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla to Greenburgh for hours during Wednesday evening's commute. At 8 p.m., all lanes were reopened, state police said. Police didn't release any other information about the crash, and the victim's name won't be released until next of kin is notified.
The traditionally dour cinematic universe is given a much-needed jolt of energy in a light-hearted yet overly long mash-up of Big and Superman. If there’s one thing that DC’s cinematic universe needs its better lighting. Or wait, on reflection, maybe it’s smarter scripts. Or hang on, perhaps it’s more coherent action scenes. Or actually, you know what; it’s the removal of Zack Snyder from every conceivable creative and technical level. Oh yeah, so it was just the one thing, right, well in that case it would be a drastically lighter tone.
In yesterday's highly anticipated matchup between top-ranked River Hill and No. 5 Old Mill, neither team flinched or showed any weaknesses as they traded leads early in the night. The Patriots, however, showed the type of resilience that will make them one of the Class 4A-3A teams to beat by winning five of the last six matches for a 31-24 victory. Old Mill improved to 13-1 and is developing into the type of team that could challenge for its 11th overall state title. "It was a great match that went back and forth," said Old Mill coach Dan Youngblood.
In the wake of Russia's increasingly belligerent behavior in Ukraine, President Barack Obama delivered a ringing declaration of NATO's support for the Baltic countries Wednesday in the capital of Estonia, a former Soviet Republic and current NATO member that also has reason to fear Russian aggression. Mr. Obama vowed the U.S. and NATO would honor the alliance's pledge of collective defense and back it up with a beefed-up troop presence and air patrols. He also pointed to NATO's decision to create a rapid reaction force and pre-positioning of military equipment in the region as evidence of the alliance's resolve to defend its members.
Trump wants to privatize air traffic control. Here’s what that means. Change could soon be coming to the skies above America. At least that’s what the Trump administration is hoping for. Earlier Monday, President Trump laid out his vision for overhauling the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) — the agency that oversees all aspects of civil aviation. Part of Trump’s vision involves privatizing the agency’s air traffic control (ATC) function. Here’s what you should know about it. How does air traffic control currently work?
Warren Buffett's $1.2 billion share buyback from a single unnamed investor likely helped that person's estate save substantially on taxes, just one day after the Berkshire Hathaway CEO said the rich should actually be paying more, not less, when they die. With the fiscal cliff looming and estate taxes set to rise dramatically in less than three weeks, the timing was seen as advantageous — and, according to Berkshire watchers, also out of place in the context of Buffett's recent tax activism. "I would say 'Warren, would you please just keep your nose out of this.'
Fifty workers in Saudi Arabia have gone on strike alleging that they have not been paid their wages for seven months, local media reported. The workers are reportedly all Asian nationals working as technicians based in Jeddah. They have visited the Ministry of Labour twice to lodge complaints against their employer but the parties have yet to reach an agreement, according to Saudi Gazette. The newspaper claimed to have seen documents relating to the case and showing that the workers have not been paid their salaries since April. It is alleged that the company is in financial difficulties and has previously delayed wage payments by up to three months at a time.
LOS ANGELES – Christmas is approaching and Los Angeles is starting to think about championships, with the resurgent Rams and Chargers dreaming of playoff glory and even the NBA’s Lakers and Clippers surging impressively. And, in a warm and tasteful condo in the Pico-Robertson neighborhood, Super Bowl aspirations also are bubbling in the mind of America’s most adorable, and quite possibly its greatest, national anthem singer. Not much chance of that. Forgive the clumsy sports analogy, but despite her tender years Malea is a big game player who thrives in the company of superstars.
Why Were the Police Held Back in Charlottesville? Charlottesville is now a by-word for political violence. As you’ve probably heard, the Virginia college town played host to an alt-right rally that descended into violence on Saturday. Both the white nationalists and left-wing counter-protesters fought and beat each other with blunt objects for most of the morning. The sheer violence and extremism on display in Charlottesville shocked the nation, and politicians all over the spectrum issued strong condemnations of the rally. Foremost among them were Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Democratic Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer.

Netanyahu will likely find Liberman and Kahlon more accommodating than in the past – and his other coalition partners committed to keeping his right-wing government in power. As Benny Gantz declared victory on Tuesday night, exit polls revealed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won a best-of-all-possible-worlds victory. Right-wing parties will command a Knesset majority, while the right-wing parties with pretensions of supplanting Likud as the flagship of the right-wing bloc (i.e. New Right and Zehut) failed to cross the electoral threshold as of press time. This enables Netanyahu to build a coalition with Orthodox and other sectoral parties without a stake in the prime minister’s political demise.
On the morning of Feb. 8, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers showed up across the street from Rising Hope Mission Church on Russell Road in the Mount Vernon area of Alexandria. According to several witnesses, men who had just left the church’s hypothermia shelter for the day were set upon and questioned. Some were asked if they’d seen any number of illegal immigrant criminals for which the officers were searching. Others, Latinos in the group, were singled out, fingerprinted, and some even restrained, forced into vans and driven away, witnesses said.
Chicago Public School officials say they will be overhauling the district's special education program to eradicate problems that may make it difficult for the city's children with disabilities to get the right services, according to the Chicago Tribune. "A special need should not prevent a child from learning," district spokeswoman Monique Bond, told the paper. "This is an area where time is of the essence because these are students and children whose needs are at risk when we don't address their issues in a timely manner. We're very cognizant of that."
Former foreign minister Julie Bishop has opened up about her leadership ambitions, and claims Christopher Pyne was the reason she failed. Ms Bishop said she believed she had the support of at least 28 colleagues - more than Scott Morrison - before going into the party room last August, only to be knocked out in the first round of voting. "I am now told that there was a view, led by Christopher Pyne and others, that even though I would have 28 votes -- which was many more than Scott Morrison -- it wouldn't be enough to beat Peter Dutton.
More than 200 state workers, including 90 judges and 42 administrators, will forgo a pay hike next year under a bill proposed by Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle. The Honolulu Star Bulletin reports the bill is aimed at resolving the state's looming 1.1 billion US dollar budget shortfall. The proposed suspension of pay hikes will save the state 4.1 million dollars over two years. Governor Lingle says she's also asking state employee unions to forgo proposing pay increases in the upcoming collective bargaining negotiations. This is why she says it's important for state leaders to make sacrifices and lead by example.
Mother’s Day means it’s time to get your brunch on whilst celebrating the lovely lady who gave you life. Brunch wouldn’t be brunch without a little something sweet — like one of these delicious (and very brunch-friendly) dessert options Mom is bound to love. Right out the gate, Pavlova is sure to satisfy even the sweetest of sweet tooths. I call Pavlova a big marshmallow because it’s light, shiny and gorgeous, just like the Russian ballerina it was named for. It’s a stunning end to dinner parties; use any berry or fruit to make your compote.
you can bet on it! Pete Rose may have finished his career with a whopping 4,256 hits — enough for first place all-time in baseball history — but is still not enshrined in Cooperstown. Rose after all famously bet on baseball while serving as both a player and a manager, and has been an asterisk at best in the history of the game, despite the on-field prowess he showed for years as a member of the Cincinnati Reds. Controversy has always swirled around the complicated legacy of Pete Rose, better known in many circles by the endearing moniker “Charlie Hustle”.

Senior living: Is concierge care for you? Seven years ago my client told me how pleased she was with the concierge medical practice she and her spouse had joined. She had called her doctor a few days before with a medical need. The nurse answered immediately, and because it was an urgent issue, she was seen that day. The doctor spent 30 minutes with her and called the next day with test results that indicated a need for a specialist referral. The doctor’s staff made the appointment and sent the specialist her records.

Even as countries continue to ratify and implement the international treaty prohibiting the use of cluster munitions, casualties from these notorious weapons doubled in the past year, with civilians accounting for nearly all the victims, according to a United Nations-backed civil society report. The annual monitoring report released on 31 August at the UN Office at Geneva by the Cluster Munition Coalition revealed that the use of cluster munitions in war-torn Syria and Yemen has caused a lot of civilian casualties. Moreover, in those two countries, conflict and insecurity are hampering clearance of the deadly weapons.
A dragon is a good thing to have. Everyone knows dragons have magical powers. They are wise, although sometimes also vain. Dragons can be fierce protectors, too. The magic of the content marketing dragon is lead generation, lead nurturing, and SEO (especially if your dragon has a long tail.) But if you’re going to own a dragon, you have to feed it. Otherwise, no more fire. No more magic. This is the chief content officer. This person keeps the dragon in line.

GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK — The search in Grand Canyon National Park for LouAnn Merrell and her 14-year-old stepgrandson is being scaled back, a park spokeswoman said Thursday. PHOENIX - The desperate effort this week to find two hikers who disappeared at the bottom of the Grand Canyon represented the National Park Service’s most extensive use yet of drones in a search-and-rescue mission. The Grand Canyon is the only national park with its own fleet of unmanned aircraft for reaching people who have gotten lost, stranded, injured or killed. Under a program that began last fall, it has five drones and four certified operators.
"You don't simply say 'I'm sorry' to a man you've robbed. . . . You return what you stole or your apology takes on a hollow ring." History cannot be undone; anything we do now must inevitably be an expression of regret and an affirmation of our better values as a nation, not an accounting which balances or erases. . . . That is now beyond anyone's power. The politics of race with respect to African American reparations might begin with an analysis of one root of the continuing problem of race in America - that found within the White American community.
ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu. ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu has made a shocking proposal: the party’s top leaders should step down for having failed members as it moves from one crisis to the next. Currently the ANC is divided over the pending prosecution of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan whose fraud case is set down on November 2nd. Two highly placed sources said the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) had assured Berning Ntlemeza, head of priority crimes unit the Hawks, that it would not back down on the decision to charge Gordhan.
Slights with a smile. Silence when you know they can hear you. Compliments with a side of side-eye. Passive aggressive people know how to serve up a veritable buffet of “Oh no she didn’t.” And tacking on “LOL” afterwards doesn’t negate things. However it manifests, passive aggression is the fine art of being angry without seeming angry. There are two ingredients: anger and avoidance. The first, anger—or its cousins annoyance, frustration, or irritation—always bubbles beneath the surface. But trying to suppress anger is like trying to keep a lid on a pot of boiling water.
The method of distribution amongst file sharing sites is continuously evolving. Although BitTorrent once epitomized file sharing, alternative approaches have quickly pushed their way to prominence, with cyberlockers Hotfile and Megaupload gaining rapid popularity. Unsurprisingly, the Pirate Bay seems to be moving with the times, as it is backing the recently launched Tube+. Tube+ is quite different than what Internet users have been accustomed to when it comes to media distribution. It is not just a cyberlocker, BitTorrent or media streaming site – rather, it can best be defined as a hybrid of the three models.
Both Florida State and Cincinnati got raw deals by the NCAA tournament selection committee, and Seton Hall and Syracuse should've swapped seeds. The NCAA tournament selection committee doesn't have an easy job. But considering the euphoria of playing in March Madness and how critical matchups are for advancing to the second weekend, well, the cast of decision-makers isn't getting off the hook that easy. Cincinnati, the AAC tourney winner, should've been a No. 5 or No. 6 seed. The committee gave the Bearcats (28-6) a No. 7 seed in the South Region.

The Wildcats are 3-6 this season after winning one game in 2017. Chad Ward is in his first season as the Wildcats' head coach. Cincinnati Enquirer readers voted Williamsburg High School football as the Ohio Team of the Week, based on votes tallied Oct. 19. Our football teams of the week receive a feature that runs the following week. Before Williamsburg High School could build its football program in the Chad Ward era, first, it needed to build its roster. In 2017, the Wildcats went 1-9. Then, Ward was the offensive coordinator.

Hidden-camera footage taken inside a Florida nursing home shows many children with special needs sitting in hallways with no activities or toys. The home’s calendar calls this activity "chillin’." FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — At Kidz Korner, children in wheelchairs sit parked in a hallway. It’s a nursing home, but looks more like a storage facility for kids. And it’s been Andrew’s home for more than a year. Andrew was an outgoing high school senior. His goal was to become a firefighter, but a freak incident changed his life.
3 Mar 2017 - This year’s conference topic will be Migration: Crossing the Line, which will focus on the global movement of people. This issue currently holds the international spotlight as migration has and will continue to impact countries around the globe through a variety of forms. The 2017 UNIS-UN international student conference will examine varying perspectives on the issues surrounding migration: the causes, individual experiences as well as the political and humanitarian responses to migration. As millions of people flee their countries to escape armed conflict, political turmoil and economic hardships, we will consider who is responsible for providing aid and to what extent.
Tech giants, like Amazon, Expedia, Google, and Microsoft, have thrown their considerable weight behind Washington state and Minnesota in a lawsuit challenging President Trump’s executive immigration order. But smaller players have just as much to lose under anti-immigration policies — and now some of them are stepping into the ring. Fifteen startups have added their names to an amicus brief, signed by more than 100 technology companies and other businesses. The original brief backs the states’ case, detailing how the executive order negatively impacts employees and business operations.
Cy the Cynic says that a clean shirt attracts the soup of the day. Cy is a typical pessimist: seldom disappointed. As today�s declarer, Cy took the ace of clubs and led a trump to his ace. West showed out, so East had two trump tricks. The Cynic glowered and led the king of hearts, and West won and led a second club to dummy. Cy next led a diamond to his jack, but West produced the queen. Cy was able to avoid losing another diamond but still went down one.
George Soros, the billionaire investor, believes the banking sector is a “parasite” holding back the economic recovery and an “incestuous” relationship with regulators means little has been done to resolve the issues behind the 2008 crisis. “The banking sector is acting as a parasite on the real economy,” Mr Soros said in his new book “The Tragedy of the European Union”. Mr Soros outlined how the problems that caused the Eurozone economic crisis remain largely unresolved. “Very little has been done to correct the excess leverage in the European banking system.
Hailed by the Association of British Toy Retailers as one of the most successful girls' toys ever, My Little Pony dolls first went on sale in 1983. In 1990, the brand's popularity peaked and, in the following year, competition from rival toys entering the market led to the decision by toymaker Hasbro to stop manufacturing the ponies. But to celebrate My Little Pony's 20th anniversary last year, Hasbro decided to relaunch the toys and hired PR agency Mason Williams to raise awareness about its new product range among nostalgic mothers, young children and collectors. To drive sales.
Ugh! Me so stupid! All I had to do was come up with some good ideas for Gizmodo’s Senior Week, and I went and fucked the whole thing up. The task was pretty simple: We were supposed to pitch the stories “we’ve always wanted to write” and spend the whole week “doing whatever the hell we want,” but when you’re this dumb—doing whatever the hell you want is actually pretty hard. I’d spent hours wrestling with my genius, working to sunset, toiling over how I should use this incredible editorial freedom.
The Scottish Tenant Farmers Association is backing change. The findings follow last year’s call for evidence by the commission from anyone with experience of living or working in places where most of the land is owned by a small number of people. More than 400 people – including farmers and landowners – submitted evidence. The commission found that where there are adverse economic or social impacts there is little or no method of redress for communities or individuals. It goes on makes a series of recommendations, including a public interest test for significant land transfers.

The institute is being planned on the lines of Central Institute of Plastics Engineering and Technology (CIPET) in case of Plastics and Footwear Design and Development Institute (FDDI) in case of leather industry. Aaround 15 crore tyres are being manufactured in India every year entailing the need for huge manpower to be trained. KOCHI: Underscoring a major need for skilling in rubber and tyre sector, Government has shown its keenness to open a national institute to cater to the training needs of the sector. Rudy also invited the industry to partner with the Government for an institution such as CIPET or FDDI.
The FBI believed King was working with foreign communists, and the attorney general approved wiretaps of his home and offices. There is a myth in this country that in a world where everyone is watched, everyone is watched equally. It’s as if an old and racist J. Edgar Hoover has been replaced by the race-blind magic of computers, mathematicians, and Big Data. The truth is more uncomfortable. Across our history and to this day, people of color have been the disproportionate victims of unjust surveillance; Hoover was no aberration.
NEW DELHI: As the former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee passed away on Thursday, condolences started pouring in from leaders of all the political parties.

A new one-year contract freshly inked, Randall Cobb is eagerly anticipating what lies ahead in Dallas. The Cowboys' free-agent pickup spoke to the team's official website and is optimistic about where the offense is headed. "I think you look at this offense, you look at this team, a playoff team that is a contender, I think I can provide a valuable piece to this team, and I'm excited to get started," Cobb said, per the Cowboys' official website. Earlier in Cobb's career, his versatility was utilized out wide, in the slot and in the backfield.
On Aug. 6, 1945, the United States dropped a uranium-fueled atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. Three days later, another U.S. Army Air Forces B-29 repeated the attack on Nagasaki, Japan, with an even more powerful plutonium bomb. Less than a month after the second bombing, Imperial Japan agreed to formally surrender on Sept. 2. That date marked the official end of World War II -- the bloodiest human or natural catastrophe in history, accounting for more than 65 million dead. Each August, Americans in hindsight ponder the need for, the morality of, and the strategic rationale behind the dropping of the two bombs.
Amarillo native Ryan Palmer shot a 77 and finished 17 shots out of the lead at 290. Palmer took home a check for $16,560. Tiger Woods suffered a back spasm on the par-5 13th hole and hooked a fairway metal so far left that it landed in a swamp on the other side of the 15th fairway, leading to bogey. He dropped another shot on the 15th, and then gamely birdied the 16th and 17th holes to pull within one shot of Scott. Woods' putt from the back of the 18th green was one turn short of falling to force a playoff.
DIDIER DROGBA has been told to get used to life on the bench at Chelsea. The Blues striker is back in Big Phil Scolari’s squad for tonight’s Carling Cup clash with Burnley after his recent knee trouble. But the 30-year-old will not dislodge in-form hitman Nicolas Anelka and has been warned he faces a battle to win back his first-team place. Chelsea assistant coach Ray Wilkins said: “I think Scolari’s quite happy for one of the guys to sit out and one to play. Hopefully, Didier will face a fight to get back in.
BBC World Service - What If..., What If... We All Had A Car? As the number of cars on the road increases, new vehicles are being developed to reduce congestion, pollution and even the need for car ownership. There are over a billion cars in the world today, and there could be as many as four billion by the middle of the century. So how will we keep the roads moving and prevent pollution rising? Theo Leggett meets the people developing new cars that can fold, drive themselves and even communicate with each other.
EDITOR'S NOTE: Ron Hart took the week off, but he sent along this fan favorite for our readers to enjoy. For the 40-and-unders out there, you know how you use the word “like” in like every other sentence? Don’t! When folks my age, those who can remember the TV show "Cheers," interview you for a job, the use of the word “like” as some filler crutch word is maddening. And when done in a high-pitched, nasal, Kardashian-Valley Girl way, it’s akin to torturing us.
BOSTON – The recovering economy and looming retirement of the baby boomers are making this a very good year to be a college senior looking for a job after graduation. Recruiters, career counselors and students say the fall recruiting season has been the most active since the dot.com boom. College hiring is expected to increase 13 percent over last year, according to a new survey from National Association of Colleges and Employers (search). Seven out of 10 employers said they expected to increase salary offers to new college grads, according to the survey released late last week, with an average increase of 3.7 percent.
The night Deontae Davis heard the gunshots that would fatally wound Indianapolis' first homicide victim of 2016, they only reaffirmed for him how dangerous his east-side neighborhood had become. "You know, it's just crazy out here," Davis, 24, told IndyStar on Jan. 4 as he stood in the biting cold and watched detectives file in and out of Arlington Green apartments. Terry Williams, 19, had just been found dead in a hallway on the second floor, and Davis said he'd heard the gunshots from his house up the street.
"Who has the power? People have the power!" Small, slender Dolores Huerta, with her soft but firm voice, was whipping up a crowd at a Los Angeles rally against an oil pipeline in North Dakota. Dozens of people boisterously echoed her words. "She's an icon," actress Jane Fonda told AFP. Fonda, who had organized the protest, has frequently crossed paths with the indefatigable militant Huerta, an activist in an impressive array of movements: for union, feminist, ecologist and human rights -- and for nonviolence.

SO, after more than a week of speculation and all sorts of theories over the cause of the “mysterious” blast that rocked Chitungwiza’s Zengeza 2 high-density suburb, police have finally revealed the source of the explosion — that it was “an explosive” — a bomb, a landmine or some such explosive. The police issued an official statement on Tuesday to the effect that people could be going around stealing and selling bombs! The belief, said national police spokesperson Charity Charamba, was that inside these bombs was some substance called red mercury which fetched millions of dollars on the black market.
VMware says its ESX Server is a comparable, but better product than Microsoft's Hyper-V.
No sooner had Microsoft announced the availability of the public beta for Hyper-V, its hypervisor-based server virtualization technology, than VMware went on the attack, claiming its ESX Server is a comparable, but better, product. "Hyper-V is Microsoft's hypervisor, while ESX Server is ours. But I don't think you can really compare Microsoft's newly announced beta offering and our product, which has been available for seven years," Bogomil Balkansky, VMware's senior director of product marketing, told eWEEK.

Biopics usually occupy one of two lanes: glossy, Hollywood-friendly products or historical-leaning narratives that pay more service to the facts of reality. It looked like we were going to get the latter when Peter Morgan was first announced as the writer of what would eventually become Bohemian Rhapsody, and for a time, that was exciting. But then the project that eventually became director Bryan Singer's version of events was executed, and while there's moments of energy within, it's mostly a cotton candy telling of the life and times of Freddie Mercury and Queen.
Now the media industry has an even bigger reason to fret about cord-cutting and cord-shaving. With ESPN’s decision to begin offering an over-the-top package for its service, joining the likes of HBO, the prospect of snipping the cable cord just became compelling for even more consumers. Already, many viewers have begun shifting their viewing to other devices. For starters, the number of video views on smartphones and tablest has more than doubled in the last year, according to the Ooyala third-quarter video index from 2014. The video platform provider predicts that mobile devices will comprise half of all video views later this year.

Brian Passey's Backbeat music review examines Randy Newman's "Dark Matter." Randy Newman has spent so much time in recent years scoring films that we haven’t been treated to a pop album in nearly a decade. — Randy Newman, lyrics from "Putin"
The most brilliant moment comes as Newman calls himself out through the character of a “true believer” who admits to believing in both Jesus and evolution. The true believer notes that the songwriter, Mr. Newman, is an atheist and commonist, who creates one-dimensional religious straw men as objects of ridicule.
Young M.A cruises through the night and Action Bronson seems to be tripping. Today's Daily Visuals. Young M.A’s been back on her grizzly as of late and last month dropped a cut on Madden 19 called “Car Confessions” and today she comes through with a clip for the joint. Driving through the night in a big boy Benz, the Brooklynite takes in the atmosphere of the city lights while getting her rhyme on in the comforts of some plush luxury leather. We kinda feel she should’ve did an Taxi Cab Confessions themed clip with her serving as an Uber driver or something but this works too.
There won't be a party to mark Athens resident Leila Denmark's 114th birthday today, but several family members will visit, and dozens of relatives and friends have sent cards to celebrate the supercentenarian's life and many contributions to the community. Her mom never did care for cake, said daughter Mary Hutcherson. In past years, Denmark - a noted pediatrician who practiced medicine until she retired at 103 years old - refused the cake because of its sugar content. "Mother would always make a big to-do about eating the birthday cake," Hutcherson said.
Doing business in Russia is a fascinating experience for many reasons. It is almost always a multicultural experience involving some combination of participants from countries of virtually every continent, in addition to Russians. But for me the most intriguing part is the Russians themselves, as well as the complex set of perspectives that shape the prism through which any individual Russian views a personal or business relationship or decision. This essay explores one of the less apparent, but powerful, factors that forms an important component of many Russians’ view of the world and life.

Where Is Karl Rove's Feared American Crossroads Machine? The super PAC was a major player in the 2012 election. But so far, it hasn't spent a dime on midterm elections. If 2012 was the campaign of the super PAC, 2013 is shaping up to prove the maxim that there's an unceasing appetite for groups to spend money in politics. But there's one power player that's lying low in the off year: Karl Rove's American Crossroads. Even with the influx of outside cash, the granddaddy of all super PACs hasn't spent a dime on campaign activity this year.
Dr Johnny Ryan, speaking in a former role at The Irish Times, has filed a complaint against the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe. A formal complaint has been lodged with the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) against the main European lobbyist for the online advertising industry. The complaint against the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe (IAB Europe) was made by Dr Johnny Ryan, who works as chief policy and industry officer for privacy-oriented web browser Brave. It relates to a so-called cookie wall, an online barrier that prevents users from accessing the IAB Europe website unless they give certain permissions.
When you provided Hertz with an email from Marriott, you should have received a prompt refund. But there were several problems. First, this happened in the U.K., more than 3,000 miles from your home in Pennsylvania. Yes, it involved two American corporations, but they had European divisions through which they had to channel the request. Making matters even more complicated, you had already initiated a credit card dispute – typically, one of the last options in resolving a complaint – and your credit card issuer had already ruled in Hertz’s favor, even though it was the wrong decision.
How one state is using incentives instead of penalties to boost child support payments More parents than ever are not paying their child support. Parent involvement from the beginning and less automation may be the answer. Why only two states ban marriage for people under 18 years old In 48 states, it is legal for a minor to be married. Yet, legislating child marriage is proving near impossible. Why? Siblings often end up taking care of those with disabilities. Here's what it's like Siblings of those with disabilities are often expected to be caregivers later in life, but most are not ready for it.
WATCH ABOVE: Former Edmonton Eskimos CEO Len Rhodes is running for the UCP in the upcoming spring election. The sudden departure of former Edmonton Eskimos president and CEO Len Rhodes appears to make more sense now — he is entering politics. Rhodes has been appointed as the candidate for the United Conservative Party in the new Edmonton-Meadows constituency. According to Elections Alberta, he registered on Thursday. Rhodes said he had been thinking about getting into politics for “some time,” but was waiting for what he said was the right party under the right leadership.
While many of its oil ventures have been affected by the global oil slump, state energy giant PetroVietnam's gas arm PV Gas is still looking to expand its business abroad, local media have reported. PV Gas has been working with foreign oil and gas companies to acquire their fields since last year, news website Saigon Times Online said on Sunday, citing company chairman Le Nhu Linh. The company said it is ready to spend "hundreds of millions of dollars" investing in overseas gas fields over the next five years, and transport the outputs to Vietnam, according to the website.
Days ahead of the plan’s release, even rank-and-file Republicans are alarmed that they’re being kept in the dark. Rank-and-file House Republicans are increasingly alarmed by the secrecy shrouding the massive tax bill their party leaders plan to ram through Congress next month. Just days ahead of the legislation’s release, GOP members of the House Ways and Means Committee are still in the dark on numerous details being ironed out by the powerful tax-writing committee’s chairman, Kevin Brady (R-Texas), and his staff. And they’re blaming the panel’s top-down approach for the uncertainty.
(CNN) — Kyoto residents have had enough. A surge in tourism in recent years has brought with it an outbreak of dirty toilets and misbehaving travelers. The city of Kyoto is battling the problem in what might be seen as a typically Japanese way -- issuing polite guidelines amplified by adorable graphics to illustrate their annoyance. Kyoto's Tourism and MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conventions, Exhibitions) promotion office has shared two separate etiquette guides -- "How to Use this Toilet" and "Insider Guide to Kyoto Part II: AKiMaHen (Don'ts) of Kyoto" -- on the city's official website.
Sen. John McCain rarely spoke on his religious beliefs but mentioned keeping faith as a prisoner of war. Arizonans will honor the life of Sen. John McCain at a memorial service at North Phoenix Baptist Church. McCain and his family attended the church for many years. The service will be held at 10 a.m. Thursday. McCain, who was raised Episcopal and later attended a Phoenix Baptist church with his family, rarely spoke publicly about his Christian beliefs. However, when talking about his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, he often shared how he was able to keep faith.
More than one in four Apple iPhones break or fail within two years, a company that provides after-sale warranties said today. SquareTrade, which sells extended warranties for the iPhone, said that 26% of Apple's smartphone suffer a breakdown - or simply breakage - within the first two years. But that's an improvement over the iPhone's past reliability rating. "Twenty-six percent is actually pretty good," said Vince Tseng, vice president of marketing at SquareTrade. "And it's encouraging that the failure rates have decreased."
The number of Fidelity 401(k) accounts with a balance of $1 million or more reportedly jumped to 168,000 in the second quarter of 2018, up 41 percent from a year earlier. "The stock market's performance over the past several years has definitely helped retirement savers, but now would be a good time for investors to take a moment and make sure they are doing their part to meet their retirement goals," Kevin Barry, president of workplace investing at Fidelity Investments, told CNBC in a statement. About 3 in 10 savers increased their contribution rate during the last year, Fidelity found.
So it seems the longtime president of the Municipal Art Society, Kent Barwick, who’s run the preservationist organization for nearly four decades, is stepping down. The Crain’s story reporting this news, which we happened across today, notes the Society’s major accomplishments under Barwick: leading the effort to save Grand Central, preventing Mort Zuckerman from building huge towers on the old Coliseum site that would have cast large shadows on Central Park, pushing for waterfront parks and development, and, Society chairman Philip Howard told Crain’s, “building a magnificent new Moynihan Station.” Oh?
Many Iowans say it just wouldn’t be the holiday season without a real evergreen tree in the corner of the family room. Still, if those trees have been up for a few weeks now, they can pose a fire risk unless a few common-sense precautions are followed. Fire inspector Bill Moody says to check the lights for exposed wires and never place the tree near the fireplace. With live trees, he says to always make sure they have sufficient water. Moody says when you bring it home, cut off about a half-inch from the trunk to have a fresh cut so it’ll start taking water.

Public servants who are indifferent to the needs and concerns of citizens will be removed, president Cyril Ramaphosa said during his first ANC manifesto launch on Saturday. "Many of our public servants are committed and dedicated professionals who perform their tasks faithfully," he told party supporters at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. "However, there are some whose indifference to the needs and concerns of citizens has led to a deterioration in the quality of services and assistance rendered." Ramaphosa said this would change. "For decades, our movement has been defined by selfless service to the people," Ramaphosa said.
Coventry City appear to have lost out in a bid to sign Queens Park Rangers winger Abdenasser El Khayati as manager Russell Slade gets down to his final round of business in the January transfer window. The Sky Blues boss is believed to have been interested in the 27-year-old Dutchman, of Moroccan origin, who is expected to be made available for loan after falling out of favour at the Championship club under manager Ian Holloway. But City face competition from League One rivals Oxford United who are reported to be close to agreeing a deal to take the player to the Kassam Stadium.
The Election Commission (EC) on Wednesday directed the Centre to stop the implementation of the 4.5% quota for minorities in the five election-bound states till the poll process is over. The government had announced its decision to carve out the 4.5% sub-quota from the 27% reservation for OBCs on December 22, two days before poll dates were out and the model code of conduct kicked in. In a retrospective decision, the EC has made the code applicable to the quota decision and instructed the ministry of personnel not to implement it in Goa, Manipur, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.
Special United States envoy Sol Linowitz is setting the pace and style of the three-sided marathon talks on Palestinian autonomy under way in this tranquil seaside resort. But Israel appears to be determining the parameters of the negotiations. Mr. Linowitz's preferences for bilateral discussions and for minimal public disclosure are being respected by his counterparts, Israeli Interior Minister Yosef Burg and Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil. The negotiating schedule calls for an almost daily routine through May 8, after which the talks resume in Egypt until the May 26 target date for an autonomy agreement.
Great chemistry leads to great music. Mick and Keith, Page and Plant, Lennon and McCartney - the list goes on. And in this country, when you talk about contributions to rock 'n roll, you've gotta mention Randy Bachman and Fred Turner. In the early '70s, Randy had just parted ways with his first band, 'The Guess Who.' (Perhaps you've heard of them?). So, Randy formed his own band, Bachman Turner Overdrive, and it didn't take long for BTO to make their mark.

The Good Fast black text and graphics prints; excellent text handling; good graphics prints; inexpensive. The Bad High consumables cost; limited functionality; no duplexer; nonexpandable memory. The Bottom Line The Lexmark C500n is a fast color laser printer fit for a multiuser environment with high-volume printing needs. The competition offers more features, but slower printing or lower-quality prints. The Lexmark C500n is a basic, single-function color laser printer geared for small offices and home offices. After reviewing a bunch of multifunction color printers recently, $400 seems like a lot for a single-function machine.
This post originally appeared in the Winter 2013 issue of The Learning System. A truism in education is that professional learning is a process, not an event. Nevertheless, many educators continue to experience learning as an isolated activity. The thinking, talking, and planning of school system and school leaders may focus primarily on professional learning as a workshop, skill development session, college course, or a conference. While leaders may hope that educators will use their new learning to improve their practice, often they don't ensure there is the time or support necessary to produce that result.
Over the course of their career, most civilian professionals are trained to communicate according to certain industry and company “norms.” While there are style variances and tone differences, professionalism when communicating via email should always follow certain guidelines to be received as polished, focused, and compelling. Focus on message, not brevity. While getting the point across matters, the context surrounding the message also counts. Civilians tend to add many instances of “please” and “thank you” to messages making them less pointed and direct, and more welcoming and collaborative. Write the way they speak.
If you go through Chetan Bhagat's Twitter feed, you would come across tonnes of promotional tweets about upcoming film 'Half Girlfriend' based on his book of the same name. But one particular tweet may catch your attention. According to the tweet, his book will soon become a part of English literature syllabus at Delhi University. The bestselling author took to Twitter to express his gratitude for the 'honour' while fighting off critics of the supposed move. Am honoured DU added my books to their course. Literature is about being open minded, reading the classics as well as the contemporary.
It’s a sentiment echoed across the country and throughout time as Americans struggle to balance the memory of an often-ugly past with sensitivity to those for whom its commemoration is offensive. Should we be honoring figures who committed terrible deeds? Is relegating them to books and museums tantamount to erasing our history? Those questions came once again to the fore this summer when the South Carolina Legislature, following a racially motivated shooting at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church that left nine worshippers dead, voted to remove the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse grounds for the first time in five decades.
To anyone who a) doesn’t believe that restaurant customers actually go as batshit as frequently appears in BCO, and b) also believes that they never face some small measure of justice for it, I give you this video. In it, an enraged customer is upset over a laundry list of offenses, including that they speak a language other than English, gave her son green peppers instead of red because he “doesn’t eat green things!”, and that preparing replacement food would, in accordance with the principles of causation, take time.
Excitement is building in Stamford, following the arrival of the Osiligi Maasai Warriors who will be performing tribal song and dance, plus the world famous Maasai jumping at All Saints’ Church. The seven-piece group, from the village of Oleopolos and surrounding communities in southern Kenya, will perform in Stamford on Saturday, October 24, as part of their annual tour of the UK. The group will perform authentic and exciting Maasai tribal song and dance plus the world-famous Maasai jumping. Since 2010, the group has worked in close association with a small UK charity - Osiligi Charity Projects - to support infrastructural improvements in their local community.
The U.S. Department of Justice has repealed a policy seen as being lax on antitrust violations, signaling a more aggressive approach toward antitrust enforcement under the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama. The DOJ's Antitrust Division has withdrawn a September report that "raised too many hurdles to government antitrust enforcement and favored extreme caution" toward antitrust enforcement action, the DOJ said. The change in policy could mean that the DOJ looks harder at the actions of technology vendors such as Google, Oracle and IBM, as detractors have raised antitrust concerns about all three in recent months.
A German computer insecurity expert claims he can prove that the United States and Israel's Mossad wrote the Stuxnet worm to knock off Iran's nuclear program. Ralph Langner told the TED conference in the Southern California city of Long Beach that while Mossad was behind planting the worm the leading source was the United States. The malicious code was crafted to stealthily take control of valves and rotors at an Iranian nuclear plant, according to Langner. He said that it was engineered by people who obviously had inside information and probably knew the shoe size of the operator.
It wasn't so much a phoney war in Croke Park on Saturday night but a frozen skirmish. A repeat of last year's league final and one of 2019's All-Ireland semi-finals, there were no markers laid down on Saturday evening or statements made. Instead, Dublin and Galway stretched their legs in each other's company and the biting February cold, with the former finding a higher level in the second half thus avoiding back-to-back league defeats for the first time under Jim Gavin. Quite how that level measured up against their exalted standards was difficult to tell but equally, it didn't seem particularly relevant on Saturday.
There was an old woman who supported a hermit. For twenty years she always had a girl, sixteen or seventeen years old, take the hermit his food and wait on him. The girl went back and told this to the old woman. The woman said, “For twenty years I’ve supported this vulgar good-for-nothing!” So saying, she threw the monk out and burned down the hermitage. In August of 1990 I was in deep into my clinical pastoral education unit at the Pacific Presbyterian Hospital in San Francisco. It was the weekend and I was on call.
Kacey Musgraves was stunned that her album Golden Hour won the 2019 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The night's big prize went to a country album for the first time in nearly a decade. Fighting back tears, the 30-year-old Musgraves said how she felt honored to just be in a category with the seven other nominees. She also talked about the importance of music in life and her life. "I would have nothing without songs to me. It's just all about the songs," she said, stunned and struggling for words after accepting her second award of the night and her fourth total.
$60 million deal expected to close shortly. Online payments company PayPal, a unit of eBay, will buy Israeli cyber security company CyActive for $60 million, Israeli media reported. The Globes financial newspaper said the deal is expected to close shortly. A spokeswoman for CyActive, which was founded in 2013, declined to comment on the reports. CyActive, which says it can forecast future cyber attacks and offer companies such as utilities detection and prevention, received a strategic investment from the venture capital unit of Siemens in September. Financial details were not disclosed.
One of the best ways to view Punta Cana is to get off the resort and take a boat tour. Various operators offer different experiences, from private catamarans to group snorkeling trips. One of the most well reviewed tour operators is Hispaniola Aquatic Adventures, which has a fleet of catamarans for private and semi-private tours that take visitors to snorkeling reefs, deserted beaches and lagoons. Along with transportation to and from area hotels, Hispaniola Aquatic Adventures also offers guests drinks and lunch. The company's four-hour tour starts at $99 per person for a semi-private tour; private tours for groups of up to seven people cost $650.
WASHINGTON – Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating claims the Trump campaign colluded with Russia over the 2016 election, and possibly other topics the public may know nothing about. He’s been on “the case” only a few months, since ex-FBI Director James Comey was fired, but the review, going back into last year, hasn’t produced any evidence yet, and Mueller’s now putting his agenda before a grand jury. And his investigators have gone to the White House requesting documents concerning former national security adviser Gen. Michael Flynn.
The National Governors' Association has created a task force to determine what essential skills the schools should be teaching. Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, the newly elected chairman of the n.g.a., named Govs. Carroll A. Campbell of South Carolina and Bill Clinton of Arkansas to head the new panel. Their appointment was announced at the n.g.a. 's annual meeting in Chicago this summer. It will then turn its energy to a yearlong study of the skills students need to have mastered to be internationally competitive. Called for the U.S. Education Department to help states and localities examine choice and magnet-school options for public schools.
The U.S. Supreme Court famously dodged a big opportunity to rule on the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering earlier this year. And with the key swing justice who was open to limits on the practice, Anthony Kennedy, retiring, presumably to be replaced by a standard conservative jurist like Brett Kavanaugh, the odds of SCOTUS doing anything about the unpopular and unsavory practice of map-rigging are low. The emails, disclosed in a filing on Monday, boast of concentrating “Dem garbage” into four of the five southeast Michigan districts that Democrats now control, and of packing African-Americans into a metropolitan Detroit House district.
The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo won the Guldbagge Award, which is Sweden's version of the Oscar. It's based on the first crime novel in Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy. Stieg Larsson was a journalist whose trilogy was published posthumously. The books made him one of the best-selling authors in the world. This film also has become one the biggest grossing movies in European cinema. When on the Charlie Rose show, its Danish director, Niels Arden Oplev, described the movie as playing like a modern Agatha Christie mystery but with a dark angel at its center, an attraction in and of herself.
While Mark Zuckerberg makes his way up Forbes’ list of America’s richest people, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes develops a site designed to help the world’s poor. Could the gravest threat to national security be the intelligence community itself…and the male libido? Need to Know talks to author and satirist Gary Shteyngart, whose new dystopian, darkly humorous novel “Super Sad True Love Story” foretells the ruinous decline of literacy in America. Anne Rolfes of the Bucket Brigade talks to Need to Know about the creative deployment of technology in the Gulf cleanup efforts.
NEW DELHI – The headless body of a three-year-old boy snatched from his home by a leopard in India was handed over to his parents on Tuesday, wildlife officials said. Local officials in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir have sought “elimination orders” from the state government. It was the third such killing blamed on the leopard in the last two months, including an eight-year-old boy mauled to death in the area on December 7. In the meantime, a team of wildlife officials equipped with tranquilizer guns have been scouring the area to spot the animal.
Sir Richard Branson plans to hold talks with the government about paying for a new oil refinery. The Virgin Atlantic boss told the BBC he wanted to reduce his airline fuel bill, which has increased by £300m a year over the last two years. He said there was an "enormous shortage" of oil refineries and said he was looking at building one. Fuel prices have been hitting record highs due to the knock-on effect of Hurricane Katrina in the US. Sir Richard's comments came as a price war broke out between petrol retailers as oil supplies returned to normal following the chaos caused by the hurricane.
Now that we're about a month from the presidential election, most astute voters are doing some research. They're watching the debates; scouring newspapers, magazines and blogs for facts about the candidates' positions, talking with respected friends or colleagues and consulting their local humor columnist. Actually, nix that last one. No one really wants to know how I'm voting, or the reasons for my decision. Readers turn to this column to escape the barrage of anti-Obama, anti-McCain, anti-Biden and anti-Palin vitriol. And I will not disappoint.
Avengers: Infinity War, the 19th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, has been described as the culmination of the entire MCU thus far. It’s truly a movie of epic proportions, as the Avengers are called upon to assemble and battle their greatest threat yet: Thanos. Josh Brolin’s purple-colored baddie has been teased since the end of The Avengers as a galactic force with an eye for collecting all of the Infinity Stones, which we’ve seen in various forms throughout the MCU (the tesseract from Avengers, Dark Aether from Thor: The Dark World, Vision’s mind stone, etc.)
The first female chief of the IMF on the Greek meltdown, a historic refugee crisis and one thing Hillary Clinton has in common with an "old crocodile." The morning scene at New York’s Carlyle Hotel is about the most perfect illustration of the term “power breakfast” that you could envision. On the ground floor of the opulent art deco hotel—a longtime favorite of American presidents, and the preferred Manhattan residence of visitors from Princess Diana to Mick Jagger to George Clooney—impeccably attired men enjoyed the buffet as several different security details milled about the lobby.
LJUBLJANA, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Slovenia will ban the registration of new cars running on petrol or diesel fuel from 2030, the government said on Thursday. It also issued a draft development strategy under which the country plans to cut public debt to 60 percent of GDP, the maximum level allowed for European Union members, by 2030. “New registration (from 2030) will only be possible for cars with CO2 emissions of less than 50 grams per kilometer,” a government statement said, adding that only electric and plug-in hybrid cars fulfill such criteria at present.
Are My Husband's Daily Naps a Problem? Question: My husband is in his early 70s and takes several naps every day — in the morning and the afternoon — which last an hour or so. He is usually in bed by 9 p.m., and up early. Is this odd schedule bad for his health? Your husband has a routine that is certainly unusual, but it clearly meets his needs for sleep. Unless he has health problems that can be tied to his sleep schedule (anxiety, cognitive disorders, heart issues), I don't see a reason to worry.

LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - New steel and alumina contracts have the best chance of succeeding as the London Metal Exchange unleashes 10 new products early next year in an attempt to compete more effectively with rival exchanges, industry sources said. The new products range from hot rolled coil (HRC) steel to alumina, the raw material for aluminium, as well as cobalt, which is key for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The 141-year-old LME also plans to launch a contract for lithium, another important metal for EVs, but that will come later, perhaps in 2020.

Queensland State of Origin great Gene Miles was expecting to meet Arthur Beetson at a Gold Coast theme park when he heard the news. As part of a program named in his honour, ARTIE - Achieving Results Through Indigenous Education - Beetson was to help give 400 indigenous children the chance to celebrate what they had achieved during the course.

Q. What quality do you most want to see in the next coach? A. In today’s NBA, one of the important things particularly in a market like Charlotte (which can’t live off free agency) is player development: getting those draft picks and developing them. We have the G-League team in Greensboro. We have to use all those resources. I can remember when I first got involved in basketball (in the late 1980s) it was a seven months (a year) business. Not to say people took off, but it wasn’t as intense.
New York (TADIAS) — “In 1935, Benito Mussolini wanted to make Italy great again, so he invaded Ethiopia,” The Daily Beast publication noted this summer. The new documentary film “If Only I Were That Warrior” — which chronicles the reactions of the international Ethiopian and Italian community regarding the recent building of a memorial for the Fascist General, Rodolfo Graziani (“The Butcher of Ethiopia”) in his hometown of Affile, Italy — has finally been released on DVD and is also now available for streaming online.
The Allied Invasion of Normandy was one of the single most logistically and strategically complex maneuvers ever concocted by the US military. With a strike force numbering in the hundreds of thousands and the momentum of the entire counter-offensive hanging in the balance, there was simply no room for failure. In The Americans on D-Day, author Martin K.A. Morgan guides readers from the run up to the invasion through to its horrific aftermath with the help of hundreds of gorgeous sepia-toned archival images. Perhaps the best remembered aspect of the Operation Fortitude deception effort that preceded D-Day was the inflatable Sherman tank.

The South Pacific nation of almost 5 million people is reeling from last week’s apparently well-planned terrorist attack. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s Cabinet will begin overhauling New Zealand’s gun laws on Monday after the nation’s worst mass shooting in modern history left 50 people dead. The gunman opened fire on worshippers in two mosques in the South Island city of Christchurch on Friday, and live-streamed the attack to social media. Police recovered two semi-automatic weapons, two shotguns and a lever-action firearm, which the attacker could own legally because he had a category-A gun license.

He was trained as a physicist and practiced physics, Earth sciences, and environmental science, areas in which he was funded by a national agency and ran an internationally recognized laboratory. He published over 100 articles in leading scientific journals. He developed popular activism courses and was an outspoken critic of the university administration and a defender of Palestinian rights. He was fired for his dissidence in 2009 by a president who is a staunch supporter of Israeli policy.
BROOKHAVEN, MS (WLBT) - At the age of 17, James White told his parents that he wanted to join the military. His mother Laurie White says at 17 she had to give written permission for him to join. “I mean if we didn’t sign, he was going to do it when he turned 18, so we just went ahead and done it,” White said. “I worried everyday, I prayed every day,” she said. White, who the family calls Kevin, was deployed to Afghanistan during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Drew Brees is getting better. Let that marinate for a bit in a city where spices and sauces upgrade the value of everything. Brees, who was already pretty good, has evolved into scary good, which has to frighten the pants off the San Francisco 49ers. Without question, Brees is the primary reason the New Orleans Saints have transformed themselves from the league's perennial doormat to the doorstep of a powerhouse. That's what could happen if Brees' Saints can win three more games, including today's NFC divisional playoff with the 49ers, and claim their second Super Bowl title in three seasons.
A 10-goal game by junior Kaila Carroll propelled the Greenwich High School water polo team to a 21-13 win over visiting Greenwich Academy in a match held on Tuesday.

Kaitlin Ganshaw tallied five times and Avery Sammons added a goal for the Gators.
Gov. Ron DeSantis’ call to ban “fracking” advanced Tuesday in the House and Senate as environmentalists argue the proposals don’t go far enough and the petroleum industry fights to allow the controversial drilling technique. With the groups opposing the bills for different reasons, some lawmakers were left explaining their support as the House Agriculture & Natural Resources Appropriations Subcommittee voted 10-2 to ban “hydraulic fracturing” for oil and natural gas (HB 7029). Later, the Senate Innovation, Industry, and Technology Committee narrowly approved a broader version (SB 7064) that includes provisions on drilling in the Everglades.
Nortel Networks acquires CRM vendor Clarify Inc.
With plans to set off what they are calling the “second wave of eBusiness”, Nortel Networks Corp. and San Jose, Calif.-based Clarify Inc. announced in October that Nortel will acquire the front office software provider through a merger agreement. At press time, the definitive merger agreement had been signed. But the deal had not been closed yet, and isn’t expected to be final until December or even as late as January 2000, according to Ben Kiker, vice-president of corporate marketing at Clarify.
It's a fact: Whole-grain flour is better for you than white flour. So if you haven't already switched, it's probably worth trading white bread for wheat, regular waffles for whole grain, buttermilk pancakes for ... you get the point. But when it comes to English muffins, the complaint is always the same: "They're too chewy!" "It's like eating rubber!" We've even heard someone swear the whole-wheat versions have less nooks and crannies. We decided it was time for our Taster's Choice panel to put them to the test.
February 29, 2016  Author Nancy Jo Sales says the Internet fosters a kind of sexism that is harmful to teen girls. Her new book is American Girls: Social Media and the Secret Lives of Teenagers. Are You Liking Facebook's New Emojis? Scrap That. Do You 'Wow' Them? February 24, 2016  Facebook rolled out five new emojis globally. Now, users can not only "like" a post but also choose "haha," "angry" and other options. Users are taking to social media to voice their reactions.
A suspicious purchase and quick-thinking Bunnings employees helped to stop what could have been Australia's most devastating terror attack. The trio were found guilty by the Supreme Court on November 2 of acts in preparation for an attack targeting Federation Square, St Paul's Cathedral and Flinders St station in December 2016. The verdict, made public yesterday after legal delays, followed seven days of deliberations in the jury room and eight weeks of evidence including from Hamza's older brother Ibrahim Abbas, 24, who confessed his involvement to police and pleaded guilty earlier this year.
The drive to clean up the SABC has been given another blow with allegations of an irregularly awarded security tender. A preliminary Special Investigating Unit (SIU) probe has found that a R185m SABC security tender was irregularly awarded by its interim board and should be set aside. The interim board was appointed in 2017 to resolve challenges at the public broadcaster but has now found itself in crisis following the resignations of four of its board members in December. These findings will cast a shadow over President Cyril Ramaphosa's drive to clean up the SABC, which has reported losses exceeding R1.5bn over the past two financial years.
Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the developed world. According to Ash (Action on Smoking and Health) smoking accounts for about 100,000 deaths a year in Britain alone. It is generally accepted that e-cigarettes deliver nicotine in a safer way than traditional cigarettes, but new research published in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research claims there are huge variations in the amount of nicotine produced by the devices. Researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University have developed the first model that can predict (with up to 90 per cent accuracy) how much nicotine a particular e-cigarette emits.
Studios sometimes cringe at the thought of horror films. They have no reason to do so – people love the genre, and time after time, it plays well at the box office. Yet there remains a stigma around horror – so much so that when a horror movie generates buzz, producers are quick to classify it as something else. “It’s a thriller!” they’ll say. Or, even worse, they’ll declare it to be “elevated horror.” But maybe Us will change all that.
A 25-year-old man living in Washington State has been detained in connection with threats on social media against Skowhegan Area High School and a Maine company that provides services to people with disabilities. Jesus Wellington Kong was taken into custody Tuesday by law enforcement and is being held in Olympia, Washington, for a mental health evaluation. He is charged in federal court with two counts of making interstate threats for violent posts he allegedly wrote on Facebook. He called himself a “war strategist” and said he would “leave a few students in a bloody pool,” according to court documents.
Team Germany's members may all be new to the Solar Decathlon this year, but they learned from the previous team's house--and though it won first place in 2007, they strived to improve upon it. The team increased the size of the building but decreased the area of the windows in order to reduce solar gain; they also placed them more strategically within the structure. As a result, Germany's house is a two-story cube with windows concentrated on the northern and southern sides. The windows are also shaded by automated louvers and triple glazed to have a U value below 0.8.
THE N WYORKER it was not only the obvious conserva- tives who balked at modern art. The N PW Statesman, that bastion of ad- vanced ideas, was more Philistine than the Times. As late as 1940, when Moore showed his great works of the late thirties at the Leicester Galleries, the New Statesman called them "ex- quisite chimney-piece ornaments . . . as deadly dryas late Stravinsky." Moore has never responded to vili- fication. Today, if hooligans tar-and- feather his work, as they have done at least once, he thinks it best to pretend that he hasn't heard ahout it.
Nearly 200 residents of a neighborhood that could be cut off from Rancho Penasquitos in this year's City Council redistricting plan showed up at the Redistricting Commission Monday afternoon to protest. The residents of Park Village, which is tucked between state Route 56 to the north and the Los Penasquitos Canyon Preserve on the south, identify with Rancho Penasquitos. However, the current plan under consideration has them attached to Mira Mesa. "Park Village belongs in Penasquitos,'' resident Jim Cantwell told the commissioners. He said he has lived in the area for 17 years.
Angels manager Mike Scioscia said Wednesday he hasn’t forgotten about the tedious nature of the postseason schedule and had spoken with commissioner Bud Selig about his concerns. Scioscia called it “ridiculous,” during the ALCS, for the Angels to have played only eight games in 21 days. “I’m very hopeful the commissioner is gong to consider tightening up the schedule,” Scioscia said, as he was named American League Manager of the Year. Scioscia’s first priority would be to do away with the two, and sometimes three, off-days that follow the final game of the regular season.
A threatening poster pasted on the boundary wall of Multan Press Club (MPC) hurled the warning of serious consequences to the media, stirring serious concerns among the journalism fraternity here on Friday. The MPC administration suspected that some unidentified miscreants pasted the threatening poster on the boundary wall in wee hours of Friday at around 3:30am. “One of our servants chased them but they managed to escape,” confirmed Shakil Anjum, newly-elected President of Multan Press Club. He disclosed that the poster contained a threatening message from the miscreants, claiming to hit the MPC, CPO and RPO offices at any time.

A motivated Accra Hearts of Oak side tamed Liberty Professionals today at the Dansoman Carl Reindorf Park in a pulsating match that ended 1-0 in favor of the Phobians. The Accra derby lived up to expectations with both teams exhibiting high-intensity football in a bid to reign supreme over the other. The match started with a high tempo as the away side pressed Liberty to deny them the opportunity of playing out their tactics. The deadlock of the game was finally broken after the half-hour mark when Kojo Obeng Jnr jumped above the Liberty defense to head home from the corner kick.
LONGVIEW, TX (KLTV) - A judge has sentenced a Hallsville woman to five years in prison following her guilty plea to a kidnapping charge in connection with an incident which ended in the deaths of two men. Patricia Francine Baker, 22, was sentenced to a charge of aggravated kidnapping Tuesday in Judge J. Scott Novy’s court. She had pleaded guilty to the charge on Dec. 21. Baker was arrested in April 2016 after the deaths of DeKeilen Joe Nelson, 20, of Gilmer, and Kevin Lorenzo Stephenson, 28, of Henderson.
Written by guest blogger Evie Blad. This post first appeared on Rules for Engagement. The U.S. Department of Education will provide an additional $3.1 million grant to the Newtown School District to aid in recovery from the 2012 shooting of 20 students and six adults at an elementary school there, the agency announced today. "I believe that the district ran, for lack of a better word for it, on adrenaline last year," Superintendent Joseph Erardi said in a conference call with reporters. "I am forecasting a more complex--not more difficult but a more complex--year this year than we had last year."

Gov. Gary Herbert&apos;s Medicaid plan faces a make-or-break vote in the state Senate this week, possibly as early as Tuesday. The Republican governor&apos;s plan is an alternative to expanding the state-federal program as envisioned under President Barack Obama&apos;s health care law. After months of negotiating with federal officials, Herbert came away with an agreement to enroll thousands of poor Utah residents in private health plans and require them to help pay costs. It mirrors similar proposals from other Republican governors pushing for a way to expand health coverage under the federal law while keeping it palatable to their right-leaning Legislatures.
A team of 30 skilled volunteers working over six months has developed an independent model of whether it`s feasible for the city of Boulder to form a municipal utility and reduce its carbon emissions for a cost that`s similar to what customers now pay Xcel Energy. The answer is yes, say the volunteers, who will present their findings at a public meeting Wednesday night. "We can cut our current emissions by 50 percent and be comparable to Xcel and be more stable (in terms of rates) over time," said Sam Weaver, co-founder of a power conversion equipment company and one of the volunteer modelers.
After last week’s non-starters, this week we see the release of the much talked about Varun Dhawan – Anushka Sharma starrer SUI DHAAGA – MADE IN INDIA. Set against a rustic backdrop, the film sees Varun playing a tailor and the challenges he faces. But will the film entice the audience is the question of the hour. Reports state that SUI DHAAGA – MADE IN INDIA has opened on a sluggish note with occupancy rates during morning shows being pegged at 15%. On the other hand, the other release of this week PATAAKHA has opened to a 5% occupancy rate.
Samsung Electronics has reported a jump in profit for the last quarter even as competition in the smartphone market remained intense. The company reported sales of 51.7 trillion won (US$45.1 billion) for the quarter, up 9 percent from the same period a year earlier, and net profit of 5.5 trillion won, up 29 percent, Samsung announced Thursday in Korea. The higher sales came largely from strong demand for Samsung's chips and flat-panel displays, which account for more than a third of its total business, while profits were helped by the weak Korean won.

Changing the clocks this weekend might impact people’s sleep schedules for a few days, but isn’t going to have a major impact on anyone … however, repeated sleep loss can have serious consequences. Dr. Victoria Sharma of St. Louis specializes in sleep disorders. She says this weekend’s time change will affect many people’s sleep routine, but most will adjust quickly. But, she says many are losing sleep year-round, which has both immediate and long-term impacts. Sharma says adults need between seven and eight hours of sleep a night — but not more.
White House blames economic turmoil but Democrats point to Iraq and Afghan wars. Analysts say the news means the next US president may be urged to work on slashing the deficit instead of adding to it with expensive spending programmes such as those promised by both candidates. The White House had initially projected a deficit of $410 billion in the 2009 fiscal year, which begins October 1. However the office also predicted that the US economy would grow at a rate of 1.6 per cent this year and rebound further at 2.9 per cent rate next year.
photographed walking without a cane for the first time. That has raised hopes that he may soon be ready to return to acting, taking over the lead of his FXX comedy series. The project, picked up straight-to-series in April 2014, was put on hold following the car crash that claimed the live of Morgan’s mentor and comedy writer James McNair. “We know he wants to do it,” FX Networks CEO John Landgraf told Deadline at TCA today, reiterating the company’s commitment to the series and its willingness to wait as long as it takes for Morgan to fully recover.
Has Melbourne seen the light and fallen out of love with black? We ask Melbourne's fashion set what happened to the city's love affair with black. Industrials led the S&P 500 and the Dow moderately higher after robust US economic data and some healthy corporate earnings reports. Port Adelaide took full advantage of the Eagles' weakness with slippery conditions to post a 42-point win in a rain-soaked Good Friday clash at Optus Stadium. Seven first editions of Ian Fleming's spy novels have been donated to what would normally be an orderly, suburban charity fundraising event.
A broken speed camera in Leeds is flashing drivers who pass through it travelling at BELOW the speed limit. The speed camera on York Road in Killinbeck Leeds has a 40mph speed limit. But the camera has malfunctioned and drivers have contacted the Yorkshire Evening Post to tell us that they have been flashed by the camera even when travelling below the speed limit this morning. A concerned motorist contacted us to say: "There is a bit of worry about it. It's a busy stretch of road (as is all of York Road) so it's a wonder as to how many people have been flashed by it.

Director Ryan Coogler shocked absolutely no one when it was revealed he was returning to Marvel Studios to direct Black Panther 2. And though that project will take up a lot of his time, it might not be the immediate film on his docket. After the initial report indicated Coogler will direct the Black Panther sequel, a report from Variety indicated the film will not go into production until late 2019 or early 2020, leaving him enough time to take on a smaller project. The report states that Coogler could tackle a version of the classic 12 Angry Men, which has been a theatrical staple and adapted for screen multiple times.
Nigerian singer and songwriter, Oluwatosin Ajibade, popularly called Mr Eazi has postponed his US tour scheduled to hold in March due to a delay in his visa. The award winning singer is the pioneer of Banku music, a fusion sound he described as a mixture of Ghanaian highlife and Nigerian chord progressions and patterns.

He took to his Instagram, @mreazi to express his regrets about the postponement. He said that fans would still use the tickets they had purchased when a new dates was rescheduled.
WASHINGTON – U.S. worker productivity fell by the largest amount in a year from January through March. The steeper drop than first estimated suggests companies would need to hire more if demand were to pick up. The Labor Department said Wednesday that productivity fell at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the first quarter. That&apos;s faster than the initial 0.5 percent annual decline for the period estimated last month. Labor costs rose 1.3 percent in the January-March quarter, down from an initial estimate of 2 percent. The decline was largely due to smaller compensation costs.
UPDATE: The bear spotted in Union Beach was put down by police. UNION BEACH -- Police asked residents to stay indoors late Saturday after officers located a "large" bear in a section of Union Beach. The bear was spotted near Edmunds Avenue, Union Beach police said in an alert around 10 p.m.

Scientists have created a new molecule that shows promise for controlling HIV without daily antiretroviral drugs. The molecule foils a wider range of HIV strains in the laboratory than any known broadly neutralizing HIV antibody and is more powerful than some of the most potent of these antibodies. In addition, the molecule safely protected monkeys from infection with an HIV-like virus during a 40-week study period. Together, the data suggest that the molecule could, with further research, be used to subdue HIV in humans. The authors note that the molecule potentially could be used as both a preventative drug and as a treatment.

Editor's note: Stephen Lemons is a blogger and columnist with Phoenix New Times in Phoenix, Arizona. Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- Every movement needs heroes. The fight against discrimination in the state of Arizona just got nine. Sometime before noon Tuesday, nine activists entwined their bodies in a thick steel chain, locking themselves to the doors of the Arizona Capitol in protest against the recently passed Senate Bill 1070, a bill that would open the door to racial profiling in the Grand Canyon state and force all law enforcement officers with "reasonable suspicion" to inquire about the immigration status of those they stop.
Taxi firm Uber has today lost its appeal against a ruling that its drivers should be classed as workers rather than self-employed. In October 2016, the Central London Employment Tribunal ruled that two Uber drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, were Uber staff and entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage. The case was brought by the GMB, the union for professional drivers. Uber fought the ruling, but today, the employment appeal tribunal upheld the original decision. The firm has said it will appeal the latest ruling again.
The Prime Minister of Thailand is to visit Fiji in September when he will be the chief guest at the Pacific Islands Development Forum summit. Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama confirmed the visit of General Prayut Chan-o-cha at a session of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, in Bangkok. The Fiji leader also invited General Prayut to open a diplomatic mission in Suva. The Thai prime minister will join a growing list of Asian leaders who have visited Fiji since last year. In November, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Fiji, closely followed by the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
With permission Mr Speaker I should like to make a statement about our programme of constitutional renewal. With this Statement are published a White Paper, the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill, and an analysis of the responses to our consultations. Copies of these are available in the Vote Office and on my ministry's website. Mr Speaker, the accountability of government is fundamental to the health of our democracy. Arbitrary action and lack of transparency can subvert that. But, for decades, the royal prerogative has been used by successive governments to sustain executive power.

In the heat of an election year, with the two presidential candidates running in a closely contested race, there’s a lot to consider for Americans who want to make an informed decision on which candidate to vote for. There’s a lot at stake in this election, a clear choice between Republican Mitt Romney wanting to the return to the Constitution of the United States as opposed to a more socialistic approach, and incumbent Barack Obama, especially in view of the current economic climate, and the direction we are to go in the future.
The Catskill Mountains of southeastern New York are several hours northwest of New York City, west of the Hudson River and roughly cover four counties. Considered the frontier in Colonial days, the area was dubbed the "Borscht Belt" or "Jewish Alps" in the mid-20th century for the hotels, resorts, camps and cottage colonies favored by New York City Jews escaping from the city's heat in the summer. With mountains, cool lakes, numerous streams and rivers and small towns scattered among the forests and farmlands, the area is rich in natural beauty, culture and history.
Wall Street, fed up with a barrage of attacks from President Barack Obama, is abandoning the incumbent President and throwing is considerable weight and wealth behind presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney. And Romney’s new-found friends have money to burn. Wall Street execs wrote checks for $8.5 million to Romney through the end of April, compared to $3 million for Obama. That’s a sharp turnaround from 2008 when Obama raked in $16 million while GOP contender John McCain had to make do with a paltry $9 million. And who leads the list of financial fatcats taking out their checkbooks for Mitt?
Published: June 25, 2012 at 11:25 a.m. The buzzword for the Miami Dolphins' offense this offseason: up-tempo. The team wants more pace, more no-huddle and more short routes like any good West Coast offense. That direction, combined with increased competition at tight end, has the Palm Beach Post wondering if Anthony Fasano still fits. "For me it means more perimeter blocking and running short routes where we get the ball out, substituting shorter passes for longer ones," Fasano said last week. "Second-and-short is traditionally a running down but we're going to pass a lot."
Their festive special is a rollicking 60-minute Moroccan adventure, but for the Birds Of A Feather stars the real dramas are closer to home – especially when it comes to Christmas dinner. However, Pauline Quirke has help at hand if she needs it, thanks to her famous neighbour. “I wouldn’t do that to her,” insists Pauline. “I can’t just go: ‘Mary, throw us over a tiramisu!’ But I’m not good with desserts. Myself, Linda and Lesley are all busy in panto, so it’s going to be a slightly different Christmas.

"Today's vehicles shine more brightly than ever with a level of quality, design brilliance, and tech savvy that has never been seen before."
“After Midnight,” a musical revue, would make one envious of those patrons who held front row seats in the original Cotton Club of the 1920s. “After Midnight” takes the audience back to the Jazz Age at the height of the Harlem Renaissance under the superb direction and choreography of Warren Carlyle. “After Midnight” is a must-see show because Carlyle’s choreography breathes fresh air into an all too familiar Harlem Jazz-Age theme. Watching “After Midnight” makes the audience believe one is actually witnessing the kind of talent that would have graced the stages at places like the Cotton Club.

Review reveals more than 300,000 records breached. The hacking of the US Internal Revenue Service has been revealed to be more extensive than previously reported, with nearly three times as many taxpayers hit by data theft. The IRS said in late May the tax return information of about 114,000 taxpayers had been illegally accessed by cyber criminals over the preceding four months, with a further 111,000 unsuccessful attempts made. A new review has identified 220,000 additional incidents where data was breached, the tax collection agency said. It identified another 170,000 suspected failed attempts by third parties to gain access to taxpayer data.
CHELSEA star Gonzalo Higuain has demanded Maurizio Sarri snap him up on a permanent transfer despite his poor form of late. Chelsea have been seriously lacking up front all season with Alvaro Morata and Olivier Giroud their only forward options at the start. Morata continued his woeful form from last season, scoring just five goals in the Premier League before Sarri lost patience and implored his Blues bosses to offload the Spaniard. The former Juventus ace was sent to Atletico Madrid on a loan deal until the end of the season and one of the Italian coach’s old players was brought in to replace him.
The Oklahoma Sooners are back to the top spot of the Big 12 Power Rankings after a second straight convincing victory in conference play. This week, Kansas State was the victim of 51-14 beatdown thanks to 398 total yards and four touchdowns from Kyler Murray. The Sooners have found their rhythm since the Texas loss, and are moving full steam ahead in the second half of the season. The Mountaineers are back on track following their first loss of the season. West Virginia picked off Baylor quarterback Charlie Brewer three times and ended up with a season high 58 points in the Thursday night victory.
ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — John Elway insists Joe Flacco is at the top of his game at age 34 even though the former Baltimore Ravens quarterback hasn’t thrown a pass in the playoffs since 2015. That echoed comments Elway made Wednesday when he told the NFL Network that Flacco’s “arm strength is still great” and “he’s just going into his prime,” even though the veteran QB was supplanted by rookie Lamar Jackson last season and didn’t play in the Ravens’ wild-card loss to the Chargers.
Mobile’s not really the new thing anymore. And marketing automation, in spite of the fact that it is tripling annually and still unused by more than 90 percent of non-tech companies, isn’t all that new anymore either. Mobile marketing automation, however, is certainly heating up. And yeah, it’s pretty new. “Mobile has been the future for 10 years now,” Adam Marchick told me today. He’s the CEO of Kahuna, a mobile marketing automation company that just raised $11 million to hit the market harder.
One dank January day in 1976, I stood on an English hillside with my mother and watched men with chain saws cutting up wrecks of trees and tossing brushwood onto fires. I was 5 years old, amazed by the roaring blades and drifting smoke, and troubled too. ‘‘Why are they burning them?’’ I asked her. Her words were a shock. I’d assumed until then that the countryside was an eternal and unchanging place. At that time, Dutch elm disease was spreading across continents, a blight had killed four billion American chestnuts, and catastrophic new tree diseases were to follow.
Scientists at Cambridge University have grown “mini-placentas” that could prevent miscarriages. The laboratory grown "organoids" used cells taken from placental tissue to examine the early stages of pregnancy. An analysis of the study showed that the new placenta model was capable of secreting the proteins and hormones that affect a mother's metabolism during pregnancy. It was even able to record a positive response when tested with a pregnancy test. Dr Margherita Turco said: "Our knowledge of this important organ is very limited because of a lack of good experimental models.

"I have lived in the U.S. for nine years. I have a green card that I received through the diversity visa lottery six years ago. I would like to apply for citizenship this year, but I’m wondering if I should just leave well enough alone and be happy enough with my green card. I started paying taxes last year. If I had to go back and re-file I would stuck owing a lot of money that right now I cannot afford. How should I handle this with regards to citizenship? And how will immigration really know that I didn’t file taxes?"

It's often said that smell is the sense most closely tied to memory. This is nonsense. Yes, a scent may on occasion provoke an emphatic, unmediated recollection, but it is typically an imprecise one--a general period in one's life rather than a particular moment. Our specific memories, by contrast, are primarily visual and auditory, not unlike a movie playing in the mind's eye. It's hardly surprising, then, that cinema has often been described as a kind of synthetic memory. As John Malkovich, playing director F.W.
In October 2015, Vermont Public Radio aired an hour-long program that took an extensive look into the life of presidential candidate (and Vermont senator) Bernie Sanders. From his school days in Brooklyn to college in Chicago to his first foray into politics and his presidential bid. But this wasn’t only a radio program. It was also a 10,700-word text piece with photos (including one of Sanders running high school track and another of him running for mayor), striking illustrations and social media storytelling. It was also translated into French and Spanish.

As experts begin their study of the long-term health effects of anti-malarial drugs on service members and others, retirees and other veterans are urging them to consider case studies and medical records. And a long-time critic of the government’s response to concerns about the anti-malarial mefloquine told the committee of experts that he has questions about the validity of the study, because of the lack of data, and “a flawed and biased base” of scientific literature now available. More importantly, he said, the Department of Veterans Affairs should be screening veterans who took mefloquine and providing treatment.
KARACHI, July 8: In this day and age when electronic and distorted music is gaining popularity there are still some that hold the traditional rock music close to their heart.

SANAA (Reuters) - Warring factions in the war in Yemen exchanged accusations on Friday of violating a 72-hour ceasefire that began just before midnight on Wednesday, with the Saudi-led coalition saying Houthi forces have breached the truce by attacking several cities in both countries. The United Nations announced the ceasefire between the parties earlier in the week. It has the possibility for extension if it holds. The Saudi-led coalition said in a statement on state news agency SPA that Iran-allied Houthi forces have used rockets, shells, and snipers to attack border cities inside Saudi Arabia in the Jizan and Nijran provinces.
PITTSBURGH — Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger missed practice again on Thursday because of an issue with his right elbow. • Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa will miss Sunday's game at Buffalo because of a bone bruise to his left foot.

Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf on Wednesday called off his visit to China, hours before his departure, as the possibility of his impeachment brewed amid crucial meetings of the country's ruling coalition, reported dpa. Musharraf was scheduled to leave for China in the afternoon to attend Friday's opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics and meet Chinese leaders, including Prime Minister Hu Jintao. "President Musharraf's visit now stands cancelled and the organizers have been informed about the development," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Sadiq said.

An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth — a life for a lab book? Scientists have been sounding alarms for years about the integrity of research in China. One recent survey estimated that 40 percent of biomedical papers by Chinese scholars were tainted by misconduct. Funding bodies there have in the past announced efforts to crack down on fraud, including clawing back money from scientists who cheat on their grants. We’ve long called for sterner treatment of science cheats, including the possibility of jail time — which, by the way, most Americans agree is appropriate.

Well — they both like the ladies! Former President Bill Clinton talked with guest host, producer Harvey Weinstein, on Piers Morgan Tonight and the topic of a fictional casting for a not-yet-written Bill Clinton biopic was discussed. Who would play Bubba? When the president couldn't brainstorm an A-list Hollywood equivalent, Harvey threw out a couple standard names: George Clooney? Brad Pitt? Bill shrugged off Brad, saying the actor was way too good looking but considered George, marveling at his greatness in The Descendants. Who would play Hillary Clinton? Meryl Streep, of course.
Hundreds of people are missing and several are feared dead after a hydropower dam under construction in southern Laos collapsed, causing flash flooding which swept away homes, state media reported on Tuesday. The disaster left more than 6,600 people homeless, the Lao News Agency reported. It showed pictures of villagers wading through muddy flood waters carrying belongings.

NEW YORK The three finalists that emerged last week in Miller Brewing Co.’s $175 million creative review—Publicis’ Saatchi & Saatchi and Publicis-backed Bartle Bogle Hegarty, both here, and WPP’s Young & Rubicam in Chicago—next week will present creative ideas on Miller Lite at the client’s U.S. headquarters in Milwaukee, sources said. The contenders emerged from an earlier field of five that also included independent New York shops Mother and Nitro. The incumbent, MDC’s Crispin Porter + Bogusky in Miami, parted ways with the client last month, triggering the review.
FOR parents, the scariest part of Halloween isn’t the ghosts, but the huge amount of sugar little ones consume. Kids can propel themselves way over their daily allowance with just a handful of ghoulish goodies. But it is possible to give kids delicious – but healthier – delights. METHOD: Mix the gingerbread ingredients together, chill, then roll out to 1in thick. Cut with a mould, put on a tray with greaseproof paper and bake for 15 minutes at 170C. Make the icing by beating an egg white until soft peaks form then add icing sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.

Gazprom is in talks with Brunei LNG about possible gas purchases as delays in Russian LNG projects have forced the Russian oil major to seek additional resources in Asia, Vedomosti daily reports. Gazprom, the holder of the world's largest gas reserves, has been struggling to kick-start LNG projects in Russia amid global financial turmoil and recent discoveries of vast unconventional gas resources in the United States. The gas from Brunei LNG could be purchased after 2013 when current contracts expire, reports Vedomosti, citing documents prepared for Gazprom's board. A Memorandum of Cooperation between Gazprom and the Government of Brunei was signed in June, reported The Brunei Times.
A disappointing first quarter by the Lady Tigers proved to be the difference in their 47-34 loss at home against Resurrection Christian Tuesday night. The visiting Cougars took advantage of numerous turnovers and a porous defense as they raced to an early 8-0 lead before Emerie Rios found the Tigers' first bucket. Senior Elisabeth Perl scored nine of her 15 points in the first quarter against Sterling via short jumpers and easy lay-ups. With the score 17-4 at the end of the first quarter, it looked like the rout was on. The Tiger defense bounced back in the second quarter, holding the Cougars to two field goals and a free throw.

The last session of the 15th Lok Sabha brings to an end one of the most disappointing periods in the short parliamentary history of India. The numbers tell part of the story: this Lok Sabha saw over 800 hours, or almost 40 percent of its scheduled time lost to disruptions; the least number of bills were passed in a full term, and some important ones without any discussion; the budget was passed last year without discussing the expenditure allocation for ministries; over 40 percent of Question Hour was lost to disruptions, implying that ministers were not held accountable for their actions.
Facebook and Google both have a Russia problem. But while Facebook has mounted a very public response to charges of election meddling on its platform, Google has kept its head down. Why it matters: At least so far, Google has managed to avoid the scale of criticism that has hit Facebook and Twitter as a result of Congress' investigation into Russia's actions and the platforms' role in allowing them, which is good news for a company that is frequently at the center of tech policy battles. Still, it will get intense questioning when its general counsel testifies on Capitol Hill next week.
Spring is just around the corner and losses due to the clostridial diseases pulpy kidney, blackleg and black disease become a definite possibility. Little can be done to treat an animal affected by these clostridial diseases. Often all that is found is an animal dead in the paddock. Therefore, the emphasis should be on prevention. The key to prevention is to ensure that cattle and sheep are adequately protected through vaccination. To be effective, vaccines need to be given strategically. Most vaccines give up to 12 months of protection and should therefore be given at least annually.
Chief Sam Somers says ten-thousand city households are now part of the Nextdoor social media network. Nextdoor allows neighbors and police a secure place to talk online or by way of smart phone about anything happening in the neighborhood. "We have the community's buy-in," says Somers. "We have to have the community support. We have to have the community involved. We have to have their eyes and ears. Because, if we don't have that, there's not enough of us to be able to police this city to make it the safest."
WATCH ABOVE: Organized by OUTSaskatoon, the city's first public two-spirit powwow took place at the University of Saskatchewan on Saturday. The Bowl at the University of Saskatchewan was filled with dancers for Saskatoon’s first two-spirit powwow on Saturday afternoon. The powwow aimed to create a safe space for all people, especially two-spirit people, a term which was coined in Winnipeg in 1990. “We made this name ‘two-spirit’ because we were different than the queer community; we were queer and Indigenous. We lived from an Indigenous worldview, which is a spirit-based worldview,” said Marjorie Beaucage, OUTSaskatoon’s two-spirit elder.
Winter in Philadelphia is unkind. It's windy, it's icy, it's (still) smelly, it's (sometimes) snowy. Still, John Allers thought it would be a good idea to host an outdoor concert in late January. As it turns out, he was right. In 2011, Radio 104.5, Philly's alternative rock station, for which Allers is the program director, unveiled what was then called Winter Jam, an open-air concert at the Piazza at Schmidts. The free event featured performers Bayside and locals Terrible Things and Valencia.

Seeing how it works: Dark spots on X-ray film in the line next to the number 16 show the specific molecules in human cells that the drug mitoglitazone acts on. Numbers at the very top have been blurred to protect proprietary information about the diabetes drug. That's what the conventional wisdom and most of the scientific literature says, yet a couple of research scientists are staking their careers and a handful of Grand Rapids investors are betting millions of dollars it will. The edge: Research scientists Jerry Colca, left, and Rolf Kletzien said they believe their treatment avoids the adverse side effects of current drugs.
He was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed fishing and camping on Lake of the Woods. He also loved gardening, visiting with his “Hydro family” and his neighbours, and was an avid dog lover.

The hackers managed to kill every character in many of the games' cities. World of Warcraft developer Blizzard Entertainment recently acknowledged that an "in-game exploit" had caused the deaths of both player characters and non-player characters in some of the game's major cities. "Imagine logging into your favorite MMO only to find that a previously populated capital city is a barren wasteland devoid of life," writes Massively's Justin Olivetti. "This actually happened yesterday to some denizens of World of Warcraft, as mischief-makers used an exploit to kill everyone -- human players and NPCs alike -- in the biggest cities.
A new Obama administration policy will give low-income high schoolers access to the federal financial aid system. Thousands of low-income high school students will be able to use federal grant money to pay for classes at local colleges, the Obama administration announced Monday. In a first-of-its-kind move, some needy students will be able to access Pell Grants early to pay for "dual-enrollment" classes at 44 public and community colleges across the country. High school students have typically been prohibited from using federal financial aid. The change is aimed at helping to close a longstanding gap between rich and poor students in college attendance and completion.

Even before the Enron scandal and the advent of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, experts have debated what makes a successful board of directors. After Sarbanes-Oxley, the push was for independent directors from diverse backgrounds. Now, in the current economic environment, similar discussions are popping up again. Board members must be independent in that they will think for themselves rather than simply rubber stamp management's ideas, but not so independent that they don't have relevant experience in the industry or as a director. Board members must have the time to carry out their responsibilities.

Dispatches from the Urban Resistance: Alameda to Elyria and beyond. The progressive left is at its best when it combines visionary politics with pragmatic action, when it makes people’s lives better in a concrete fashion. Franklin Roosevelt’s Civilian Conservation Corps began as an ambitious idea that ultimately sent millions of young people into the woods to plant trees, build trails, and restore the landscape, while providing an income for their struggling families. The “sewer socialists” of early-20th-century Milwaukee, Wisconsin, earned a reputation for coupling their ideological values with commonsense projects like improved water, electricity, and sanitation systems.

The total budget is at $222.4 million, with $44.6 million going toward the general fund.
DAVIS (AP) — A small group of University of California students have taken over a vacant building on the Davis campus. UC Davis spokeswoman Claudia Morain says the protesters entered the two-story building after a noon rally Tuesday and were still there Wednesday. Morain says the small building was recently the home of the Cross Cultural Center and will soon house some student affairs programs. Campus officials say they are monitoring the situation to ensure campus safety and minimize disruption to student services. Student Artem Rafkin told The Sacramento Bee says the protesters plan to use the building as the center of operations for the campus Occupy movement.
USA (MNN) — According to a Barna report released last month, nearly half of Christian Millennials think “it is wrong to share one’s personal beliefs with someone of a different faith in hopes that they will one day share the same faith.” In contrast, only 27 percent of Generation X, 19 percent of Boomers, and 20 percent of Elders are hesitant to talk about their faith in Jesus with non-Christians. The issue isn’t that Millennials don’t feel equipped to share their faith. Eighty-six percent of Millennials said if someone raises questions about faith, they know how to respond.
For one week in early 2015, China was riveted by a former news anchor's self-financed online documentary about air pollution. Speaking gently in the film, Chai Jing described her newborn daughter's surgery to remove a tumor, and her own sudden terror about China's polluted air. She began wearing a mask. At home, she taped the cracks in doors and windows. She kept her daughter indoors half the time, "like a prisoner." Smog is something everyone in China is accustomed to, but Ms. Chai's "Under the Dome" reminded people how personal the problem is, and how visceral.
I suppose it's possible that this is just a chyron error designed to make everyone's inner eight-year-old eject torrents of milk from their nostrils, but I suppose there's also a chance this could be real. Real as in the poor Tulsa, OK metropolitan area served by the intrepid reporters of Fox 23 is being inundated by rivers of icy mucous. Even if it is just a mistake and they meant "SNOW" instead of "SNOT" (which I doubt) that doesn't make their driving advice any less valid.
Spitzer’s program bill needs to go away like he did. A bill ratcheting up abortion strongly supported by former Gov. Eliot Spitzer is quite likely to go away with him. State legislators need to make sure that it does. The proposal is commonly referred to as the Reproductive Health & Privacy Protection Act (RHAPP). It was introduced as a governor’s program bill before Spitzer’s resigned, but remains in the Senate, where it has sat in the health committee since Jan. 9. If committee members decide not to move it, it’ll die there at the end of the session.

If pork be your passion, double-down with chops and skins for a good price. I'm sipping a drink that's creamy, mildly sacchariferous and effervescent, yet, simultaneously, so stinky in a curdled way that I have to tilt my head away from the glass, sucking through a straw to tolerate it. This is a sua hot ga — club soda enriched by condensed milk and egg yolk. If you're an adventurist, you should try it, especially in place of the "salty soda lemonade" (each $3) that's like a viscous, sour Sprite spiked with sea water.
Here's a look at some of the top boys basketball prospects in Wisconsin regardless of high school class. WISCONSIN - Jim Chones. Joe Wolf. Brian Butch. There was a time when those former high school basketball standouts were considered once-in-a-lifetime players to come out of Wisconsin. Over the past decade, the Badger State has turned into fertile recruiting ground for many of the top blue-blood basketball programs in the country. Strong showings on the AAU spring and summer circuits have forced recruiting analysts for sites such as 247Sports, Rivals and ESPN to take notice. College coaches are right there with them intently watching.

LAS VEGAS--Aiming to bolster its corporate business, Gateway on Tuesday plans to announce a new lineup of storage gear and servers running SuSE Linux.

A coroner’s court has recorded a verdict of accidental death at the inquest of Portadown man Daryl Burke who drowned on a fishing trip last year. The inquest heard that Mr Burke, a member of Portadown Pikers Angling Club, usually wore a life jacket but was not wearing one on this occasion. A coroner’s jury, sitting at the inquest in Ballaghaderreen, Co Roscommon, on Thursday recommended that in future all fishermen wear life jackets. Coroner Desmond O’Connor paid tribute to all those volunteers who had searched for 16 days to recover Mr Burke’s body.
How needy families get excluded from assistance programs. The 2006 Street Count - an annual census of homeless people in the United States - has resulted in accolades and high- fives for the Bush administration's Interagency Council on Homelessness (ICH). Rates have dropped in major metropolitan areas such as Miami and Dallas by as much as 30 percent. Some places, such as Denver, report more modest decreases. Overall though, the climate at the national summit held in Denver recently for those involved in developing 10-year plans to end homelessness was pretty ecstatic.

Since Florida&apos;s frontier days when cattlemen drove their herds through the state&apos;s vast fields and forests, ranchers and native panthers have been natural enemies. The ranchers seek to nurture and protect their calves, while the panthers see them as prey. Human development won the battle, driving the large, tawny cats to the brink of extinction before successful efforts to restore them began decades ago. But with Florida&apos;s panther population recovering, some ranchers complain the protected 6-to-7-foot long predators are once again killing their calves.
Government agencies are seeking broad new authority to ramp up killings and removals of gray wolves in the Northern Rockies and Great Lakes, despite two recent court actions that restored the animal's endangered status in every state except Alaska and Minnesota. Various proposals would gas pups in their dens, surgically sterilize adult wolves and allow "conservation" or "research" hunts to drive down the predators' numbers. Once poisoned to near-extermination in the lower 48 states, wolves made a remarkable comeback over the last two decades under protection of the Endangered Species Act.
IT DIDN'T take long for A's strength and conditioning coach Bob Alejo to take the ultimate razzing for his turf-munching performance last week in Huntsville, Ala. Alejo tried to score from first base on coach Ron Washington's double in the A's exhibition with their Double-A affiliate, but took a dramatic tumble coming around third base. "The grass came out from under me," Alejo said. "I was out by 100 feet." Less than a day passed before Alejo heard a familiar voice on the phone, giving him grief for pulling up lame with a strained hamstring: Mark McGwire.

Meet the New Boss: Rand Paul? When Scott Brown voted for the jobs bill and endorsed Mitt Romney for president, I thought it was a pretty good hint that the whole Tea Party thing was doomed to failure. It seemed even more clear this morning, when Jeff Zeleny over at the New York Times quoted Rand Paul saying that if elected, he would support Mitch McConnell's leadership in the Senate. "I don't see myself going up there and being the one fly in the ointment," he said. Of course, one of Paul's most passionate convictions is for term limits.

Philadelphia believes it has momentum on its side going into game number two of this young season, namely a contest against the Colorado Avalanche here on Saturday night. After all, everything seemed to go right in a stunningly easy 5-2 win over the Golden Knights on Thursday night at T-Mobile Arena. • Wayne Simmonds erased any doubt about his health after offseason pelvis surgery by scoring a pair of goals (giving him a total of five in the last two season openers).
This enormous mural covering a grain silo in the South Korean port city of Incheon has been listed by the Guinness World Records as the largest in the world. The colourful painting, which stands 48m tall and covers a total of 23,688 sq m, illustrates a young boy's coming-of-age story as the seasons pass, and resembles a collection of 16 book covers. According to Yonhap news agency, the Incheon city government and Incheon Port Authority commissioned 22 artists, who used more than 850,000 litres of paint, for the project that began in January and cost 550 million won (S$668,000).
As with most well-established sports and outdoor activities, the gear used in scuba diving and snorkeling continues to evolve, although at times it feels like true innovation comes at a snail’s pace. But a Chinese designer who goes by the name of ZJ-DDG unveiled a new concept design for a dive mask that has the potential to be a real game-changer, bringing a host of interesting technologies that could alter the way underwater exploration and adventure takes place. The first major change that the the D-Mask brings to the table is that it does away with traditional scuba mask design in favor of something much larger.

Concerns have been expressed by members of Northamptonshire’s Police and Crime Panel about plans to build a school on the site of the force’s headquarters in Northampton. During a meeting at County Hall on Tuesday, Adam Simmonds, the county’s police and crime commissioner, was grilled about his proposal to sell the Wootton Hall site to the Education Funding Agency (EFA) to allow a new school to be built. South Northants Councillor Lizzy Bowen said it could be more financially lucrative for the Wootton Hall land to be sold to a property developer to build houses.
MicroProfile.io, a group that has set out to improve enterprise Java for microservices deployments, plans to form its own foundation. The foundation is expected to fall under the umbrella of the Eclipse Foundation, said Rich Sharples, senior director of product management at Red Hat, which has participated in MicroProfile.io. It would provide "fair and even governance," with no single vendor dominating, and handle responsibilities like legal and technical infrastructure, as well as trademark and copyright assignment. MicroProfile.io has taken the stance that Oracle, which oversees Java, has been too dominant in Java's development.
Aside from the obvious comparisons to Air, or any other European down-tempo impresario, they wear their affection for pure pop sound producing on their parkas.

Listen to this while you're waking up, brushing your teeth, or on your way to work. It won't yell at you or make any quick, unsettling movements.
The head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, shakes hands with International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano, right, after signing an agreement in Tehran to allow inspectors broader access to Iranian nuclear sites. In the latest ratcheting up of the administration’s effort to stop Congress from adding to existing sanctions, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Americans are in a deeply antiwar mood and implied that voters might turn their anger on lawmakers if a failure of diplomacy leads to military action to prevent Iran from getting the bomb.
An Auckland eruption could force the evacuation of more than 400,000 people - but the biggest risk to life would come with a fast-rolling, bomb-like surge of hot rock and gas. That's according to a researcher who has begun a new Earthquake Commission-funded study modelling what impacts a big blow in the city-wide Auckland Volcanic Field would have on homes and businesses. "There's a huge amount of research on how volcanoes behave," Massey University's Dr Stuart Mead said. "What we want to do is use that knowledge to get a more accurate understanding of the effect of an eruption in the Auckland volcanic field.

Security company Imperva released a grim study last month suggesting that costly security suites may not be worth the price tag and that all anti-virus programs suffer from huge blind spots. Doom-and-gloom research like this always requires a hefty grain of salt, but after speaking with numerous industry experts an entire shaker might be necessary. Imperva looked at a variety of security solutions from such vendors as Kaspersky, Avast, AVG, Microsoft, and McAfee, to name a few. They pitted these sentinels against 82 randomly collected malware samples, examining how successful the security software was in detecting the rogue software.

After waiting for nearly 20 minutes last night, I gave up trying to find a match of Tiny Racers. The mode, which recreates the feeling of driving RC cars, was added to GTA Online last year. Nobody plays it anymore. Actually, nobody seems to play most GTA Online modes. It's becoming a problem. GTA Online just had its most active month ever. It is consistently one of the top-selling games on Steam, Xbox and Playstation. It is always in the top 10 of the best selling games each year. The community is huge.

There has been a lot of discussion about reparation in the news recently. It was a new idea for me, but not a new topic in the U.S. Congress. There has been a bill in Congress since 1989, but like many bills, it failed to come out of committee and died an unnoticed death. The basic premise is that even though slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment, freed slaves never really had a chance to rise in the U.S. socially, financially, politically, legally or in any other meaningful way.

Blossom Dearie, a beloved singer and pianist with a funny name and a curiously captivating voice, has died in New York at the age of 84. Dearie made her recording debut on the Verve label in 1956 with a self-titled album. Blossom Dearie set the pattern for future recordings, using a small backing band to put the emphasis on Dearie's playing and imaginative, just-inches-from-the-microphone readings. Dearie eventually took to recording for her own label, beginning in the 1970s, and continued performing, mostly in New York and London, until 2006. Stephen Holden has an appreciative, detailed obituary at The New York Times.

Like any energetic 7-year-old, your daughter loves running around outside, playing with her friends and kicking around a soccer ball. So you’re concerned when she starts losing energy. She looks pale and refuses to eat. You take her to the pediatrician, and her test results show the worst: she has leukemia. Once you work through the shock, you do you what any parent would do: find the best possible care to get her through it. But where do you go? Health care for children is different from care for adults.
Many low-means age care residents are paying more than those who are market-price payers. One of the biggest studies undertaken of superannuation underlines the extent of the gender gap. Mark McKenzie has perhaps only weeks to live. The last thing he wanted was to be on the phone almost daily to push his super fund for the early release of his super balance and life insurance. While some people want to work for as long as they can, others yearn for a life of leisure before they’re 30 – and strive like demons to get there. Taskforce simplifies the means-testing arrangements for aged care.

Daniel Radcliffe is thoroughly debunking Wolverine casting rumors that have cropped up following jokey comments he made about the role. It took a long time for a film version of X-Men to hit the big screen, and the project went through various iterations. James Cameron was once set to produce a version directed by Kathryn Bigelow in the early 1990s, which had Bob Hoskins (Super Mario Bros) lined up to play Wolverine. Russell Crowe was Bryan Singer’s first choice for Wolverine during casting on the 2000 movie, but after he turned it down, Dougray Scott was hired.
Are shorter university degrees in Ontario’s future? In a bid to transform post-secondary education in Ontario, the government is considering shorter degrees, year-round classes and making all general first- and second-year credits transferable to any university in the province. In a discussion paper to be released Thursday, those ideas are suggested as ways to keep post-secondary schooling more relevant and flexible for students, and could mean bachelor degrees in less than four years, more online learning, and the option of three full semesters a year instead of the typical two.
The Red Sox acquired Jake Peavy from the White Sox in a three-team deal Tuesday night that also sent shortstop Jose Iglesias to the Detroit Tigers. The Boston Red Sox needed a starting pitcher. The Detroit Tigers were looking for infield help. The Chicago White Sox wanted more prospects. And that’s why baseball’s biggest trade of the season came together. The slick-fielding Iglesias provides a nice insurance policy for AL Central-leading Detroit in case Jhonny Peralta is suspended as part of baseball’s Biogenesis drug investigation. Iglesias also can play second and third.

Thanksgiving will be nice for them. By Christian Petersen/Zuffa L.L.C./Getty Images. Why shouldn’t they enjoy each other’s company immensely? They’re both action stars with conservative fans and large shoulders. It’s unclear what Pratt’s political beliefs are—he’s talked about wanting to “help bridge” the gap in politics, and not feeling “represented by either side,” be it red or blue. But he’s never said publicly, “Hey, as a Republican, I believe in tax cuts for the rich,” while accepting the Teen Choice Award or something.
"I was 32-weeks pregnant with my second child when I was diagnosed with breast cancer, just over two weeks after my 35th birthday." In our “Why I’m Running” series, Boston Marathon runners share what’s inspiring them to make the 26.2-mile trek from Hopkinton to Boston on April 16, 2018. Are you running Boston? Here’s how to share your story on Boston.com. Hearing the words “You have Cancer” are not what anyone expects or wants to hear, but sadly it happens every single day.
This is way better than bread-and-butter pudding made with dried fruit; the tartness of the raspberries slices right through the richness. Bring the milk, cream and a pinch of salt to the boil in a heavy-bottomed pan then remove from the heat. Add the vanilla. Beat the eggs, yolk and sugar in a bowl. Pour the milk and cream on to this, stirring all the time. Heat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4. Butter the bread and layer it, buttered-side up, in a 2 litre (3½ pint) ovenproof dish, sprinkling on the fruit and whisky as you go.
It's been 16 years since we were first blessed with Kim Possible, our beloved redheaded high school heroine who had the catchiest theme song of all time. Kim Possible, which ran for 87 episodes on the Disney Channel and spawned two original animated movies, was a staple in the life of every early aughts kid. But here's the sitch: Kim Possible is coming back!!! Today, the Disney Channel announced that they've begun the casting process for a live-action Kim Possible movie. The original animated series creators Mark McCorkle and Robert Schooley have returned to pen the script, alongside Josh Cagan.
Washington -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office accused the news program "60 Minutes" of omitting key information from its report Sunday on how members of Congress use privileged information to profit from stock trades. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill also called the report "a right-wing smear" based on a new book by conservative author Peter Schweizer of the Hoover Institution, a think tank based at Stanford University. The book is titled: "Throw Them All Out: How Politicians and Their Friends Get Rich Off Insider Stock Tips, Land Deals, and Cronyism That Would Send the Rest of Us to Jail."
We’ve all been there. We board a plane and it’s packed to the hilt. Well, a Scottish woman who was flying to Greece had the opposite experience: She was the only passenger on the 189-seat plane. Grieve said she struggled to keep her composure because a full plane or not, the crew still had to go through the safety procedures prior to take off. “The girl stood up and was doing the whole thing and she said she had to do it, it’s a legal requirement,” Grieve said.

Apple's new Music Memos app captures musical inspiration, while GarageBand adds a new AI drummer and loop arranger. When a bolt of musical inspiration hits, many musicians will reach for their smart phones, pop open the built-in voice-recorder app, and make a quick recording of some combination of guitar, voice or piano, hoping to capture the essence of the idea before it fades. But a voice memo is a blunt tool for capturing a song idea, and the artist is left on their own to figure out how to translate a rough recording into something more substantial -- or even to remember what chords were played.
Brighton & Hove Albion have completed the signing of Almeria striker Leonardo Ulloa for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around £2m. The 26-year-old Argentine has signed a four-and-a-half year contract with the Championship club. Seagulls boss Gus Poyet told the club website: "Leo is that striker we have been looking to add for some time. "He will complement our existing strikers and enjoy playing with our wingers and creative players." Ulloa, who scored 29 goals for the Spanish second division side last season, recently obtained a Spanish passport which enables him to play in England.
The most we can absorb. Anyone who drives realizes our roads need work. Not up for debate. Any senior citizens living on Social Security and, hopefully, some pension money also realize that a 20-cent-per-­gallon gas tax increase would have a significant impact on their mobility. Not only would they see an increase in cost if they drive their own cars, but that cost would certainly be passed along in other forms of transportation such as cabs, Uber, buses, prescription deliveries, trash, recycling — any private or public gas-dependent service. We regularly read about the isolation many seniors feel because they have difficulty getting around.
1. The Warrington game was billed as Saints' biggest test to date - and what a way to pass it, with an utterly dominant forward display laying the platform for some dazzling tries. Warrington had played their part in building this game into an event - and it is what the sport needs with a 17,000 gate cramming in. But after coming in big numbers and a swagger - it was the Wolves who sheepishly crept away with their tails between their legs at the end, while the home fans turned the volume up.

My parents read to my sister and me when we were growing up. A love of reading was one of the greatest gifts they gave us. Kern’s interview reminded me of another precious gift I received a long time ago — the friendship of Frank Wolfarth Walsh, owner of the Old Town Bookstore in Saginaw, Mich. Listening to the Kerns talk about their family tradition of reading, I was propelled back to a frosty morning in early December. As I stepped inside the bookstore, the chime over the door tinkled its greeting. Frank was in his big arm chair, surrounded by books.
Justice Department probes into companies suspected of paying overseas bribes often rely on the businesses’ own internal investigations. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have taken the step because of the cost of such investigations, The Washington Post reported. Various sources report that the practice is widespread and can result in a situation where the private lawyers who have conducted the investigation later end up representing the firm in negotiations over charges and penalties. Nonetheless, the government ends up saving money and scoring an easy win and the companies get credit for cooperating, the Post reported.
Proposed increases less than previous years. Top campaign aides to assist the governor's 2020 bid. Preliminary hearings will be rescheduled. "I want to keep moving forward," Capito announces on "Talkline." Preliminary results of West Virginia Educator Voice released Wednesday. Michael Kennedy's trial date set for June 4. Barboursville police make sure Mohamed Zayan gets off safely. Delegate how "Fix Our Roads" link on website. Senator says progress made in Friday meeting. Woman claimed man tried to abduct her young daughter. Senator Capito and MaryAnn Tierney will discuss pace of school replacement projects.
Liverpool co-owner Tom Hicks has written to the club's chief executive Rick Parry calling for him to resign. Hicks is thought to feel that Parry is siding with co-owner George Gillett in the club's ongoing power struggle. The latest twist comes on the day Dubai International Capital said it will wait for the saga to be resolved before pursuing its interest in the club. BBC Sport understands Parry is highly unlikely to resign and that Hicks lacks boardroom support for his shock move. With the club ownership split 50-50 between the two Americans, Hicks would need approval from Gillett to force Parry out of his position.
Home Being Raised Partially Collapses Onto House Next Door In QueensOfficials say the two-story single-family home on Hillside Avenue in Breezy Point was being raised when it slipped around 2 p.m.
Fisherman Swept Off Breezy Point Jetty Dies, Another Man RescuedWitnesses told CBS2’s Dave Carlin two men were fishing off the jetty Saturday, even though the tide appeared to be very high and some of the rocks were barely visible. NYPD Divers Rescue Truck Caught In Breezy Point TideNYPD divers came to the rescue of a driver and his passengers in Breezy Point Sunday night.
The European Commission’s new delegation head, David Lipman. Last year, the Cambodian government requested food relief from development agencies even as it signed contracts to export significant stocks of rice to foreign governments. Should the government abstain from selling food stocks if it is simultaneously requesting food aid? The basic problem in Cambodia with food production is that they don't have a lot of storage capacity, and unless you have the storage capacity, you can't keep the food in the country. So, often, it is wiser to export because you can't stock it.
VIDEO has emerged showing protesters holding up an ambulance on its way to hospital with a patient. The ambulance was caught up in the chaos in Birmingham where Black Lives Matter protesters blocked traffic on the A45 Coventry Road. Footage showed the vehicle – with its sirens wailing – trying to muddle its way through gridlocked traffic leading up to the demonstrators’ blockade. Cars can be seen trying to move out of the way but progress appears slow as they don’t have much room to manoeuvre. After a few minutes the ambulance is able to make it as far as the picket line.
Kirby Hocutt isn’t going anywhere for a while, according to Don Williams of the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal. Arkansas reportedly reached out to Hocutt in an attempt to fill their vacant Athletic Director position, but one of Williams’ sources thinks that Hocutt is staying put. Many think of Kirby Hocutt for his baffling explanations for the bewildering activity of the College Football Playoff committee, or his loyalty to Kliff Kingsbury. Those are certainly the two most visible parts of his job, but in terms of all the other sports on campus, Hocutt’s hires have been incredible.
RUSH: The New Black Pantherette, Jemele Hill, who is recently suspended from…? (interruption) What are you lookin’ at? New. New Black Panther. She’s not a Huey Newton. Now, as I point out, she was not suspended for calling Trump a white supremacist. I don’t think ESPN Disney thought that reflected negatively on them, but this they think does. And this is about money. This is not about principle. What she did is go out and basically tell people to boycott her company!
Darnell McDonald plays a lot of center field, and when he is on base, he is always a threat to run. Speed is an important component to his game. Therefore, taking care of his legs through an arduous baseball season remains paramount. Interestingly enough, that process involves very little running. Once the season starts, McDonald does almost no speed or endurance work. He gets his legs moving while shagging flies in batting practice, warming up before games and then in the games themselves. Once the last out is made, it's time for recovery.
The Texas Forest Service this morning reported that several large fires in the region are still burning, but mostly contained. A fire in Lynn County at the T-Bar Ranch was 90 percent contained today, according to a forest service incident report released this morning. The blaze burned about 1,500 acres of grass about 20 miles south of Lubbock. There were no structures threatened. The fire in Terry County that has burned about 4,000 acres at the Spade Ranch was about 75 percent contained. The fire is burning tall grass about 43 miles southwest of Lubbock. No structures are threatened.
The very fact that Johnny Adair is still alive after 20 years at the helm of Ulster's biggest loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Defence Association, makes him a huge success within his venal, violent realm. Nobody has yet managed to murder Johnny "Mad Dog" Adair. But that, leading loyalists and nationalists in Belfast say, is probably just a matter of time. "Right now there's a queue of people waiting to kill Johnny and he knows it," a loyalist figure with links to the paramilitaries said. "The problem for Johnny is that most of them are loyalists."
MIAMI (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp said on Thursday it will not proceed with a $24 billion nuclear power project in central Florida because of licensing delays and doubts about cost recovery, but may use the site for nuclear power generation in the future. The announcement was the latest blow to nuclear power investment in the Sunshine State and reflected the boom in natural gas development nationwide. Although it is pulling the plug on plans to build a nuclear plant in Florida's Levy County, the company said it continues to regard the Gulf Coast site as a "viable option for future nuclear generation."
WASHINGTON (AP) — The presidents of the U.S. and China agreed Friday that a planned rocket launch by North Korea would violate U.N. sanctions, the White House said, amid signs the isolated nation was moving closer to blastoff. Commercial satellite imagery analyzed by U.S. researchers showed tanker trucks at the launch pad at the Sohae facility on North Korea's west coast. That is likely to fill fuel and oxidizer tanks, in preparation for what North Korea says is the launch of an Earth observation satellite but which the U.S. calls a ballistic missile test.
Washington D.C., Oct 12, 2016 / 05:26 pm ().- In the closing weeks of the Jubilee Year of Mercy, Catholics should pray and fast for “a culture of life,” one Catholic member of Congress has said. “Like in the time of Queen Esther, the faithful and faith-filled need to pray and fast for God’s mercy, healing, justice, humane laws and policies and conversion. An outpouring of the Holy Spirit,” Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), co-chair of the Bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, told pilgrims on the International Day of Prayer and Fasting on Monday.
Sachithra Senanayake struck a six off the penultimate ball to give Sri Lanka a two-wicket triumph over South Africa on Sunday in the final match of an international series, won 3-2 by the hosts. AB de Villiers and Graeme Smith got 125 each as South Africa made 312-4, but a century from Kumar Sangakkara led the tourists to 314-8 and a second win within three days. Set a target of 313 to win, Sri Lanka seemed in control towards the end until they lost three wickets off four balls and suddenly the Proteas looked like they could finish off the match.
Is Incentive Compensation a True Motivator? I write about compensation governance. “Pay for performance” – the concept that executives’ compensation should be commensurate with the value they deliver to shareholders – has become a household phrase in recent years. The popular understanding of its meaning reflects the longstanding belief in corporate America that financial incentives are the most powerful motivator of executive performance. Yet the findings of various studies by behavioral psychologists suggest otherwise. These findings have profound implications for companies large and small, for they raise questions about the motivational rationale underlying incentive compensation programs.
Stricken townspeople swept away the wreckage of a fuel truck bomb that killed 98 persons in south of Baghdad as three more suicide car bombers struck the Iraqi capital today in a relentless new campaign. Seventeen foreign militants of the Al-Qaeda terror network have been killed in a gunbattle with security forces, who arrested 16 of their local collaborators in the North Waziristan tribal belt of Pakistan, the army said today. The British police has released a chilling photograph of the four young men who bombed London last week which shows them trudging into a train station on the morning they detonated their explosives.

Iggy Pop will headline London’s Royal Albert Hall with new bandmates Josh Homme and Matt Helders in May. As reported, Pop’s new album ‘Post Pop Depression’ is scheduled for release on March 18 and was recorded in secret last year. His band for the album was made up of Homme (who also produced the album), Arctic Monkeys‘ drummer Matt Helders and Homme’s Queens of the Stone Age colleague Dean Fertita. The first UK venue to host the band will be the Royal Albert Hall in London with the band set to play on May 13.
ARSENAL boss Unai Emery has revealed he met with Arsene Wenger after replacing him during the summer. The Spaniard took charge at the Emirates following Wenger’s decision to step down after 22 years at the helm. Emery has been tasked with returning Arsenal to the top four following a disappointing campaign last term that saw them miss out on Champions League football for the second season running. The Gunners have started the season strongly and are currently enjoying an unbeaten run of 16 matches in all competitions. Emery’s side find themselves fifth in the Premier League table, just three points off the top four.
The federal government and Abia State yesterday penned the N500 billion Enyimba Economic City project at Aba, Abia State, where the federal government has taken 20 per cent equity of N100 billion. The project is a private sector driven. Regarded as project capable of sparking industrial revolution in Nigeria, the Enyimba Economic City is a 9, 803 hectares of new economic city, spanning three local government areas of Ukwa East, Ukwa West and Ugwunagbo. It is located at the centre of the five South-east and four South-south states and is to be designed to drive massive economic expansion of the region and by extension Nigeria.
With labor problems coming to a head at Walgreen Co.'s Chicago-area pharmacies, rival drug-dispenser Jewel-Osco is not being shy about luring patrons inconvenienced by a strike. The Albertson's Inc. unit said Wednesday that it plans to run print advertisements starting Thursday, with contact information for its 24-hour pharmacies. "This is a special ad," said Lauri Sanders, a spokeswoman for the Boise, Idaho-based grocer. The company has more than 200 Osco drugstores in the Chicago area, of which 28 operate around-the-clock. "We normally would not run an ad with addresses and phone numbers."
On August 20, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced its weekly main refinancing operation (MRO). The operation was conducted on August 21 and attracted bids from euro area eligible counterparties of €2.79 billion, €0.05 billion higher than the bid amount of the previous week. The amount was allotted in full at a fixed rate equivalent to the prevailing MRO rate of 0.00 per cent, in accordance with current ECB policy. On August 22, the ECB conducted a seven-day US dollar funding operation through collateralised lending in conjunction with the US Federal Reserve.
What disturbs me most about Statesman’s PR push to pass their urban-style resort is the cynical way they seek to divide the Brinnon community. Their PR materials paint a picture of a bleak and depressed Brinnon with no alternative but to throw our lot in with a Canadian developer and hope the benefits trickle down. Are we that gullible and desperate? Apparently. The Board of County Commissioners and the Department of Community Development are willing to let this developer come up with one overblown proposal after another with no financial assurances that we won’t foot the bill for their mistakes.
Forget tin cans and strings. These days, kids can call each other with their voice-activated wristphones. The gadget is called the Tinitell. The Swedish team behind it calls it the “world's smallest wearable phone designed for kids” and has raised $104,829 for it on Kickstarter — beating its $100,000 goal with 21 days to go. Kids can make a phone call by simply pressing down the big button in the middle and calling out a name, like "Dad.” Tinitell can also accept phone calls and forward calls to smartphones outfitted with a special app.
The country's biggest Maori tribe - Northland's Ngapuhi - turned up in force for their annual festival in Kaikohe at the weekend. The two-day event, launched last year, showcased the tribe's musicians, artists and speakers, with aim of celebrating Ngapuhi culture and attracting home many from outside tribal boundaries. Ngapuhi is the country's most populous iwi, with more than 100,000 members. Over 60 per cent live outside the region. Event organiser Diana Heka was overwhelmed by the support for the event, which attracted iwi members from around the country, and from Australia. About 12,000 attended.
A Cape Coral man crashed his vehicle into a home on the 100 block of Eldorado Parkway West Sunday morning, the Cape Coral Police Department said. The driver Jeffrey Simpson, 39, had a blood-alcohol level of .15 when the crash took place around 6:45 a.m., deputies said. Simpson was speeding on Eldorado Parkway and was forced to drive into a driveway when the road ended. The collision damaged a parked car outside of the structure and the garage, deputies said. The impact from the crash also caused a large tool chest to fall onto and damage an antique Corvette being stored inside.

Tweet I’ve listened to more music in 2010 than ever. I’ve heard some really good music too. I’ve liked a lot of what I’ve heard. I’m constantly being sent new music to review so a lot of times I only get to listen to an album once or twice and even if I like it, I have to move on to the next. Listening to music is a lot more work than I thought it’d be, however, when I go on a long road trip I still like to listen to music for pleasure.
The latest oral survey conducted by the Health Ministry has revealed that there is a marked improvement in the dental health of Sri Lankan children, Health Ministry sources said. The 2015/2016 National Oral Health Survey reveals that the percentage of tooth decay in children below the age of six has gone down to 63.1 percent from 65.5 percent in 2002. The percentage of tooth decay in children below 15 has gone down to 30 percent from 39.2 percent in 2002. The percentage of children below the age of 12 with healthy gums has risen to 55.3 percent from 27.2 in 2002, the sources said.
Hashim Amla struck an unbeaten 56 to guide South Africa to a comprehensive eight-wicket victory over champions Sri Lanka in a low-scoring World T20 dead rubber in Delhi. With both teams out of contention for a place in the semi-finals, the Group One match was of no real consequence and South Africa's second win in four matches helped them finish third in the group. Sri Lanka, who lost for the third time in four games, finished level on points with Afghanistan. The top two, West Indies and England, qualified for the last four, where they'll play hosts India and New Zealand respectively.
President Trump has sought to downplay doubts about the denuclearization process with North Korea. On Monday, he said he remains confident that North Korea’s Kim Jong-un will honor his commitment to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. Questions about the process began growing over the weekend, when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s visit to North Korea ended. It was followed by North Korea’s Foreign Ministry issuing a statement criticizing Pompeo for “gangster-like” demands. This raised a lot of quick speculation that this marked the beginning of the end for the peace process.
Microsoft is developing a Web-based entertainment service that will offer US regional information on restaurants, movies and local events. Microsoft is developing a Web-based entertainment service that will offer regional information on restaurants, movies and local events, according to a company official. The project, code-named Cityscape, will make its debut in January with a few US cities, according to Gayle Troberman, public relations manager for Cityscape. Microsoft will also consider expanding the service outside of the US, she says. The service will combine national and locally produced content, Troberman says.
In the last year, thousands of people have flocked to North Dakota to protest a pipeline they claim could contaminate water. But they’ve left behind enough detritus that they’ve risked causing an environmental disaster for the Missouri River, North Dakota’s governor said in a statement this week. The state has seen record snowfall this year, which has buried huge amounts of trash, camping materials and even vehicles abandoned by protestors. Though as many as 10,000 people have participated in the protests, many of them coming to North Dakota from out of state, few remained to help with the mess.

Mark Rabkin VP of Core Ads at Facebook revealed a few tips and tricks for advertising in the mobile era. Rabkin pointed out that a mobile phone should not be classified as a tiny TV, just as TV wasn’t visual radio and radio wasn’t an audible newspaper. The company suggests that mobile must be recognized for what it is: a new medium that demands new content grounded in experiences that are native to the platform like speed, choice and relevance. Facebook tracked the activity of 537 people who said they watched the season premiere of a popular TV show.
WadjetEye Games is back, this time in collaboration with indie developer Technocrat, for a futuristic point-and-click adventure that aims to deliver just as strong an experience as the fantastic Blackwell games. Cubed3 was lucky enough to get an early taste of this Spring 2015 release, so get plugged in and find out why this is already turning into something very special indeed. The beauty of the Blackwell series was that its puzzles were inventive and really got the old grey matter working, yet never put players in that uncomfortable position of having to go through every permutation of item-person-scenery to find solutions.
The first protest has been filed against CACI International’s almost $200 million capture of the main Transportation Security Administration contract for IT infrastructure services. Known as "IMPACT," this is the third iteration of the contract that first went to Unisys Corp. in 2002 when TSA was created. The second contract, known as the IT Infrastructure Program or ITIP, was then won by Computer Sciences Corp. Unisys protested the ITIP award over several rounds before CSC prevailed and then took over the work in 2010. CSC's federal business spun out in 2015 to help form CSRA, which was acquired by General Dynamics in April.
Erik Prince, founder of the notorious private military firm Blackwater, struggled to explain his apparent anti-Muslim sentiment when confronted by Al Jazeera host Mehdi Hasan. During his Head to Head talk show, Hasan asked Prince why he called people in Iraq “chanting barbarians American troops had been sent to liberate” in his memoir. Prince explained that people who set off car bombs in packed squares to hurt American troops deserve the name, especially given that civilians are also hurt. Hasan immediately called him out: “You were not sent to liberate terrorists.
Are stoners now a target advertising demographic for fast food companies? Ever since Harold and Kumar went to White Castle, fast-food companies have become increasingly blatant about targeting to stoners in their advertisements. July 31, 2012, 1:48 a.m. Between Taco Bell's "Fourthmeal" advertisements and Jack in the Box commercials featuring slow-talking stoners, it's hardly a secret anymore that fast-food companies are shamelessly targeting potheads with their ads. But have they crossed a line? Once considered a taboo marketing approach, the fast-food industry today appears to have brazenly embraced the late-night munchies, according to The Fix.
The tricks and treats of the holiday create hazards for your four-legged friends. Just because one Halloween blends into another for you doesn’t mean your pet takes it in stride. Pets are used to routine, and noisy doorbell-ringing, costume-wearing strangers arriving at your door is unsettling for your dog, cat or other pet. Consider these seven tips from Levy and other animal experts to keep your pets safe and happy during the trick-or-treat season. Doorbells, loud voices and other sounds can cause a pet to panic and even bolt out of a house.
Diplomatic cables, the paper lifeline between the State Department and its far-flung embassies around the world, may soon become artifacts for the archives. The department has quietly embarked on a $131 million project to link 250 missions overseas to Washington by computer. The system will allow department and embassy personnel to send messages and reports back and forth electronically and will allow key personnel here and abroad to tap into the department's information bank in Washington. Embassy officials now communicate with their bosses at Foggy Bottom mainly by teleprinter, often an inefficient process.

RUSH: We’re gonna start in Park Ridge, Illinois, with Jerry. Welcome, sir. Great to have you with us. CALLER: Hey, Rush. Longtime listener. How are you? RUSH: Glad to have you here. CALLER: I told Snerdley that I think the answer to this whole DREAMer deal is to build the wall. I watched the president on TV yesterday, and he made it perfectly clear that there’s gonna be no further discussion about chain migration, anchor babies, DREAMers, until Congress agrees to build the wall.
Federal health officials have approved a meningitis vaccine previously unavailable in the United States to contain an outbreak at Princeton University. Bexsero, a vaccine approved in Australia and Europe, fights off strain B of the disease. Several students at Princeton have been diagnosed with the strain, which is typically uncommon in the U.S., Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Reuters. The Food and Drug Administration agreed to expedite Bexsero’s approval in order to offer it as an optional vaccine to students on campus.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Kobe Bryant scored a season-high 21 points and the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Charlotte Bobcats 88-85 for their first win since Bryant returned from a torn Achilles tendon four games ago.

Pau Gasol and Jordan Hill had 15 points apiece for the Lakers and Nick Young had 13 points off the bench. Kemba Walker had 24 points and eight assists for the slumping Bobcats, who have lost three straight games and five of their last seven.
File photo of inmates at Maricopa County's Tent City Jail in Phoenix. Steven Jessie Harris has been incarcerated in the Clay County Jail in West Point, Mississippi, for over a decade without a trial, The Clarion-Ledger reports, and the case appears to be in violation of a major Supreme Court ruling. In 2005, Harris fatally shot his father before embarking on a violent spree, according to West Point police. He was arrested and faces several charges, including murder, kidnapping, and three counts of aggravated assault on law enforcement.
Joe Wilde lived up to his name in a frenzied try-scoring spree as Horsham thrashed Heathfield & Waldron to consolidate second place on Saturday. Fresh from kicking duties last week, the Green and Whites man crashed five tries in their 68-17 London 2 South East victory. Debutant Sam Hampson, Nick Bell, Aaron Linfield, Johnny Ordidge and Jonny Whiting all joined in the act, while Tom Johnson slotted nine conversions in a comprehensive display. Having five usual starters missing did not deter the home side as the opened up a lead over third-placed Charlton Park, who could only manage a narrow 17-16 win at Thanet Wanderers.
Canberra Data Centres (CDC) is building a new facility in Sydney with the ability to reach 120MW in capacity. CDC chief executive Greg Boorer has revealed that CDC will have the first 15MW online in May. He said the company is making a "significant investment" in Sydney as it currently builds its first facility to be located outside of the Australian Territory Capital (ACT). The facility itself isn't new, CDC acquired what it used to be a Hewlett-Packard centre in Aurora, in Eastern Creak, on 15 hectares of land.
District governors are finding themselves on the receiving end of blackmail attempts by individuals allegedly impersonating Interior Ministry and Anti-corruption Unit (ACU) officials, according to a letter issued by Ministry of Interior secretary of state Sak Setha. Setha’s letter explained that the district governors of Kampong Chhnang’s Cholkiri district and Battambang’s Roka Kiri district were blackmailed on March 4 and March 12, respectively. Setha detailed how extortionists “used the names of senior officials” to demand cash from the governors in return for a guarantee they wouldn’t be fired or jailed.
How does Apple fit into digital education? Apple(s AAPL) sent invitations on Wednesday to an event in New York City next Thursday, in which the company is planning to make “an education announcement.” “Education,” of course, can mean a lot of things. Many are connecting the event with comments Steve Jobs made to his biographer about a project he was working on toward the end of his life, and expecting that the company is going to announce some sort of digital textbook initiative through its iBookstore platform.
A GESTURE MADE by Taoiseach Enda Kenny during yesterday’s Dáil debate on the Budget has come under scrutiny today. Kenny was filmed making what appears to be a punching gesture with his hands as Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald was delivering her response to the budget measures. Well now; Glad I was not the only one to considered Enda Kenny's palm punching to have been inappropriate during Mary Lou's presentation. The Taoiseach was paying close attention to the deputy’s speech as he had to all Budget speeches given yesterday. Analysing a four second video for meaning that doesn’t exist is pointless.
Renewable energy doesn't just slow climate change, it saves water too — lots of it. April 11, 2015, 9:26 a.m.
As California struggles with the specter of ongoing drought, much has been written about water conservation. From clever ways to conserve water at home to the urgent need to tackle pot's environmental footprint, there are so many places that we need to adjust our collective behavior and reduce our water footprint. Coal plants, like most other steam-producing electricity-generating plants, typically withdraw and consume water from nearby water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, or oceans, to create steam for turning their turbines.
Steel, coal stocks, Cliffs Natural Resources, Vale and Rio Tinto are among the cheapest good buys. NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- The S&P 500 has gained 2.9% so far in October, while the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (XME surged 6.0%, outperforming the broader markets. Metals and mining stocks will likely provide attractive returns to investors, given the current positive momentum in the equity markets. The following 10 metals and mining stocks are trading at deep discounts in comparison to the broader equity markets and peer stocks, offering bargain opportunities to investors.
For those who haven’t met me in real life and those who haven’t read the blurb at the end of this blog, let me tell you a not-so-secret secret. I’m a huge fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Not just the “has merchandise, owns the whole show, owns the whole soundtrack, owns the whole manga” type of fan. I’m also the “goes to anime conventions to give talks about what it all means” sort of fan. And for lack of a better topic, I’m going to use that presentation’s content for this week.
MANCHESTER UNITED'S main focus will be on the Champions League with new hopes that Barcelona could be without Luis Suarez. Follow all the latest news and transfer gossip right here with David De Gea's new deal close to completion while Inter Milan want £68m for outcast Mauro Icardi. RYAN GIGGS hit back at Zlatan Ibrahimovic's claim that the “circle of Sir Alex Ferguson” is holding Manchester United back. Ex-Red Devils forward Ibrahimovic said this week the Class of '92 were “complaining all the time” and it had not helped recent managers at Old Trafford.
Muslims are killing Buddhist monks there. That is brutal. What kind of people would kill Buddhist monks? These Muslims should be rounded up and sent to Saudi Arabia. Do you think all Buddhists are monks? @banasy – Not all Buddhists are monks. But chrissy and banasy are Islamists for sure (actually the same person). It is not nice at all - 911 attacks on innocent people by Muslims. London subway bombings by Muslims. Bombings in Spain by Muslims. Killing of innocent people in Mumbai by Muslims. Shooting of innocent people in France by Muslim Merah.
The recent mumps outbreaks are making doctors recommend some people receive a third dose of the vaccination. If you think you're immune to the mumps because of the vaccinations you received as a child, think again. The mumps has made its way back to Delaware — and can still infect those who are immunized, doctors say. This is the first time in at least a decade that Delaware has experienced an outbreak of this kind. Eleven people, including a 1-year-old child, have been confirmed as having the illness as of Monday morning, though health officials believe this number is likely higher.
SEVENTEEN point four million people voted for Brexit. But one man thinks his vote matters more than all of them put together. In Parliament yesterday, the Speaker of the House of Commons didn’t just declare war on the Government — but on Brexit. John Bercow may have cited voluminous constitutional precedents in saying that the Prime Minister could not bring back her deal to Parliament for a third time without substantive changes. But this is the same man who drove a coach and horses through the same precedents just weeks ago in order to further the Remain cause.
WALNUT COVE, N.C. — The driver of a pickup truck involved in a fatal crash last week in Stokes County was charged Friday in connection with his role in the incident, authorities said. Justin Watkins, 24, who lives in the Lawsonville community in northern Stokes County, was charged with two counts of felony death by motor vehicle, said Trooper Ronnie Baker of the N.C. Highway Patrol. Watkins was driving a 1989 Chevrolet pickup that crossed the center lane in the 3700 block of N.C. 89 in Walnut Cove shortly before midnight and struck a car carrying three people on September 14.
Police and protesters have clashed in Algeria as marches against the ruling elite show no sign of ending. Police used water cannon and tear gas in the capital Algiers as demonstrators called for the removal of new interim President Abdelkader Bensalah. Largely peaceful protests have been held every Friday in cities across Algeria for the past two months. Police arrested 108 "infiltrators" towards end of the march after 27 officers were injured, officials say. Former leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned last week. He was replaced by Mr Bensalah, who has pledged to hold free elections on 4 July but many see him as too close to the former president.
To say Ryan Nugent-Hopkins has rediscovered his scoring mojo is a massive understatement. He got his third and fourth goals in nine games Thursday in the Edmonton Oilers bang-for-the-buck 5-4 win over the Dallas Stars after taking 26 games last season to hit four, scoring No. 4 on Dec. 3 against Anaheim. Almost two full months to get to four. On a team heavily invested in Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and Patrick Maroon on the No. 1 line, the Oilers badly need some secondary scoring help and RNH looks more like the early years RNH when things came so easily around the net.
Canadians are less satisfied with their investment firms following a year of negative yields, according to a report from J.D. Power released on Monday. The J.D. Power 2019 Canada Full Service Investor Satisfaction Study saw customer satisfaction with investment firms drop for the first time since the financial crisis of 2008, falling to 778 (on a 1,000-point scale) in 2019 compared to 785 in 2018. The report found that almost one-third (32%) of investors said their advisors didn’t take the time to explain their portfolio performance during the past year. According to J.D.
Sussex Police are looking colourful just in time for Brighton Pride tomorrow (Saturday, August 1). More than 160,000 people are expected to attend the largest event of its kind in Brighton this weekend. Now in its 25th year, organisers will mark the milestone anniversary with the parade theme ‘carnival of diversity’. Sussex Police have tweeted pictures of their vehicles painted in rainbow colours for the big occasion. The police have been a reoccurring presence in the parade for many years to show their support for the lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender (LGBT) community.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke recently said the recession is probably over, as third-quarter growth in gross domestic product will likely be positive. But as jobs are a “lagging indicator” of economic cycles — employers don’t hire until they get signals that times are good — unemployment may still go above 10 percent. For those out of work, statistics pointing to recovery are often cold comfort. Unfortunately, some of the “cures” offered by politicians also offer little comfort in reducing unemployment. In fact, they will likely make things worse.
Aug. 9, 2011 -- Executive Editor George Chamberlin speaks with Mark Riedy, executive director for the Burnham-Moores Center for Real Estate at the University of San Diego, about how economic uncertainty is affecting various markets, the downgrading of U.S. debt -- as well as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and more.

It's never too late to solve a mystery, or to set the record straight. In the 70 years since the attack on Pearl Harbor, a dramatic photo of female firefighters has been published many times in magazines, history books and online as a depiction of action on Dec. 7, 1941. We published it this past week on msnbc.com. Now, with the help of our readers, we've located one of the women, who says the photo was definitely not taken on that day. The photo as distributed by Getty Images.
Avengers: Infinity War brought about the destruction of Marvel's beloved superhero team. With Thanos looming large and half the Avengers turned to dust, anticipation for Avengers: Endgame has reached fever pitch. Will Iron Man, Captain America and the remaining crew be able to put a stop to the Mad Titan? Can they bring back Spider-Man, Black Panther and Doctor Strange? Disney and Marvel have kept remarkably quiet on the upcoming sequel, but small details have emerged thanks to trailers, chatty actors and the occasional leaked set photo. Here’s everything we know about the fourth Avengers movie.
Podcast: Quick! Who's The President of Ubeki-beki-beki-stan? "What'd you say your name was again?" The Turkmen and Uzbek presidents, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov (left) and Islam Karimov, press the flesh in Tashkent. Pronunciation was on The Blender's mind this week as U.S. presidential hopeful Herman Cain came face to face with a country whose name -- Uzbekistan -- he couldn't say and whose president -- Islam Karimov -- he couldn't remember. We here at The Blender know all too well the challenges of pronouncing names like Mahmud Ahmadinejad and Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, as we make clear with a first-ever Blender blooper reel.
Scholar Judith May Fathallah's work blurs lines between author and ethnographer, fan experiences and genre TV storytelling. In Fanfiction and the Author: How Fanfic Changes Popular Culture Texts, author Judith May Fathallah investigates the progressive intersections between popular culture and fan studies, expanding scholarly discourse concerning how contemporary blurred lines between texts and audiences result in evolving mediated practices. Fanfiction and the Author represents the latest addition to the Transmedia: Participatory Culture and Media Convergence series from Amsterdam University Press. As the title suggests, Fathallah analyses fan communities and their traversing patterns online.
NORTH CAROLINA, United States: Storm Florence weakened on Sunday (Sep 16) as it swept through the Carolinas but dozens of communities are devastated and "epic" amounts of rain could still fall, officials said. The storm was downgraded to a Tropical Depression about 5am as it trudged inland early Sunday, knocking out power and causing at least eight deaths as flood waters kept rising. "This is still a catastrophic, life threatening storm," said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Center's Weather Prediction Center.
In the wake of the recent attack on a shrine in Pakistan which claimed more than 70 lives, the conference will also have deliberations against religious fanaticism. Spiritual heads of various shrines and religious leaders from across the country will converge at the first ‘peace conference’ organised by Khwaja Moinuddin Hasan Chisty educational and charitable trust in Ajmer on March 5.

Nelson Mandela is in critical condition tonight. Perhaps the world’s greatest hero… he built his historic legacy while still in prison. He refused to leave Robben Island until white-ruled South African legalized the African National Congress. When it did, we knew the world was changing down there, that getting majority rule was just a matter of time. I was there when the first election was held - when Mandela was elected president of South Africa. It was a glorious day of people waiting in line for hours so they could be part of the great change coming over that country, a change Nelson Mandela made possible.
YouTube star Shane Dawson announced on Twitter that he is engaged to his boyfriend Ryland Adams, also of YouTube fame. Dawson popped the question on Tuesday during the pair's three-year anniversary of their first date. "HE SAID YES!!!!!!"

THANK U GUYS FOR ALL THE LOVE MY HEART IS LITERALLY GONNA EXPLODE," he later tweeted.
Stay or go on Jupiter? Investors in Jupiter funds are being bombarded with conflicting advice from their independent financial advisers on whether to sell or hold investments after recent events at the firm. The concerns surround two high-level departures from the firm. William Littlewood, manager of the £1.6bn Jupiter Income fund, retired with ill-health in April. He has been replaced by Tony Nutt. Last month chief executive John Duffield quit the company, reportedly after a row with Jupiter's ultimate parent, German bank Commerzbank, over future plans for the company and executive pay.

If you are one of the new age of entrepreneurs who hates the thought of doing a business plan as a first step in starting your new venture you will love this message. More and more professionals agree that a better strategy is to explore and fine tune your assumptions before declaring a specific plan with financial projections based only on your dream and passion. In the process, you may save yourself considerable re-work and money, or even decide that your dream needs more time to mature, before you commit your limited resources, or sign up with investors to a painful and unsatisfying plan.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — From third to fifth grade, Alyson Hochstedler says bullies slammed her son into lockers and punched him. One threatened to stab him. The public school's administration did little to stop his tormentors, she says, so the mother of five transferred her son to private school, using a state grant for low- and middle-income families to pay his tuition. The Florida Legislature is considering a proposal that would give parents like Hochstedler a second, more controversial option, especially if they aren't eligible for an income-based grant.
A recent Pioneer Press editorial on airline competition (“Raising and alarm about unfair airline competition”) failed to properly explain the current Open Skies dispute, missing many of the benefits our Open Skies agreements bring to Minnesota. Open Skies agreements are treaties between the United States and other countries to create open, competitive markets for international air travel. Delta claims it wants agreements with specific partners “enforced,” but their actions don’t match their rhetoric. First, Delta has not gone through the established Department of Transportation process to address their complaint.
Incumbent Mitch Mashburn and Nolan Sullivan on Wednesday retained their vote-count leads for two seats on the Vacaville City Council, with the two men saying they look forward to working with the apparent winner of the city’s mayoral race, Councilman Ron Rowlett. He said he has known Rowlett for a half-dozen years and was familiar with the mayor-elect’s experience in the building trades. Sullivan on Tuesday said finding solutions to building affordable housing for young couples is among his top priorities and hopes to “tap into” Rowlett’s construction experience.
A new documentary by Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera claims the 1988 Lockerbie bombing was the work of Iran, following the shooting-down of an Iran Air flight six months earlier by a US Navy warship. A missile fired by the USS Vincennes brought down Iran Air Flight 655 in July 1988, leading to deaths of 290 passengers and crew. The programme, Lockerbie: What Really Happened? features an interview with former CIA agent Robert Baer, who states that CIA colleagues "to a man" told him that Iran was behind the Lockerbie bombing.
Gavin McInnes is selling a marketable product. The pose of the right-wing provocateur and founder of the group the Proud Boys is that he’s simply a defender of normality and old-fashioned male fellowship, when what gives his cause its frisson of excitement is violence. McInnes is enjoying a media moment. After he gave a speech at New York’s Metropolitan Republican Club, a usually staid establishment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, his Proud Boys fought with members of antifa on the streets, in what has been a publicity coup. The group got denounced by New York Gov.
The blue sky seemed to vanish in an instant, as wild, grey thunderclouds raced across the mountains. Rays of sunlight broke through in places, brightening spots in the forest like searchlights. There are few landscapes more dramatic than Yakushima, and few places with more weather; within seconds we were being pelted by our 12th rainstorm of the day. But none of this bothered Sachito Fujimoto, one of Honda's top engineers. "It's the perfect climate for us," he said with a grin, and we climbed into the dumpy little blue car he was testing.
BARCELONA have reportedly compiled a European striker shortlist to replace Luis Suarez at the Nou Camp. The Uruguayan forward, 31, is nearing the end of his illustrious career and will likely be moved on by Barcelona in the coming years. The Catalan outfit have a wealth of talent at their disposal in attack, with players such as Malcom, Ousmane Dembele and Munir all struggling to break into the first-team on a regular basis. But according to Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona will look to bring in a younger model to replace Suarez when they decide he's no longer at the top of his game.

A decade later, undetonated explosives left by Israel after the 2006 war are still killing Lebanese civilians. Beirut, Lebanon - Hassan Bzieh was just a toddler when an Israeli soldier fired the rocket that, nine years later, would tear through him. For years, the cluster bomblet had not detonated, until one March day when Hassan, his twin brother and several of their cousins came across it on the way home from a swim. The delayed blast sent all of them to the hospital, where Hassan's parents waited as teams of medics fought to keep the kids alive.
Newark Symphony Hall last month completed $1.5 million in roof repairs and safety upgrades that made the 84-year-old deteriorating building on Broad Street habitable as a rental facility. But the work falls far short of a more significant investment needed to address years of neglect and return the building that once hosted such artistic greats as Marian Anderson and George Gershwin to its former stature. To rebuild Symphony Hall, its nonprofit operators will launch a $40 million capital campaign by next spring to generate public and private philanthropy for the needed renovations, which include new stage lighting; sound, heating and air-conditioning expansions; and other infrastructure improvements.
At age 94, with an extensive collection of health policy research and publications under his belt, Victor Fuchs has a lot to say about the health care system. The high cost. The uninsured. The fragmentation. During a speech at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR), the pioneering health economist narrowed his gaze to whether a single-payer system is the fix to those problems. The answer is complicated, and it depends on the questions behind the question, said Fuchs, a SIEPR Senior Fellow and the Henry J. Kaiser, Jr., Professor of Economics and Health Research and Policy, emeritus.
Despite a relatively small amount of precipitation falling recently, the most recent U.S. Drought Monitor map indicates that nearly all of Colorado is currently experiencing some level of drought. Trees in urban and community settings throughout this region are dormant now, but still require occasional watering during dry winters to remain in top health. Keith Wood, urban and community forestry manager for the Colorado State Forest Service, says planted trees in Colorado, especially at lower elevations, often require additional watering in the winter months during extended dry periods (e.g., more than two weeks without lasting snow cover).
Freshman U.S. Rep. Mark DeSaulnier has recently completed chemotherapy to treat a common form of incurable leukemia, he said Thursday afternoon. The Concord Democrat, who represents Richmond and Walnut Creek in the Bay Area, said he will seek a second term in Congress. DeSaulnier was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia last July, he told The Times in a phone interview. He referred to it as a chronic disorder that cannot be completely cured, but can be managed like diabetes. “I’m lucky that I have something that has an 85% survival rate,” he said.
FICTION/The Spare Room By Helen Garner Canongate, 195pp. £12.99:HELEN GARNER ONCE lighted on this sentence from Thackeray's Vanity Fair:"In a carriage sat a discontented woman in a green mantle"; she dislikes the knowingness of the omniscient narrator. So, it is not surprising The Spare Roomis written as a personal record; first-person narrated and, perhaps because she is also a journalist, her subject is current and disputatious. She is a veteran and a survivor of genre-bending commotion, and this new, compact novel after a 15-year gap shows she is still up for treading the boundaries between fiction and opinion pieces.

ATLANTA (AP) — Florida joins four other states in a week-long speed enforcement operation beginning Monday. "Operation Southern Shield" will run through Sunday, July 22. Law enforcement in Georgia and Alabama will join Florida, Tennessee and South Carolina in pulling over drivers who are traveling above legal speed limits on interstates, major highways and local roads. Col. Mark W. McDonough, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Safety, says the main focus will be to encourage motorists to slow down. He says they hope the effort will reduce crashes and provide a safer experience for motorists.
Three people, arrested in connection with the suspected murder of seven-year-old Blake Fowler in 2011, have been released on bail until 27 May. Two men, aged 24 and 25, were held on suspicion of murder, and causing or allowing the death of a child, and a 28-year-old woman for causing or allowing the death of a child. They were arrested at addresses in Southampton on Tuesday (1 April). The arrests follow a review and reinvestigation of the circumstances leading to the death of the child, following an incident at an address in Cromarty Road, Southampton.
The talk show queen likens book adaptation to "The Color Purple"
Oprah Winfrey, along with Tyler Perry, endorsed "Precious," due in theaters in November. Oprah Winfrey was so taken by Sapphire's novel "Push" that she read it more than once. Yet even though the talk show host has made best-sellers of unknown books, Winfrey didn't think even her staggering influence could make "Push" — the story of an obese, illiterate black teen who suffers unspeakable abuse — something that millions would want to read.

Like-colored walls, fixtures, accessories and storage containers blend for a space-enlarging effect. Every inch counts in a small bathroom with no vanity. A pedestal sink or floating-shelf-style sink may be a good-looking space saver, but it lacks storage for bathroom necessities, from tissue to toiletries. You don't need vanity storage with shelf, bin, hanging basket and built-ins that you can make. You have plenty of storage space under a pedestal sink when you enclose this area with fabric panels. Hem two panels to size, so that they hang from just under the sink to the floor, meeting in the front for easy access.
Homes historical associated with two famous Tennesseans are found in the Dale Hollow area. The excellent water quality of Dale Hollow Lake is important to the operation of the Dale Hollow National Fish Hatchery located just below Dale Hollow Dam. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service operates the hatchery on 40 acres of land leased from the Corps of Engineers. Built in 1965, and expanded in 1994, the Dale Hollow Hatchery is the largest Federal trout hatchery east of the Mississippi producing 1.5 million trout annually-an average production of 300,000 pounds-for distribution in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee.

The WondreCon audience responded with great excitement at the Dark Phoenix panel for the final Fox X-Men movie. Gambit, X-Force and more are almost definitely dead in the water now that the Disney/Fox deal is officially done. 20th Century Fox shows off even more new footage from Dark Phoenix in a new international trailer. Simon Kinberg explains why Dark Phoenix has taken so long to arrive, while also weighing in on this being the final Fox X-Men movie.
WASHINGTON -- Brenda Codallos was 4 when she came to the U.S. from Mexico. Now she may be sent back to a country she doesn't know. President Donald Trump revoked protections for Codallos and around 690,000 other unauthorized immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. The president and congressional leaders are trying to draft legislation that would allow them to stay in advance of Trump's March 5 deadline for phasing out the program. "I was born in Mexico but my whole life is America," said Codallos, 20, of Red Bank, a home health aide and an intern in an immigration lawyer's office.
Country singer Janelle Arthur has survived another round of 'American Idol.' The 23-year-old performer won enough votes to move forward this week after singing her own original arrangement of the Supremes classic 'Keep Me Hanging On' Wednesday night (March 27), to the universal praise of the judging panel. Armed only with her acoustic guitar, Arthur delivered a restrained version of the song that Keith Urban said brought out the underlying angst of the lyric in a different way, while Mariah Carey lauded the performance as "Janelle at her finest."

So that war on women thing didn’t work out very well. Let’s see how the President is doing with the war on coal. Romney’s ace in the hole might be the 18 counties in Ohio that still produce coal. Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency regulations targeting coal are not popular in those areas. Thousands of signs in southeast Ohio read, “Stop The War On Coal. Fire Obama,”according to Mark Weaver, a GOP strategist and part of Romney’s legal team in the state.
The Burbank Police Department welcomed four new officers last week and promoted three others from within to the ranks of sergeant, lieutenant and captain. Even with the new officers and promotions, the department still has seven vacant positions, which Police Administrator Josephine Wilson said she hopes to fill before the end of the year. In an effort to trim $1.95 million from the department’s budget — part of an across-the-board 5% cut at City Hall — Police Chief Scott LaChasse has proposed sharing the cost of three school resource officer positions with Burbank Unified School District and contracting out the crossing guard program.
WASHINGTON — A Senate panel has approved an aviation policy bill Wednesday after a partisan fight over whether airlines are unfairly gouging consumers with fees for basic services like checked bags, seat assignments and ticket changes. The Senate commerce committee approved by a voice vote a bill to continue the Federal Aviation Administration’s authority to operate through Oct. 1, 2017. That authority is currently due to expire on March 31. The committee’s Democrats led by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., tried to add a provision to the bill to prohibit airlines from setting unreasonable fee prices and direct the Department of Transportation to establish what is reasonable.

Before Sky Daddy even takes the stage at the Palace on Monday, a whole different tribute show is returning to the Elks Theatre and Performing Arts Center on Saturday, Oct. 7. Performing as Stevie Nicks in “Mirage — Visions of Fleetwood Mac,” Michelle Tyler said the show grew out of her Bella Donna show where she performs a tribute to Nicks. It was put together a couple of years ago and has been quite popular, she said. It’s going to be a 90-minute show that’s kept to all the hits, Tyler said.
Fears that Doncaster could eclipse their infamous ‘Another Bloody Sunday’ campaign were allayed at the Keepmoat Stadium yesterday when they finally got off the mark at the 21st time of asking this season. The Dons had looked to be heading for yet another defeat when Hunslet Hawks swooped to score three tries in the first ten minutes of the second half to post what looked to be a match-winning 26-6 lead. But they produced a spirited response, the like of which had not previously been seen this season, to score 28 points without reply to claim a thrilling victory finally secured with a late Dave Scott penalty.
I was asked recently, “Why do you identify as a feminist?” And for a few moments, I didn’t have an answer. When I came to Cornell, it was the first time I really started to understand the purpose and value of feminism and then share that purpose and value publicly. However, I never stopped to ask myself, “Why have my beliefs turned into a self-assigned label?” After reflecting on this question I realized that I call myself a feminist because I want others to know that I recognize the persisting inequality.

Question: whose 10-year bond yields have risen more in the past two days' trading: Italy or France? The answer is France, which has travelled from 3.15% on Wednesday morning to 3.48% Thursday afternoon (as at 6pm). Italy has gone from 6.75% to 6.95%. Of course, that's not the main story of the week, since Italy ended last week at 6.3% and touched 7.5% during Wednesday's drama. Even so, the blow-out in France's spread over Germany – a record in the euro era of 168 basis points – illustrates how the crisis is spreading.
UNITED NATIONS, Jul 19 2018 (IPS) - It is with great pleasure and pride that I interact with you this afternoon as India’s Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs, to share some thoughts on India’s extremely ambitious, and arguably the world’s largest planned urbanization programme under the leadership of our Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. In 1947, when we became an independent country, 17% of our population lived in urban areas. This 17% was on a population base of 350 million or so.

The Federal Reserve delayed tapering its quantitative easing bond-buying program, putting the risk of the decision at least another six weeks away. Daily trades on stocks, bonds and Treasurys all benefited from the announcement. The long-term impact, however, may be more dire. Economic implications forced the central financier to leave its asset purchases and forward guidance unchanged in September, bucking expectations. The move is drawing a fair amount of criticism. The chances of delaying the first agency mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasury taper until October or December are small, yet the Fed’s credibility could be tested.

Aug. 6, 2018 2:23 p.m. This guy was finally arrested after being ticketed in Grand Teton, this incident in Yellowstone and causing a disturbance in Glacier. Sounds like a classy guy. Hopefully he has some jail time or at the very least community service a long ways from any national park or wildlife. Aug. 6, 2018 2:07 p.m. Some think it is 'stupid'--as in 'you can't fix stupid' or 'you can't help stupid'.
Yogi Berra said, “Baseball is ninety percent mental and the other half physical.” His numbers are off, but his on-field stats, glove, and immense popularity landed him in Cooperstown, a place that enshrines baseball greats based upon metrics. Ever wonder why law—a trillion dollar global industry purportedly grounded in evidence, proof, and fact—is so remarkably devoid of meaningful metrics for performance and results? Baseball is a numbers game. There’s a metric for almost everything. Measures of individual performance—home runs, runs batted in, batting average, earned run average, etc.-- have been around for more than a century.
Wearing an authentic fur coat was a fashion statement and status symbol in years gone by. These days, real fur is out and faux fur is in. So, what should you do with your old authentic fur coat? only 17 years old, has found a way to solve the problem of what to do with a fur coat that is hanging around collecting dust. Her idea?

Lululemon founder Dennis “Chip” Wilson, whose yoga wear company is dealing with another round of consumer complaints over its pants, doesn’t think the quality concerns are the retailer’s fault. Instead, he told a Bloomberg Television reporter that "some women's bodies just actually don't work" in the pants, reiterating that "they don't work for some women's bodies." He went on to explain that "it's about the rubbing through the thighs and how much pressure is there" and how often they're worn over time.
Dr. Caroline Quach’s research focuses on preventing infections and aims to understand the dangers of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and vaccinepreventable diseases in children most at risk, to prevent them. “I love the creative aspect of medical research and my work at the intersection with public health allows me to see a direct transfer of my research findings into decision-making,” says Dr. Quach.

Soldiers may soon be carrying monitoring devices that can alert doctors thousands of miles away to medical emergencies and the need for treatment. The devices may even be implanted in soldiers and continuously monitor their status, the Army’s top doctor said in describing the near future of Army medicine. The monitors would send out streams of detailed data on a soldier’s health. For example, a device could measure blood sugar levels and a doctor or nurse hundreds or thousands of miles away can check on a soldier’s diabetes and recommend treatment or calibrate insulin.
Housing secretary James Brokenshire announced today (29 November) that under new legislation, combustible materials will not be permitted in the external walls of new buildings over 18m tall and containing housing. The Ministry of Housing confirmed the ban would also apply to new hospitals, residential care premises, dormitories in boarding schools and student accommodation over 18m tall. The new regulations will limit the use of materials in the external walls to products achieving a European fire-resistance classification of Class A1 or A2. The ban, which only applies to new buildings, will come into effect on 21 December.
The Holy See's suit . . . Loni Anderson's adventures in infomercials . . . Why is Mona Lisa smiling? Rumors that actress Sondra Locke has resolved her differences with Warner Bros. swirled every which way but loose late Friday as her lawsuit against the studio edged toward trial. She's taking the studio to court for its alleged role in a sham movie development deal secretly funded by Clint Eastwood. Locke charges that he dumped her, then settled her palimony claim by setting her up at the Warner Bros. lot. But, he never told her he was funding the deal.
Top quotes from the Eagles’ thrilling, roller-coaster, season-saving, ref-ripping 32-30 victory over the Houston Texans on Sunday at Lincoln Financial Field. It's third-and-10. The Eagles had just blown a 29-16 lead in the fourth quarter. Nick Foles completes a 19-yard pass to Alshon Jeffery to keep the drive alive — but is Nick Foles alive? Foles was bulldozed by Jadeveon Clowney and is flat on his back in the end zone. Center Jason Kelce held himself responsible. He was still alive, and minutes later — thanks to Zach Ertz, Darren Sproles and Jake Elliott — so was the Eagles’ season.

TORRANCE — The Ishibashi family’s farm stand at Torrance Airport is holding a going-out-of-business sale on Saturday, March 10, at 8 a.m., according to blogger LA Farm Girl (http://lafarmgirl.blogspot.com/). It is located at 24955 Crenshaw Blvd. in Torrance. The last of the Japanese American families that farmed on and around the Palos Verdes Peninsula for more than a century, the Ishibashis closed the stand last October following the death of family patriarch Tom Ishibashi in May at age 82. His wife, Maya, died in November 2009.
The Rev.

Conner has been gracious as hosts of the annual LaRosa’s Holiday Classic off the court. On the court, the Cougars have been too gracious for head coach Aaron Stamm most of the time. In the first five years of the tournament, Conner won it once, but now they are two-time defending champions after beating Highlands 51-41 Friday in the championship game. Conner improved to 11-2 overall. "The goal is to win it but we always bring some good teams in," Stamm said. "Highlands has won it a few times.
LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Italian bond yields edged lower on Monday after Fitch left its credit rating unchanged at BBB, revising only its outlook to negative, though mixed news flow from senior ministers and manufacturing PMI data due later this morning could mean the rally is short-lived, analysts said. Elsewhere yields edged higher across the euro zone with trade wars and EM currency weakness prompting risk aversion. On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump said there was no need to keep Canada in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The data retained by GDS is accessible, without warrant or other impediments, by all major intelligence agencies and the larger, or national, police entities. Many Third Party Res systems run by some notorious on-line travel agents' also have unlimited access. too. This includes several in the USA and a couple in the UK. Unbelievably, when the GDS (read > https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Distribution_System <) were developed by the airlines, there were few checks - everything was based upon 'trust'. After all, these systems were subsets of airlines.
The Hillsborough County School District deemed the attempted lesson offensive. TAMPA — The Florida middle school teacher who asked students to fill out a "privilege" form as part of an assignment resigned from the Hillsborough County School District on Thursday. Yoselis Ramos, who taught Spanish at Monroe Middle School, was suspended last week for passing out a "how privileged are you?" list to seventh- and eighth-graders in two of Ramos' Spanish classes as an extension of literature the students were reading. In addition to race, the form asked students about their disability status, gender and sexual orientation, and religion.
The corpse was found floating near the Brooklyn Army Terminal earlier this month, police said. Tattoos of a money bag, boxing gloves and a skeleton playing cards could help police identify a body that was pulled from New York waters earlier this month. The body, of a man believed to be in his 30s, was found floating in the Bay Ridge Channel near the Brooklyn Army Terminal in Sunset Park shortly after 11 a.m. March 13, police said. The decomposed body was unidentified, but multiple tattoos on the man’s left arms are visible.
There’s a disconnect between shoppers and gift recipients this holiday season. According to a survey conducted for the National Retail Federation, consumers plan to spend less on gift cards this year compared to last year. However, gift cards top holiday wish lists for the ninth year in a row, making them the most popular present for U.S. adults. What gives? The survey suggests shoppers are finding gifts earlier and for better prices this year, making the gift card less necessary. However, gift cards are the procrastinator’s go-to gift and there’s still plenty of time to fulfill wish lists.
There is one clear lesson we can all learn from the two storms that battered Louisiana, Mississippi and East Texas: If you expect to have water to drink and food to eat after a major catastrophe, you’d better stockpile them yourself. The aftermath of the second storm shows that the Federal Emergency Management Agency learned nothing from its first fiasco. People in Louisiana and East Texas are, as of this writing, begging for assistance, and it’s not there. Oh, it’ll get there eventually. After all, FEMA has awarded a whole bunch of no-bid, noncompetitive contracts.
A new study shows gentrification greatly affects the nation's biggest cities. Buying food today is a straightforward process. Products are made under strict hygiene standards, the ingredients are usually clearly labelled, and the origin of the product is named. In Victorian England, it was far more hazardous. There are not enough antibiotics in development globally to meet current and anticipated patient needs. After "bomb cyclone" storms hit the Midwest, large swaths of Nebraska, Iowa, and Missouri farmland were stricken with floods. Baby calves were swept into freezing floodwaters, washing up dead along the banks of swollen rivers.
With the arrival of better weather (recent rains notwithstanding), it seems like my inbox has also "sprung" with more information. Today, I'd like to follow up on the name of a drive-in restaurant, and then share a couple of new questions that could use your help! 2. Who was owner of Jack's store? 3. And who was H.H. Haugh? Back in March, reader Linda Lehman wrote to ask about the name of a drive-in eatery on East Market Street in Springettsbury Township, around where Dairy Queen and Rita's are now.
Shalowitz said 20 engine units responded to battle the fire, which was set off in hot conditions with a 20 mph breeze. Near the crash site, a smoldering wing, fuselage and tail of the aircraft were visible on the horizon. The fire was extinguished Tuesday afternoon. The names of the pilots were not released. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein posted on Facebook that he was “deeply saddened” by the death of the pilot. “We offer our deepest condolences to the airman’s family and to all who are mourning this tremendous loss,” he said.

Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal on Thursday rejected Union minister Virbhadra Singh's charges of violations in granting land relaxations to Supreme Court lawyer and Team Anna member Prashant Bhushan at Palampur tea estate. Instead, he reminded Singh of the "irregularities", which Congress government under him had committed to give land belonging to Himachal Pradesh to the Tibetans. On February 21, Virbhadra had alleged that Bhushan's society had been illegally allowed to buy a tea garden in the state. According to the Himachal Pradesh Ceiling on Land Holdings Act-1972, tea garden land cannot be diverted to any other use except for tea plantations.
Misty Blue, a fishing vessel out of New Bedford, sank 10 miles off the coast of Nantucket Monday evening. The search for a missing clam boat that sank off the coast of Nantucket last week is on hold Monday as divers wait for safer conditions to go into the Atlantic Ocean. Seven days have passed since the “Misty Blue’’ disappeared into the water, and two its crew members — Michael Roberts, 49, and Jonathan Saraiva, 32 — remain missing. State Police spokesman David Procopio said rough seas have prevented divers from going into the water to check on the sunken vessel.
From Brussels there were reports of snatched and anxious conversations between European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and key EU figures including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande. “All eyes are turned on Britain,” said French newspaper Le Figaro yesterday, stressing that the result of the referendum would reverberate far beyond Britain’s borders. Should Britain choose to quit the EU, it could “start a minor revolution in Europe”. Writing in Corriere della Sera, Aldo Cazzullo said that if Britaiin decided to stay in the EU, it would be in part thanks to Jo Cox.

We’ve reached the point in the regular season where the new redshirt rule is about to become a non-factor. It’s not there yet, only because the number of remaining games isn’t set for Purdue. It depends on whether the Boilermakers win the Big Ten West and play in the conference championship game. They could play five more games, including a bowl game. Winning the division remains a possibility but Purdue needs help to climb to the top spot. The reason we mention this? Co-defensive coordinator Nick Holt is looking at using safety freshman Cory Trice when the Boilermakers face the Golden Gophers.
The screed on the "heartlessness" of the Catholic Church is venom at its best, right up there with a typical Anti-Defamation League attack. The writer displays an ignorance of history that is astounding and from the venom conveys a feeling of some personal wrong. While the bishops carry on their destructive behavior against the country, they have done the same against the church. There is a difference between church teachings and the attitude of the current bishops. Theologically, many of the bishops have ignored church teaching on homosexuality and have long tolerated, if not endorsed, theological error.
Kylie Jenner: Does She Blame Kendall For Her Lack of Modeling Success?! by Tyler Johnson at August 5, 2016 12:52 pm . As you're probably aware, Kylie Jenner is incredibly famous. In fact, by some measures Kylie is more popular online than any of her mega-star sisters. Obviously, she owes much of her renown to her sisters, but over the past year, Kylie has really struck out on her own. First there were Kylie's lip kits, so popular that they sold out within minutes, and the demand crashed her company's website.

Wrestling Inc reached out to WWE in regards to the rumored discomfort amongst some talents.
Can technology bridge the gap between parents and their children? When I was a kid, my parents never understood why I study with the TV turned on even if I am not watching. I had access to technology late in my childhood — never had an Atari or a Game & Watch, but had access to them because my cousins had them. I had computer classes in high school, but never really owned one after a year in college (thanks to my geek uncle in the US — thanks, Tito Vic, I never forget).
GLEN COVE, N.Y. (CBSNewYork) — Dozens of Jewish centers have been targeted with threats since January, and the surge of hate crimes and threats prompted the president’s first remarks on the subject Tuesday. Teaching painful lessons of the past to their granddaughter, the Goodmans toured Nassau County’s Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center amid a nationwide uptick in antisemitism. “Every day there is something, either with a Jewish center or some other place where they’re threatening with bombs, or on houses where they put the Nazi symbol,” Sharon Goodman, a retired Holocaust teacher, told CBS2’s Carolyn Gusoff.

Or blow me a kiss, and that&apos;s lucky too. Surprisingly, I can&apos;t remember what was actually being said here for some reason. This one&apos;s ... for the ladies. The Victorians liked their underwear with lots of frills, or as they called them, "flavor curls." This brings new meaning to the term "booth babe." The French Postcard show did not allow photographs. In order to make this up to you, we provide this photo of some guys playing some music.
We haven’t seen her around Oakdale for awhile but Rosemary Prinz (Penny Hughes) has been keeping busy. The veteran actress will be starring in a new production of Neil Simon’s “Lost In Yonkers.” The award winning play follows two boys coming of age as their raised by their eccentric relatives.

Work-related injuries and illnesses among Louisiana private companies fell to their lowest level in 13 years. The state’s unemployment rate remained at 6 percent as Louisiana continued to lose oil and gas jobs in September, according to the most recent data released today. A new federal report says 120 Louisiana workers died on the job in 2014. Louisiana’s overall labor force grew in April thanks in part to job additions in the professional and business services industry. Costs per claim have remained flat in Louisiana while costs in other states have increased, according to a new report by the Worker’s Compensation Institute.
A DOZEN blobs of light glowed on Capt. Geoffrey Macfarlane's sky-blue radar screen as he steered "SeaCat Scotland" out of Dover harbor. Each blob represented a vessel likely to cross the path of Hoverspeed's huge car-carrying catamaran as it headed for Calais. "The English Channel is the busiest waterway in the world, with around 500 ship movements a day, and it seems to get more crowded every year," the skipper said as his twin-hulled ship reared up out of the water and picked up speed to 32 knots. "It's becoming an art to dodge the traffic."
It may be a zombie bite, a rival group's attack, or just a lone walk toward the great unknown. No matter what you call it, Rick Grimes will soon be gone from The Walking Dead. Several news outlets are reporting that Andrew Lincoln will be exiting the series sometime in season nine. Entertainment Weekly has independently confirmed a report from Collider that Lincoln is ending his years-long run on The Walking Dead next season (we reached out to AMC but they declined to comment). Lincoln has been with the show since the very beginning, playing the sheriff-turned-apocalypse leader.
Chesterfield star Rhys Yates made the best possible start to his preparations for an assault on the Prestone MSA British Rally Championship (BRC) this week. For he took third place overall at the Speyside stages in Elgin, Scotland for round two of the ARR Craib MSA Scottish Rally Championship. Yates is looking forward to his third season in the BRC, which kicks off with the Pirelli International Rally at Carlisle on Saturday. And he’s certainly in good shape if his efforts to make the podium in a tough, 100-strong field in Scotland are anything to go by.
Allegations that a U.S. soldier suspected of killing 17 Afghan civilians briefly returned to his base in the midst of the attacks are among the developments that have surfaced in the case in recent days. U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, 38, is accused of walking into two villages near an Army outpost in Kandahar province’s Panjwai district and killing men, women and children on March 11. U.S. authorities have said Bales acted alone, leaving at night and eventually surrendering at his base. The U.S. military has charged Bales with 17 counts of murder with premeditation, for which he could face the death penalty.
State approval of the two final street crossings on the Expo Line light rail will have to wait at least two weeks: The California Public Utilities Commission this morning punted the decision to its Dec. 18 meeting in order to have more time to consider the issue. Here's a little background. The first phase of the Expo Line is currently under construction from downtown Los Angeles to Culver City. The PUC has already signed off on 36 of 38 street crossings on the line, but two crossings still need approval -- one outside the Foshay Learning Center and the other outside Dorsey High School.
IBM’s Project Debater, an AI system that can engage in live debate with humans, today faced off with 2016 World Debating Championship grand finalist and 2012 European Debate champion Harish Natarajan. The debate was about preschool subsidies, with Project Debater arguing in favor and Natarajan arguing against. More than 50 percent of the audience at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco said in a poll taken after the debate that Debater enriched their knowledge of the subject, while about 20 percent said the same of Natarajan’s argument.
For years, comedians and commentators have bemoaned the fact that jetpacks, as imagined in 1950s sci-fi movies, never materialized. As of spring 2012, though, the dream will become a reality — if you have $100,000 to spend, that is. A Dania Beach, Fla., company called JetLev will begin shipping its water-powered JetLev R200 early next year, according to the company's website. The suggested retail price: $99,500. JetLev claims the R200 will propel you to a height of 30 feet (the hose is 33 feet long) at a top speed of 25 mph.

There’s little question that HTC wishes 2012 had gone just a little better — the beleaguered smartphone company posted awfully disappointing results quarter after quarter, while rivals like Samsung and Apple continued to hit milestone after milestone. CEO Peter Chou firmly believes that the worst is over though, and that the company he helms can truly turn its fortunes around. Now, here in New York (as well as at a parallel event in London), HTC has just introduced the device it hopes will help do all that — the HTC One.
Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) recently highlighted Harvey County's Youth As Resources (YAR) program on its website. CADCA's doing so has brought some positive attention to the program. Prevention coordinator for Mirror, Inc. Des Martens, who piloted the original project in 2006, said the Mirror's YAR program, which is gaining a lot of local momentum, is based upon the idea that youth are a valuable community resource – one that can be directly utilized. Martens said 2006 data showed YAR influenced positive changes in numbers for underage drinking at that time.
London — Brent crude fell on Friday, weighed down by surging US supply and concerns of a global economic slowdown, but falling oil cartel Opec supplies put a floor under prices. International Brent crude futures were at $66.08 a barrel at 10.37am GMT, down 23c from Thursday’s settlement. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $57.24 a barrel, up 2c. The US Energy Department said on Thursday that it is offering up to 6-million barrels of crude from national emergency reserves to raise funds to modernise US strategic oil reserves.
Many Palestinian women face high levels of domestic violence. Credit: Jillian Kestler-D'Amours/IPS. RAMALLAH, Occupied West Bank, Aug 16 2012 (IPS) - After the brutal murder of a Palestinian woman in late July in a busy Bethlehem marketplace, local human rights groups are pushing for stronger reforms to stem violence against women in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Nancy Zaboun, a 27-year-old mother of three, was violently killed by her husband on Jul. 30 in Bethlehem. The murder took place after Zaboun left a divorce hearing. Her husband had reportedly beaten her regularly over the course of their ten-year marriage.
It all began with a box gone astray. The shipment hailed from Blue Apron, one of the meal kit purveyors emerging in recent years to harness millennials’ inclination for good food and online commerce to their disinclination to shop for and make nightly dinners from scratch. In her Washoe Valley home last year, Christie Casey-Braun opened the box on auto-pilot, thinking it was a giveaway or promotion or sample, not noticing the box should have been delivered to her neighbor. She prepared the contents — fish cakes, a mushroom stir-fry — liking the convenience but worrying about packaging waste and how far ingredients had been shipped.
The smartphone to beat this season is the Galaxy S6 Edge. It’s slim, stylish, and powerful, a mashup between the previous Galaxy S series with the original iPod Touch. It’s well-made and unique, a combination rarely found in cellphones these days and it is as far from the Galaxy S5 as the T-1000 was from the original Terminator. In short, it’s pretty cool and probably the only S6 – the other being the non-curved standard model – I’d buy. This review is primarily about the S6 Edge.

Irish woman Ciara Donnelly is fighting an extremely rare form of cancer that affects only one in a million. The Bray native was diagnosed with Urachal Adenocarcinoma earlier this year. According to the Irish Independent, the Urachus makes up your umbilical cord as a baby and stems from behind the belly button down to the bladder. For most people, this dissipates into nothing and causes no concern, however for a very rare few - one in a million people - it develops into a rare and aggressive cancer. Donnelly was diagnosed after suffering back-to-back bladder infections for months without antibiotics kicking in.
The council selected Rossi from among three candidates nominated by the King County Republican Central Committee to replace Hill. Rossi was the first choice of county Republicans, followed by Toby Nixon, a Kirkland City Council member and former state representative, and Joel Hussey, a Redmond aerospace executive. Rossi was the first choice of 46 members of the Republican Central Committee, while Nixon got just one first-place vote and Hussey got none. Nixon, speaking before the council Monday, endorsed Rossi for the Senate seat. Rossi was sworn into the Senate immediately after the County Council voted to select him.
For the first eight months of his presidency, Donald Trump has been continually thwarted by a combination of the left wing media, the “deep state” bureaucracy, the Democrats and the establishment Republicans. On his own, President Trump has made dramatic and positive executive orders, but his legislative agenda has been disappointing due to the powerful forces arrayed against him. Theoretically, the President should have been able to achieve all of his goals because the Republicans control all branches of government. Unfortunately, the inept congressional leadership has not produced any major victories for the President or his 63 million supporters.
U2 lead singer Bono will be the speaker at the University of Pennsylvania's 248th graduation ceremonies on May 17.

Bono was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his work to relieve Third World debt and promote AIDS awareness.
The Weeknd has plenty of reasons to celebrate. After an epic 2015, the Canadian crooner is nominated for seven Grammys at Monday’s ceremony and an Oscar for his Fifty Shades of Grey hit “Earned It.” In a new interview with the Los Angeles Times, he reflects on his success, the lack of diversity at the Oscars, and advice from Diddy. His moment was nearly overshadowed after the Academy Awards faced backlash for its lack of diversity among nominees. It was something The Weeknd, the only major nominee of color, didn’t initially notice.
Britvic shares are up 37pc in 3 months. Questor says sell. AS Scotland mulls leaving the United Kingdom one Scottish company is considering a union with its larger cousin south of the border.

California mom June Emerson made a startling discovery Friday when she reviewed photos of her visit to Manhattan Beach, noticing the outline of a great white shark near her surfing son. In one image, her 12-year-old son and his friend appear on surfboards in front of a huge wave, with the shadow of a shark a few feet away. Emerson said the image was quite a shock to see. Sightings of sharks at Manhattan Beach are not uncommon and have attracted a number of thrill seekers.

Tomo Suzuki is a university lecturer of accounting and professor of sustainability science at the Saïd Business School, University of Oxford. The great German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe has one of his characters in Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre call double-entry bookkeeping “one of the finest inventions of the human mind". His portrayal may have been ironic, but if you do bookkeeping well, you really do feel the beauty of it. As businesses have grown globally, accounting has had to adapt. International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) have been established.

Centralized companies consolidate decision making with a small group of leaders, who often have offices at a central headquarters or office. This approach to company operations is in contrast to a decentralized approach, where mangers of local business units or stores make most of the important decisions for their units. Centralization has several benefits relative to decentralization. By centralizing operations, you keep important decisions in the hands of your topic experts. Human resource professionals put together and lead your HR activities. Professional buyers purchase most or all of the products sold at your stores.
Aren’t you the guy, you know, who cooks on TV?” asked the manager of Filipino grocery Seafood City, as she processed the gift certificates we were using. While countless Pinoys travel to the United States every year and stuff themselves with great food, I know of very few who make an extra trip to St. Louis for a food trip. I thought I was going to die. No, I was sure of it. Every year since 2016, I’ve been flying to Chicago to participate in the Kultura Festival produced by Filipino Kitchen.
Presidential power over a party or Congress comes from enough lawmakers needing, fearing or genuinely liking them. Donald Trump has none of this. Almost four months into office, Trump has been unable to gain leverage over his party, especially in the Senate, much less Congress as a whole. Senate Republicans don't need him. They're pressing ahead with their investigations into Russian interference in the election and pushing sanctions against Vladimir Putin. They're pushing their own health care bill on their own timetable and hardly rushing to Trump's defense.
The last few days have been good days for Naples Street residents Betty and David Dunn. Like many of their neighbors on the residential street hit hard by last weekend�s storm, the Dunns had trees and limbs down throughout their yard. A big tree split in two and fell on their roof, and the driveway was filled with large tree limbs and branches. They got in touch with Clearview Tree Service in Princeton, and owner Thomas W. Lyons and a crew took about two hours to restore the Dunns� life back to some semblance of normalcy.
The Obama administration warned states on Tuesday that federal highway funds will be largely depleted in August, limiting the money states can expect from Washington to pay for road and bridge projects this summer. The political stalemate in Congress over transportation spending means drivers will have to endure more potholes and detour around more unsafe bridges, delaying commutes, excursions and the delivery of products to market. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told states the government will slow federal reimbursement for highway repairs in August as the U.S. Highway Trust Fund drops below a critical threshold next month.
Decentralisation of al-Qaeda power structure allowed for global franchising but diluted bin Laden's authority. The Facebook page set up in honour of al-Qaeda's founder is entitled "We are all Osama bin Laden". But it is this reality – the fact that anyone anywhere can commit a violent act using the al-Qaeda brand – which has proved most damaging for the organisation. After 9/11 and the destruction of al-Qaeda's headquarters in Afghanistan, al-Qaeda fractured into a moving target, a global cadre of autonomous cells which enabled it to continue to both elude and fight its enemies.
We just witnessed the most savage Bachelor episode in modern history, and we’ll never be the same. Not only did Arie Luyendyk Jr. tell two women he loved them, but one contestant’s ex showed up to confront Arie and propose to his lost love. Here’s what you missed. After a perfect fantasy suite date with Becca, Arie received an unwanted visitor: Becca’s ex, Ross (because of course his name is Ross). Arie’s first reaction was, “Why is hotel management here?” and that small moment made this entire season worth it.

France may break EU budget deficit limit after Macron pledged to increase wages and cut taxes following violent Yellow Vest protests | City A.M.
France could break the European Union’s budget deficit limit next year if it does not impose spending cuts after President Emmanuel Macron caved into the demands of anti-government protesters. Yesterday Macron announced wage increases for the poorest workers and a tax cut for pensioners, leaving the government attempting to devise budget savings or risk overshooting the EU’s three per cent GDP limit. Any sign of leniency over the deficit could complicate tense discussions with the Italian government over its budget.
Unions should have been consulted about plans to introduce an integrated public transport system controlled by municipalities, the Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) said on Thursday. “Our federation is yet to be officially informed of any such decisions, yet our members are the people that are going to be affected,” said general secretary Dennis George in a statement. On Wednesday, transport department director general George Mahlalela said Cape Town had been chosen as a pilot for the proposed venture. At present, subsidies were provided by the provincial government for taxis, and by the national department for commuter rail transport and taxis.
More than a million vehicles with potentially deadly Takata airbags have been added to a recall list by the consumer watchdog. The defective airbags can shatter shards of metal upon activation if the propelling mechanism is exposed to high levels of moisture. They have caused about 180 injuries and 18 deaths worldwide and been linked to at least one fatality in Australia. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on Sunday published a revised recall list which added a further 1.1 million vehicles targeted for future airbag replacement, including the Mercedes Benz C Class, Ford Mondeo and Toyota Yaris.

Seven months later: Japan’s nuclear predicament. A radiation detector in Iitate, where some of the heaviest concentrations of fallout were found. Once known as one of Japan’s most beautiful villages, it was given an official order to evacuate. On the afternoon of March 11th—a Friday—the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, on Japan’s Pacific coast, had more than six thousand workers inside. The plant, about a hundred and fifty miles north of Tokyo, is painted white and pale blue and is a labyrinth of boxy buildings and piping on a campus larger than the Pentagon’s.

India's players celebrate their superb 87-run victory at Kingsmead in the second Test. (CNN) -- India leveled the three-match series against South Africa with an 87-run victory in the second Test in Durban on Wednesday, ensuring the tourists will remain number one in the world rankings whatever the outcome of the decider in Cape Town next week. South Africa, second in the Test standings, needed to complete a 3-0 series sweep to leapfrog their opponents into top spot. But set a victory target of 303, the home side were dismissed for 215, just an hour after lunch on the penultimate day.
In the midst of horrifying events like the massacre at VA Tech University, personal struggles and dreams and miracles go on in our daily lives. I think I would have started weeping right there and then if the day’s news events hadn’t already taken my last tear. Here was my little girl, now 8 years old, asking if she could pierce her ears. I told her I would have to think about it. She was so excited she squealed when I called her back and told her it was ok. My precious little girl was becoming, slowly but inevitably, a young lady.
A giant export terminal proposed north of Bellingham, which would send coal to China, must undergo a sweeping review of environmental, transportation, health and climate impacts, the state Department of Ecology, Whatcom County and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced on Wednesday. The review, insisted on by Ecology, is a potential blow to the Gateway Pacific project and a victory for critics who argue that such factors as mile-long trains, passing through Seattle and other Western Washington cities, should be evaluated along with impacts immediately around the Cherry Point terminal site.

T-Mobile has just rolled out a service called HotSpot @Homethat allows you to use a WiFi-enabled cell phone to make calls via a wireless network. You'll still use the phone with regular cellular airwaves while on the move, but once you're in range of a T-Mobile Hotspot or a pre-configured WiFi access point, the phone will know to automatically switch over. The best part? Call minutes made via WiFi aren't deducted from your plan. That's right -- as long as you're within range of a wireless broadband network, you'll have unlimited calls.

Either Mark Jackson is allergic to NBA Hall of Famers, or he's an amalgam of supremely stubborn and oddly high maintenance. Many of the Golden State Warriors head coach's tactics and preferences are weird or inexplicable. His alleged treatment of Hall of Famer Jerry West is both. According to Grantland's Zach Lowe, "Jackson has asked that Jerry West, a high-level adviser in Golden State, not attend most practices and team activities," because, well, we don't really know. Maybe Jackson isn't impressed by West's 25,192 career points.
Whiplash is one of the hazards of my job. I take unfamiliar streets when I drive around town with the express purpose of discovering new restaurants. Peacha's, a tiny place on south Victory near Alameda in Burbank, made me do a hard double-take, almost hitting the car in front of me. Luckily, I didn't. Instead, I got to enjoy the best chimichanga of my life. In all fairness, I don't normally do chimichangas, with the deep-frying and all, but I had to believe the nice guy behind the counter when he said they were really good.

A live-in housekeeper who allegedly gave birth in the bathroom of her employer’s Long Island, N.Y., waterfront mansion has been charged with second degree murder. The woman reportedly kept the pregnancy secret even from her husband. After the birth last Sunday, authorities claim she put the baby in a plastic bag and asked her husband to put what she told him was garbage in a trash bin. She then asked her spouse to take her to the hospital because she wasn’t felling well. Hospital staff apparent called Suffolk County Police after they examined her and determined she had given birth.
Question: I am a woman in my 60s. My father had colon cancer. I’ve had several colonoscopies over the years with the removal of one or two polyps. How often should I be screened? One doctor says every three years and another says every five. Polyps are the most common findings discovered in people who undergo colorectal screening or who have a diagnostic work-up for symptoms. In the 1970s, such patients used to have annual follow-up surveillance examinations to detect additional new or missed adenomas, which are the most common type of polyps.

Two trains, on a collision course, running out of track. That’s as apt a metaphor as any for the rising tension over the future of Northern Pulp and looming closure date for the plant’s Boat Harbour effluent treatment site. The company says it cannot possibly meet the Jan. 31, 2020 deadline for ending treatment in the heavily polluted lagoon. The paper mill submitted environmental assessment regulation documents last week that laid out details of its planned — and controversial — new effluent treatment facility, including piping treated waste into the Northumberland Strait.
Everton have identified Walton Hall Park as the intended site of a new stadium to replace Goodison Park.

The relationship between New York's Catholic Governor Andrew Cuomo and the church is growing more tense; reaction from Father Jonathan Morris, Fox News contributor. Amid Catholic leaders&apos; calls for excommunication, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has dug in his heels and defended a controversial state law that loosens the rules on abortion. The law allows abortions to be performed by non-doctors up until the point of birth for many reasons. Cuomo, who touts his Catholic faith and who once was an altar boy, brushed off criticism of the law on Tuesday.
Exxon Mobil is fighting back against reports the company knowingly deceived the public about global warming, claiming reporters “distorted” documents and interviews to vilify the oil giant. “Columbia’s team ignored statements, included in the same documents they cited, demonstrating that our researchers recognized the developing nature of climate science at the time, which mirrored global scientific understanding,” Exxon lead spokesman Kenneth Cohen wrote to Bollinger in a letter obtained by Politico. “And they ignored information provided by the company that contradicted the erroneous story line,” Cohen added.
A Nairobi-bound Ethiopian Airlines Boeing crashed minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa Sunday, killing all eight crew and 149 passengers on board, including tourists, business travellers and UN staff.

"The House of People’s Representatives have declared March 11, 2019, a national day of mourning for citizens of all countries that have passed in this tragic accident," Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's office said on Twitter.
NEWARK, Del. - NEWARK, Del. (AP) — No skater has a more daunting challenge at the Vancouver Olympics than Patrick Chan. A Canadian man has never won the Olympic figure skating gold medal. They've come close, particularly Brian Orser earning silver in 1984 and 1988. Now, the pressure is on Chan to produce on home ice, and he won't run away from it. "I know I'm going to be as excited as ever and that you have to block out distractions, of which there will be more than ever," says Chan, who turned 19 Thursday.

He and a neighbor managed to lure the horse toward them with a handful of grass, Sickinger said, and they even petted the horse for a bit. Sickinger had a strap he planned to use to bridle the horse, but he said better judgment took over and he decided the horse was too wild to control even if he could wrangle it. Sickinger told a St. Clair County sheriff’s deputy the horse might belong to a neighbor. There are several horse farms in the area, but none came forward as the owner, Sickinger said.

A visitor checking out the bicycle sharing system at the station in Beach Street, George Town. I WAS impressed with the bicycle sharing system in Taipei, Taiwan, when I first came across it during my visit there in 2013. I recall standing in front of a bike sharing kiosk at Xinyi district near Taiwan’s iconic Taipei 101 skyscraper, reading the instructions on the electronic display panel and figuring out how the system works. Registered users could grab a bike from a kiosk in less than a minute, cycle and later return it to any kiosk nearest to them.
As the nation of Libya begun to fall into revolution, one of Gaddafi's sons was on a US State Department approved month long tour of America. Khamis Gaddafi, 27, came for his month long American adventure as part of an internship with AECOM, a global infrastructure company based in the US with business ties in Libya. Recent reports indicated Khamis has been killed in Libya by a disaffected military pilot.

The SNP's internal feud reached new depths of bitterness last night when party leader Alex Salmond was told by treasurer Ian Blackford to apologise for criticisms made last week or face being sued for defamation. As moves continued to oust Mr Blackford, the party was also preparing disciplinary action against one of his closest allies, Ms Margo MacDonald, who faces accusations of breaking internal rules by publicly challenging a parliamentary group decision. Ms MacDonald, a critic of Mr Salmond's leadership style, will be dealt with on Thursday at a meeting which her supporters claim could mark the start of a campaign to have her deselected.
The visit of a Russian delegation to Damascus has raised hopes of talks between the Assad government and the opposition. Experts say Moscow is eager for negotiations in Syria, while the West is only interested in toppling the government. Richard Heydarian, a Manila-based foreign affairs analyst, has told RT that Russia will put a lot of pressure on the Assad regime for any kind of resolution of the problem. He believes the Russians feared that the UN draft resolution, if accepted, could become a pretext for some sort of military intervention. Moscow, he said, will do its best to solve the crisis.
TORONTO (JTA) — Jewish groups are satisfied that a decision by Canada’s best-known department store chain to drop an Israeli beauty line is unrelated to boycott calls. A joint statement Jan. 13 by The Bay stores, UJA Federation of Greater Toronto and the Canada Israel Committee said that The Bay was dropping AHAVA beauty products "primarily because of sales results which had been declining for several years." The announcement came days after a pro-Palestinian coalition, Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East, launched a boycott campaign against The Bay for selling the popular AHAVA line of Dead Sea beauty products.

Lauren Bushnell Split With Ben Higgins Over Jojo Fletcher – The Bachelor 2016 Engagement and Wedding Off? The Bachelor 2016 spoilers tease that in the Season 20 finale episode Ben Higgins will give his final rose to Lauren Bushnell, and send runner-up Jojo Fletcher home broken-hearted, without an engagement ring.

And it’s not just jobs that look strong. Paychecks are growing. Hourly earnings climbed 3.2% in January from January 2018, and data released Thursday show that wages and salaries rose 3.1% in the final three months of 2018 compared to the same months the prior year. Not since the end of the Great Recession a decade ago have wages risen like this. Since mid-2009 the foreign-born employment share has risen by about 2.6 percentage points—implying that wages would be about 1% higher than they are today had an immigration moratorium been in effect since then. Hottest economy in the world?

Extreme winter weather keeps a firm grip on much of the United States with dangerously low temperatures throughout the rest of this week. CNN's Jennifer Gray reports. A massive "bombogenesis" -- an area of rapidly declining low pressure -- will wreak havoc on the Northeast this week, threatening hurricane-force winter wind gusts and blinding snow. The bombogenesis will result in what's known as a "bomb cyclone." And the bomb cyclone, expected to strike Thursday, will likely dump 6 to 12 inches of snow in New England and hurl 40- to 60-mph gusts.

Fights between powerful combatants form the foundation of many mythological tales. In the epic film Clash of the Titans, Perseus, the mortal son of Zeus, must kill the monstrous Kraken before it can annihilate his beloved Princess Andromedra and the citizenry of Joppa. Perseus heroically decapitates the dreaded Gorgon Medusa to obtain the most powerful weapon of his time: her snake-covered head. A single glance from Medusa’s countenance turns the Kraken to stone, the local residents are saved from a horrible fate, and Perseus and Andromeda live happily ever after.
Blacks already feeling the pinch from a housing shortage in the New Orleans area after Hurricane Katrina are facing racial discrimination in their search for rental property, a survey by housing advocates found. The survey sent black and white "testers" — paired by matching incomes, careers, family types and rental histories — to inquire about openings at 40 rental properties in metropolitan New Orleans. The findings, released Tuesday by the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, found blacks encountered "less favorable treatment" than their white counterparts in 57.5 percent of those tests.
Moments ago, a firefight erupted near the Fox News crew’s location in Gaza City as the Israeli ground invasion continues. Fox News correspondent John Huddy spoke to Megyn Kelly tonight about the situation in Gaza. “We’ve had that kind of action before in the seven, eight days that we’ve been here now, but not with such frequency as we’ve seen tonight,” Huddy said, adding that the battle has intensified in the last 24 hours. He said there have been about four or five airstrikes over the course of the last couple of hours.

SEATTLE – Branden Jackson put his hard hat on and went to work. No, literally. The Seahawks’ second-year defensive end went to Lowe’s this week to buy home supplies, and left with a neon yellow construction vest and a white hard hat instead. He bought the set because he knew it would match his lime green sneakers. But that wasn’t the only reason. The 6-foot-4, 295-pound Jackson did just that on Thursday, to the tune of three tackles and one tackle for loss in the Seahawks’ 30-19 defeat to the Oakland Raiders.

Upbeat on plans: Girija Pande of TCS says the company’s revenues from its Chinese operations will grow by around 45% in the next two years. Hyderabad: With business from the US and Europe expected to decrease due to the ongoing financial turmoil, Indian information technology services (IT) firms are increasing their focus on the Asia Pacific region, particularly China, in an effort to tap the latter’s IT market and use it as a strategic base to enter the at least $100 billion (Rs4.76 trillion)-a-year Japanese IT market.

Cisco, of San Jose, Calif., will work with IBM to offer enhanced grid services for SANs (storage area networks).
What if the West responded to Hamas's victory not with sanctions but with a commitment to resume negotiations from where they left off in 2000? On Gaza’s Omar El-Mukhtar Street a Palestinian boy lobs rocks at an election banner posting Gaza City’s five victorious Hamas candidates. Down the road thousands of activists from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah movement storm Gaza’s parliamentary building, venting their rage at an institution and a leadership they hold responsible for an abject defeat. The violent implosion of Fatah is one consequence of Hamas’s triumph in the Palestinian Authority (PA) parliamentary elections on January 25.

The long-serving former manager of Portadown FC has said that Victor Gordon’s family can be justifiably proud of the legacy he has left. Mr Gordon, the veteran Portadown Times journalist, died after a short illness on Sunday night. Ronnie McFall – who managed the club for nearly three decades until leaving last year – said that Victor had remained an ardent attendee right to the end of his life. He said that Victor “never missed” a match, whether home or away, and that he and his daughter Fiona had attended games “right up to the last”.
The Joffrey Ballet School and the New School University will offer a new degree program in dance, starting in the fall of 1999, the two institutions announced yesterday.

Preston Grasshoppers host Hinckley on Saturday hoping to extend their winning run to six games and to avenge their heaviest defeat of the season by 49-5 back in November. The Leicestershire club had built a big squad with a powerful pack and started the season well with six consecutive wins. Preston were well beaten up front and their cause was not helped by two yellow cards. But what coach Paul Arnold described as ‘a bad day at the office’ was followed the next week by a convincing win at home to league leaders Hull Ionians, while Hinckley have since fallen off the pace.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Thousands of mayors, climate activists and business leaders from around the world descended Thursday on San Francisco to cheer on efforts to reduce global warming, even after U.S. President Donald J. Trump signaled his disdain for the issue. The Global Climate Action Summit, organized by California Gov. Jerry Brown, included a report that 27 major cities around the world have seen emissions decrease over a five-year period and are now at least 10 percent lower than their peak. The star-studded conference included a rousing call to action by Harrison Ford, who implored the audience to protect forests, fisheries and other natural wonders.

Ahead of the second anniversary of the UK’s vote to leave the EU the Home Office has produced some answers but left many questions unaddressed. Two years ago, more than three million EU citizens in the UK were plunged into uncertainty by a referendum result that left us without a voice and with everything to lose. That’s why we set up the3million campaign to make sure EU citizens are not forgotten in eternal discussions around a customs union, border control and Galileo – the global satellite navigation system. I have lived in Britain for 25 years.
The Millennials, as a consumer group, are hard to please. From their shopping experiences, they want (and expect) it all—value for their dollars, high-quality products, authentic and honest store environments—and they want it fast. So when Atlanta-based Miller Zell partnered with Philadelphia-based Aramark’s Higher Education division to develop a new college campus c-store concept, they started by delving into research on the shopping habits of today’s college students. Ultimately, the research and project objectives culminated in the creation of a new campus c-store concept, dubbed Provisions on Demand (P.O.D.) Market.
The no-button trackpad unveiled on Apple's new MacBooks and MacBook Pros is failing to register some clicks, according to early adopters. The new glass trackpad introduced on the MacBooks unveiled by Apple last month appears to be giving some users fits. The trackpad on the new MacBooks and MacBook Pros does away with a separate button, turning the whole trackpad into the mouse button. It also supports several new multitouch gestures for rotating pictures or scrolling. But The Register notes that some users are running into problems where the MacBook doesn't register clicks on the trackpad.
Germany advertising agency Jung von Matt/Neckar did some free marketing for DHL, pulling a prank on their behalf. It seemed like worldwide shipping company DHL had pulled off an incredible advertising prank, by using other competitors shipping services and using heat sensitive ink to inscribe the words, ‘DHL is faster’ on the boxes. It turns out DHL had nothing to do with the trick, but they are certainly benefiting from the free publicity. Well-known German ad agency Jung von Matt held an internal creative competition for its staff and the DHL prank was one result.
Archives|Is Mr. Gorbachev Turning Tail? Just who is Mikhail Gorbachev? The reformer whose unconventional thinking encourages the Soviet Union to transform itself, or a pushover for reac tionaries who want him to arrogate authority and save the Union at all costs? Americans have reason to wonder, and cause for concern. But they'd be wrong to ignore the continuing revolution in Soviet society amid the moment's political machinations. Soviet reformers are themselves uncertain of what to make of Mr. Gorbachev's increasingly conservative behavior. Sensing a mood swing in Moscow, some actually applaud his efforts to restore order.

Pakistan has deployed more Chinese medium-range air defense missiles across several cities and military bases, to prevent any intrusions after the Indian Air Force carried out cross-border anti-terrorist strikes last month. Five units of LY-80 (HQ-16) surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and IBIS-150 air defense surveillance radar units were spread across Pakistan following New Delhi’s strike last month against terrorists in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan’s territory, Indian news outlets reported, citing the latest intelligence reports. Besides SAM systems, Islamabad also reportedly has deployed additional Chinese-made Rainbow CH-4 and CH-5 drones, for surveillance and even potential strikes at the Kashmir Line of Control.
A mystic healer is using star signs to tame problem pets – as Britain’s only animal astrologer. Fiona Celeste, 43, believes that animal behaviour is dictated by the zodiac in the same way as humans. Gemini dogs are sociable and enjoy travelling, Virgos enjoy their creature comforts and appreciate peace and quiet, and Scorpios make great police dogs because they are inherently nosey. Fiona is using her unique skills to diagnose and resolve behavioural issues with pets and charges £35 for a reading. Mum-of-three Fiona said: ”People want to know about their pets because they are part of the family and have their own personalities.
Wu, 21, a senior studying information sciences and technology at Penn State, is a bit young to play demigod. But his problem, the university’s problem, is an ivory Tower of Babel. As for the world-building, he’s been there and done that. Wu, like many of his like-minded peers, is in his own startup. He’s a programmer, a creator cloaked in unassuming button-downs and beaten-up New Balances. And never before has it been easier for those like him to breathe life into the ether. All it takes is a few hundred flicks of the wrist.
TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. -- The traditional means for staying fit-to-fight typically requires a balance of running, weight training and a proper diet.

Creating the right impression of your brand to the right people is critical to the success of your business; everyone in your organization is either directly or indirectly working to do this every day, regardless of job title or responsibilities.

Question 1: Who are our customers and how much do we know about them? This may seem like an obvious necessity, but actually pinning down a strong, data-supported answer to this question can be very difficult.

Whether it is the desktop computer where Microsoft’s Windows has about 90 percent market share or the company’s Office which is unarguably the best productivity suite available.
South Africa: Should Government Health Schemes Pay for Infertility Treatment? "Women are blamed for infertility when, in fact, as we know from research, it is quite often on the man's side." Infertility affects up to 180-million couples worldwide, shows new research released today. The study argues that infertility treatment should become part of basic health services offered under national health insurance schemes. Launched in Johannesburg on Wednesday, and published in The Lancet medical journal, the report outlines two years of global research into areas of reproductive health such as access to safe abortions, antenatal care and gender-based violence.
CINCINNATI — The Cougar’s watched Cincinnati place kicker Josh Pasley kick a 23-yard field goal on the Bearcat’s opening drive, but the home team would never score again as BYU sailed to a 20-3 victory on the road Saturday. It was a combination of stout defense and Quarterback Taysom Hill, who fought off a sluggish start to eventually lead BYU into the end zone. It was a 3-3 game with less than a minute left until the half when the senior quarterback scampered in from 8 yards out to give the Cougars their first lead.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) put a somewhat humorous spin on a very serious training exercise this week, asking members of the Air Force cyber unit “Ofek” to disrupt and sabotage fictitious invading alien spacecraft. The Jerusalem Post reports on the exercise, noting that it was part of increased efforts to train Israeli forces to handle and counter a growing number of cyber threats, but tailored to be more culturally relevant and interesting to a younger generation of soldiers. “The goal was to make them understand the importance developing [cyber] defense.

The United States could be prepared to -begin talks with the Soviet Union on reducing strategic nuclear weapons as early as June or July, State Department officials say. Some officials are urging that the talks be opened that soon, partly in order to offset the growing antinuclear movement in Western Europe and in the United States. But a continuing problem is the situation in Poland, which already has helped to slow the timing of such talks. One official says that there would be considerable political advantage in it for President Reagan if he could announce during his June trip to Europe that the US is ready to begin strategic arms reduction talks.
Except for the people who benefit from others’ misery — Wall Street short-sellers, pyramid schemers and prosperity gospel profiteers — the Great Recession was difficult, painful, even life-altering. But not for Rep. Jimmy Dixon, a Republican from Duplin County. The chairman of the Joint Oversight Committee on Agriculture, Environment and Natural Resources, Dixon proclaimed yesterday afternoon that the “Great Recession was a wonderful blessing.” His point was that a sudden financial belt-tightening in 2008-09 benefitted state government, turning it into a lean, mean machine, albeit one that left several departments running on fumes.
MILAN (Reuters) - British hedge fund Caius has made a payment to UniCredit (CRDI.MI) to settle a dispute over complex financial instruments which Italy’s biggest bank counts toward its core capital, the two companies said. Caius had questioned UniCredit’s CASHES securities, arguing they should not be classed as best-quality capital. “Caius intends to take no further public, legal or regulatory action in respect of UniCredit or its securities,” the firms said in a joint statement. UniCredit had filed a lawsuit against Caius in August seeking 90 million euros ($102 million) in damages.

Toyota has developed the first leisure craft in Japan powered by a parallel hybrid system. The hybrid boats will be studied in Tokyo’s waterways from July 2018 to March 2021.

Toyota is lending its hybrid boat, the Ponam-28V, to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government at no charge. According to the press release from Toyota, the government will use the boat to assist in routine maintenance of piers and other port facilities at the Port of Tokyo.
St. Cloud State hockey player Jimmy Schuldt finished as a runner-up Friday for the 2019 Hobey Baker Award. The award, which goes to the best player in NCAA Division I men's hockey, went to Cale Makar, a sophomore defenseman from the University of Massachusetts. Schuldt, who recently signed an NHL contract with the Las Vegas Golden Knights after the Huskies' season ended March 29, also was nominated last year for the award and finished in the top 10. This year, he was named one of the three finalists along with Adam Fox, a junior defenseman from Harvard University and Makar.
Given the increasing level of influence that the modern consumer wields, it is little wonder that businesses and brands have begun to pay closer attention to their behaviour. This trend is reflected in the growing sense of social responsibility among larger corporations, which mirrors the ethos of consumers who are keen to live a more sustainable lifestyle. Making your business green is no easy task, however, as it requires a long-term and unswerving commitment. Invest in Carbon Reduction Generators: Carbon reduction is the process of reducing your firm’s carbon footprint, and businesses throughout the UK are offered incentives if they achieve this.
Senior Afghan officials warned on Monday that talks this week between Taliban militants and opposition politicians, including former President Hamid Karzai, betrayed the principles of democracy and Afghanistan's best interests. The talks, starting on Tuesday in Moscow, come 10 days after peace negotiations between the United States and the Taliban in Qatar ended with signs of progress towards the withdrawal of thousands of foreign troops from Afghanistan and an end to more than 17 years of war. The push for peace comes as the Taliban, ousted by U.S.-led forces in 2001, have staged near-daily attacks and are in control of or contesting districts across nearly half the country.
DOVER, Okla. - Dover students are expected to have the rest of the week off from school after a massive fire destroyed the high school. The exact cause of the fire is still under investigation, but crews are there now and will be for the rest of the week. It's a very different story Tuesday evening after, less than 24 hours ago, Dover High School was up in flames. "We've been able to save the cafeteria, the grade school and the high school gym," said Bobby Gardner, Fire Chief of the Dover Fire Department.
Microsoft's latest shot in the anti-GPL war comes from His Billness himself and - bizarrely - likens it to a small yellow blob that starred in 1980s arcade games. Mike Ricciuti of Cnet should be given due credit for extracting this BillBlurt, in an interview conducted this week at TechEd. Protesting that Microsoft's views on open source have been "misunderstood," Gates comes up with something not so much misunderstandable as only marginally comprehensible: "But if you say to people, 'Do you understand the GPL?' (then) they're pretty stunned when the Pac-Man-like nature of it is described to them."
Richard Curtis makes romantic, sentimental and overlong comedies filled to the rafters with friends as cast members. He's a British Judd Apatow — indulgent, substituting sweetness for edge, charm for shock value. His latest, Pirate Radio, is as jolly, jaunty and sappy as Love Actually. It was cut by more than a half-hour for American release and still plays long (two hours, 35 minutes). But thanks to that fairy-dusting of Curtis charm, I wouldn't cut a frame of it. It skips along like a much-loved old LP.
Ashton Kutcher gives new meaning to the phrase, “running from your problems” — the actor has officially signed up for space travel! What’s the best way to spend $200,000 in six hours? Forget shopping sprees and Vegas slot machines — Ashton Kutcher has signed up for a seat in space, and it definitely costs a pretty penny! The Two and a Half Men actor has reserved a spot on the Virgin Galactic consumer spacecraft, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The company has been running test flights of its SpaceShipTwo, which will fly 100 kilometers above the earth’s surface for six hours.

Her onstage nemesis and acting partner Tom Ford is equally phenomenal. He powers through his Henry Higgins with an amazing energy and laser-like focus as he articulates a remarkable amount of words, while remaining funny and in his way irrepressibly charming. The supporting cast is equally wonderful. M.A. Taylor pulls out not one but two show-stoppers (three if you count his delightful scene with Ford’s Higgins where he spouts he moral philosophy) with dash and perfectly timed humor. Aled Davies is a jovial and warm Col. Pickering, who’s always in Eliza’s corner, as is Laura Perrotta as Mrs. Higgins.
If you’re like me, you’ve tried to keep your car insurance from going up by being a good driver. The rationale has been that the fewer claims you file, the less likely your rate will increase. But if you happen to be in debt, there’s a good chance your car insurance rate is on the higher end. That’s because your auto insurance and credit score are related. Auto insurers include your credit score as a factor when determining your premiums, but many motorists have yet to fully appreciate the effect their credit-worthiness has on their car insurance rates.
As host and musical guest, the doo-wop singer pulled in the show's highest ratings this season. Bruno Mars proved that he is quite the Renaissance man on Saturday night, bringing his doo-wop finesse and comedy prowess to the notoriously critical "Saturday Night Live" stage as both host and musical talent. And viewers were clearly in agreement — the episode holds the highest ratings for the show's 38th season. To celebrate, we've compiled our top three moments from Bruno Mars' stint on "SNL." The "SNL" monologue is crucial in setting the tone for the evening, and Bruno Mars killed it.
For many, the name Kes conjures a young boy with grubby, downcast eyes, his collarbone jutting out from a ragged shirt. It’s the face of the actor David Bradley, who played Billy, the working-class Yorkshire hero of Ken Loach’s 1969 film, which was based on Barry Hines’s novel of the preceding year, A Kestrel for a Knave. In this Kes, that face has aged, and wears a layer of grey stubble. Barring a couple of flashbacks, both film and book restrict themselves to a single, crushing day in Billy’s life.
When Sarsour was expected to deliver a commencement speech at City University of New York's Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, protesters including alt-right provocateurs Milo Yiannopoulos and Pamela Geller showed up to protest. While Geller and Yiannopoulos delivered speeches, Trump supporters yelled at Haredi Jews, who were there on the behalf of Neturei Karta International and in support of Palestine. In the video, Schlossberg, who claims to be Jewish, can be heard verbally attacking Rabbi Dovid Feldman, who came to support Sarsour. Schlossberg can be heard calling the rabbi a "fake Jew," and at one point gives him the middle finger.
Do you want to work for a startup? The hours are often long and a "typical day" is nonexistent, but if you really believe in what you're working towards, it can transform your career — and perhaps even lead to a startup of your own. If you want to land the job of your dream at a top startup, you need to network. At a small startup, making the right hiring decision is critical. I always reach out to my fellow founders and connections on LinkedIn before making any hiring decisions.

The New Zealand Private Equity and Venture Capital Monitor, released today, highlights a strong growth in investment in New Zealand businesses in 2017. • Mid-market investment increased to NZ$334m, twice the 10-year average of $161m. • Early-stage venture investment increased to $217m from NZ$92m in 2016. • Total investment and divestment activity across all investment stages reduced to NZ$990m from NZ$1,557m in 2016. • The average deal value at NZ$12.9m was lower than the average of NZ$18.2m in 2016 but still well above the averages over the last 10 years.
The year 2014 holds yet another chance to eliminate the harmful traditional practice of child marriage in a long struggle that has consumed the attention of gender activists, public health practitioners and human rights advocates over the past 50 years. As youth employment fails to keep pace with the continent’s teeming population growth rates and as rural economies collapse in the face of armed conflict and climate displacement, the problem of what to do with the girls of Africa is of central concern to the poor village man as it is for the global community troubled by human security.
As we start this new year, I will leave you with a simple thought: Accept what is, let go of what was, and have faith in what will be. The one thing in life that is constant is change. There are times in our lives when we choose change. Other times, change chooses us. In either case, we have to decide how we will deal with change. There are three basic approaches we can take to handling change. The first approach is to fight it. Often times, change is uncomfortable.
The oral tradition predates the written word by thousands of years. Throughout history, storytelling has provided both a creative outlet and a focus for community. The Appalachian narrative tradition has remained especially vibrant: The International Storytelling Center is based in nearby Jonesborough, Tenn. And in Asheville, gatherings and competitions in which people share their own personal stories have long been a popular draw. A relative newcomer to the local scene, Moth StorySLAMs are part of a celebrated national network. The Asheville Moth GrandSLAM brings together 10 winners of previous StorySLAMS for a competition held at the Diana Wortham Theatre, Monday, Oct. 29.

Why do the men in some families go bald, reliably, generation after generation? It’s not just bad luck. Rather, male-pattern baldness is a genetic condition affecting as many as 70% of men, and over the years different cultures have concocted an array of potential cures for it, from rubbing goose dropping into the scalp to a combination of molasses and oats that must be licked off the head by a cow. Of course, these “solutions” aren’t likely to get you far and may expose you to far worse things – goose poop, anyone?
Scott, the seventh man to walk on the moon and the first to drive on it, sued Bulova and Sterling Jewelers, formerly known as Kay Jewelers, in February 2017, saying the companies collaborated to use his persona on a timepiece commemorating the mission. The watch, which Bulova dubbed the “Special Edition Moon Chronograph,” was designed to replicate the ones worn by Scott and the other astronauts on the Apollo 15 mission to the moon in 1971. Mostly denying the jewelers’ motion for summary judgment, U.S. District Judge Nathanael Cousins said Scott may have a case that they ripped off his image and likeness.
Boutique and medium sized festivals have solidified their mark on the UK and European festival season in the last 5 years. Nic Fanciullis The Social organiser has been a key figure in flying the preverbial flag for dance music and establishing a two day extravaganza.

He’s so attractive. Love that dark hair and dark five o’clock shadow. That’s good that he’s out, but I doubt more closeted LGB actors/actresses will come out. he is also a truly phenominally gifted actor..and at the right time. i think of all the roles rupert everett should have had, tho he is a bit self-destructive. Honestly I first saw him on Tori Spellings faux-reality show which was hilarious and deserved a much longer run. I thought he was out at the time because it was so painfully obvious.
Roller Derby is hot in Buffalo. Just like hula hooping, the pastime has gone from a sleeper to a full fledged way of life for many. Over the years, the Queen City Roller Girls league has taken off, so much so that they will soon be playing at their new custom digs at Riverworks (see here). While the major roller derby league in Buffalo continues to thrive, another league is just starting to make some waves in town. Almost as quickly as Psyko established her Nickel City Renegade Rollergirls, she also found a skating rink/track to practice.
Jim Valvano’s name was officially added to the title of the historic building. Keatts looked good in all red and his Wolfpack team looked even better. Keatts wore a red suit but his shoes — black Gucci loafers with a wolf head — were the true highlight. “He was flexing,” is how guard Blake Harris, who had season-high 15 points, described his coach. Keatts was feeling good and so was the energetic crowd. PNC Arena has mostly been empty for N.C. State’s first six home games of the season.
The U.S. Postal Service has chosen 10 acres at the corner of Park Avenue and Tanglewild Road as the site for a new post office. Guy Bennett, facilities coordinator for the Orlando region postal service, said the office will be 3 1/2 times the size of the current building on U.S. Highway 441. The postal service expects to close on the deal in the next three to four weeks, Bennett said. He declined to give the price of the land. The new post office will be 20,000 square feet, compared with 6,540 square feet at the current office.

DENVER (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday dismissed lawsuits filed against the owners of a Colorado theater where 12 people were killed and 70 wounded during a screening of a Batman film in 2012, court records showed. Relatives of some of the dead victims and wounded survivors claimed in the lawsuit that theater chain Cinemark USA was negligent by not providing adequate security for its patrons. U.S. District Court Judge R. Brooke Jackson granted a motion filed by Cinemark to dismiss the case, who claimed in court that its employees could never have foreseen the actions of a "madman."
Want to know what Justin Bieber is going to be for Halloween? Well we have no clue, but here's a hint: a few weeks ago, t he diminutive pop star called on Las Angeles-based jewelry maker If & Co. to request a custom-made gold grill (the kind that fits over your teeth). We checked in with the jeweler, Ben Baller, to see what a custom grill like Bieber's would cost. His manager just got back to us and said it would cost $5,000. remember, I don't even make grills anymore unless its for someone really special.
UK regulators intend investigating Aer Lingus’s plan to take over Cityjet’s services from Dublin to London City Airport for possible breaches of competition law. Cityjet recently announced that it planned to transfer the services to Aer Lingus, but would provide the craft and crew to operate the services under an arrangement called “wet leasing”. The UK’s Competition and Markets’ Authority (CMA) says it is investigating whether the deal qualifies as a merger under that jurisdiction’s Enterprise Act and, if so, if it reduces competition for goods and services.
Archdiocese coextensive with the departments of Doubs, Haute-Saône, and the district of Belfort. Few nineteenth-century dioceses have undergone similar territorial changes. The Concordat of 1802 gave the Diocese of Besançon all those districts which, in 1822, constituted the Diocese of St. -Claude. In 1806, Besançon was given jurisdiction over the three parishes of the principality of Neufachatel (Switzerland) which fell under the control of the See of Lausanne in 1814. In 1870, after the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany, the district of Belfort was withdrawn from the See of Strasburg and attached to that of Besançon.
It was a good day for Einstein when an international collaboration of physicists announced in February that they detected ripples in space time known as gravitational waves from the collision of two gigantic black holes far far away. Neither gravitational waves nor black holes — both predictions of Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity — had been seen directly before. It was also a good day for the researchers, for whom great honors were immediately predicted. Now those predictions are coming true. On Tuesday, Yuri Milner, a Russian Internet entrepreneur and philanthropist, announced that he was giving $3 million to the gravitational-wave discoverers.

Despite fielding a team of just 15 members this spring, veteran Farmington Central boys track and field coach Jim Hardesty is looking forward to the upcoming season. Unlike last year when the Farmers won the Fulton County title and battled among the top teams in the Prairieland and at the sectional, with the team graduating a numbers of seniors, the focus for Hardesty has changed somewhat going into this season. “It’s a different style of fun,” he stated. “... The success is more individual and they’re more centered around learning and getting better day by day and meet by meet.
Earlier this week, the folks at the Warner Bros. Studio Tour invited me and a handful of other journalists to check out the newly-revamped DC Universe Exhibit, which now includes props and costumes from last year’s superhero film Justice League. Typically, they don’t allow video to be taken inside, but they lifted those restrictions for this event and let us bring our cameras inside to take a closer look. When I first moved to Los Angeles, I worked as a tour guide at Paramount Pictures. So a few years ago, I paid to take the Warner Bros.
Uma Thurman’s former fiancé Arpad Busson has filed an emergency court order seeking custody of their 2-year-old daughter. The “Kill Bill” star began dating French financier Busson in 2007 and gave birth to the couple’s only child, little Rosalind, aka Luna, in July, 2012, months after reconciling with her boyfriend following a 2009 split. The pair parted ways again earlier this year, calling off its engagement for a second time, and now multi-millionaire Busson is fighting for physical custody of his child. His lawyer filed papers in Manhattan Supreme Court in New York on Tuesday.
"Transmission Intake Filtration System" by Frank Hercinger, Beau Kidman et al. This project accomplished the design and testing of an internal oil filter for a manual transmission of a heavy-duty truck. Research was conducted in an attempt to locate a pre-fabricated filter, but the filters researched did not meet the required properties. A filter was then designed to meet the specifications of the customer. The concept design consisted of a steel rectangular cage wrapped with a stainless steel woven wire mesh. The dimensions of the filter were optimized to fill the allotted cavity of the transmission case.
Hammond battled through a myriad of injuries last season to a disappointing finish. Then, this year, the Skyhawks started off 0-4 but held things together, culminating with a state title. Myers, a Charleston Southern signee, led the Skyhawks with 14 points, and Presbyterian signee Trinity Johnson added 10. The two combined to go 11-of-12 from the free-throw line in the fourth quarter as Hammond put away any comeback attempt by Cardinal Newman. Cardinal Newman, which trailed by nine in the fourth, got as close as 33-29 with 3:20 left, but managed only one field goal the rest of the way.
Enniskillen on Wednesday, when Sir Edward Carson addressed an open-air meeting of 30,000 persons. The Government said they must be content to live under a Constitution which had never been submitted to them or to the electors of the United Kingdom. If this unprovoked and wicked attack on their civil and religious liberty were allowed to go on and the Bill became law, it was not only their right but their duty to resist it. A resolution affirming the resolve of the Ulster Convention of 1892, " We will not have Home Rule," was submitted to the meeting and passed by acclama- tion.
Government is unique in its ability to demand your money — in the form of property tax, sales tax, and fees. Government uses this money to provide public goods; streets are an example. Everyone agrees that street management is a necessary and proper role for government. In Corpus Christi, spending on existing street programs is approximately $35 million per year. It is likely that this number will grow by an additional $10 million to $20 million as a new, residential street reconstruction program is implemented. Ordinary people and businesses pause from time to time to evaluate if their own money is spent wisely.

There's no ad buy associated with them, and they only work as advertisements when bloggers embed them. Thus, we try not to grant coverage to web ads.
TORONTO (AP) — NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said he hasn’t attempted to talk to Patrick Kane while the Chicago Blackhawks star has been investigated about a about an incident involving a woman. Erie County prosecutors have postponed grand jury proceedings involving Kane, a person familiar with the investigation confirmed to the AP this week. Evidence was scheduled to be presented to jurors on Tuesday but the hearings were postponed for about two weeks, the person said. The defending Stanley Cup-champion Blackhawks are scheduled to open training camp next week at Notre Dame and no one is sure if one of their superstars will be there.
DOLTON, Ill. -- An Uber driver's last stop Monday morning turned into a nightmare when his passengers stole his car. Surveillance video shows driver Brent Carr pulling into a Citgo Station in the 14200 block of Lincoln Avenue in Dolton. Carr said he picked up three female passengers near 160th Place and Marian Drive in South Holland. “They requested that I stop at the gas station for them,” Carr said. The women requested he enter the station to get them a pack of Swishers. Seconds later, video shows the women leaving the gas station in his vehicle.
Mampong (Ash), April 3, GNA - Bosofour township, near Asante-Mampong was on Saturday thrown into a state of grief when a vehicle loaded with sachet water ran into a group of mourners at the community's cemetery, killing four on the spot.

In the ensuing confusion, the corpse, which was being conveyed to the cemetery, fell off the coffin to the ground, as pandemonium broke among those carrying it.
It's been more than a decade since Sean Parker, now a billionaire, blew up the music industry by co-founding Napster. Yet the industry is still going through a painful transition. Parker, 35, launched Napster, a music file sharing service, when he was just 19. He went on to become president at Facebook (FB) and then an investor at influential Silicon Valley firm Founders Fund. Most recently, he has focused on being a philanthropist and launched the Parker Foundation with a $600 million investment. But he hasn't abandoned his music roots.
Steve Grove is a collaborative kind of guy. Even the Minnesota state tattoo on his rib cage was a group effort. His dad, brother and brother-in-law sport the same one. "I never thought I'd get a tattoo. But doing it with your family? It's a special bond," he said. Grove — a former Google executive who's now head of Minnesota's Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) — grew up as the oldest of four kids in Northfield. The 41-year-old ran track and worked summers at his dad's landscaping business.

Concerns about teacher absenteeism in SA have been highlighted in an International Monetary Fund (IMF) working paper: "Struggling to Make the Grade: A Review of the Causes and Consequences of the Weak Outcomes of SA's Education System". IMF's senior resident representative in the country‚ Montfort Mlachila‚ and Wits PhD student Tlhalefang Moeletsi are the authors of the paper. They found that South African teachers have low levels of motivation‚ despite being relatively highly paid. It further stated that the country suffered from weak educational quality‚ regardless of the relatively high level of public spending on education.
GRAFTON—Local Senate and House candidates discussed their positions and answered questions from members of the public on school choice and charter schools at a forum in Grafton on Sept. 23. But it did not take long for the discussion at the White Church to shift to the economy and Vermont’s aging population. Windham County Senate candidates Hilary Cooke, Lynn Corum, Peter Galbraith, and Sen. Jeanette White and House candidates Chris Moore, Rep. Carolyn Partridge, and Rep. Michael Obuchowski had two minutes to state their respective positions on school choice. They responded to questions from the audience.

A US actor known for playing Joey in successful TV sitcom Friends will hit UK screens this year, as he joins Chris Evans as a co-presenter on motoring programme Top Gear. Golden Globe winning Matt LeBlanc came to prominence in 1987, when he appeared in a commercial for Heinz Tomato Ketchup. The Massachusetts-born actor went on to join the cast of Friends in 1994, playing the part of loveable dimwit Joey Tribbiani for a decade. More recently, UK audiences have seen Mr LeBlanc playing a fictional version of himself in BBC’s Episodes, a series about a British show that is adapted for the American market.
Memory Banda, 18, advocates for victims of child marriage with a member of the Malawian Parliament. Memory Banda is one of the lucky ones. The 18-year-old girl managed to escape the cycle that turns half the girls in her southern African nation into brides, and often mothers, by her age. But her sister Mercy was not so lucky. When only 11, Mercy got pregnant during a traditional sexual “cleansing ceremony” that is intended to prepare pubescent girls for womanhood and marriage. Mercy was forced to marry the man who impregnated her, but the marriage didn’t last.
The Kansas City Royals are a win away from the World Series. Take a breath, collect your thoughts, and then ponder that with a clearer mind. The Kansas City Royals are a win away from the World Series. They were built on prospects, ultimately shrewd trades and signings, and a plan that general manager Dayton Moore stuck with despite a lot of criticism from all sides. I mean, it wasn't a perfect plan, but you can't predict baseball...it's working. The madness of Dayton Moore is working. The bunts are working.
I know people who carry vintage phones. They’re not hipsters, they’re not poor, they’re just not bothered about having the latest thing because they just want to make calls and get text messages. But it’s not going to be long before every phone will be a smartphone and the Smart III could be described as a smartphone for the people. The device is Vodafone-badged but actually is manufactured by Alcatel One Touch, a member of the Alcatel family we don’t hear much about on this side of the world, and is designated the Astro.
Colombia plans to release more prisoners in return for hostages. "The government has given him all the guarantees so he can act as a facilitator to work for peace"
Granda was arrested in December 2004 after being snatched by police agents in Caracas in an operation that fuelled tensions between Venezuela and Colombia. Alvaro Uribe, the president, said in a late-night television address: "Today after midday, Rodrigo Granda was freed from prison. "The government has given him all the guarantees so he can act as a facilitator to work for peace."
University of Colorado student Kalin Puent competes in alley cat races, which simulate a day in the life of a bike messenger. He’s taking part in the Alley Cat Race in Boulder on Saturday. Every once in a while, University of Colorado student Kalin Puent rolls up to a bike rack on campus to park his fixie and someone takes note of the unique spoke card stuck in his wheel. “Someone will read it and go, ‘Yeah, I was supposed to go to that'” bike race, Puent said. “That” bike race was the winter Alley Cat Race in Boulder.
Wall-E sees the small waste compactor bot doing what he was designed for on a futuristic Earth where humans have left. It’s a lonesome life for him until he meets EVE, a high tech search robot, who’s on the hunt for signs of life. In a clever twist, John Carter’s Andrew Stanton directs and co-writes a story that plays out like a silent movie, taking influence from some of Pixar’s famous shorts, with little more than a few words spoken and most of the plot being explained through the characters actions.

A $1 million 401(k) balance is great. But don’t start spending like you’re rich. Not skiing as in snow skiing, but “spending our kids’ inheritance.” They use it in reference to splurges, such as pricey wines, cruises through Europe, second homes, or whatever strikes their fancy. They don’t feel bad about spending, because there’s little chance that they’ll spend so much that their own retirement is put at risk. It is truly their kids’ money, so why not?
For decades, immigration hard-liners have felt sidelined and taken for granted by Republican presidential candidates, left with dog whistles and policy crumbs. But Donald Trump's ascent to the top of the Republican ticket has changed their fortunes. Longtime advocates for shutting the door to new immigrants now hold crucial positions in Trump's campaign, and many feel, for the first time in recent memory, they have a candidate who is willing to speak plainly about reducing immigration flows and offers their clearest shot yet at influencing, perhaps even drastically altering, U.S. immigration policy.
Charles oversaw the school's men's and women's basketball programs. Florida A&M Deputy Athletic Director Elliot Charles is now on Clemson's staff, FAMU's athletic department confirmed Tuesday afternoon. Charles' last day was Friday. He was hired at FAMU in January of 2016. Athletic Director Milton Overton Jr. is now looking for a new second-in-command.

He said he hopes to have a new deputy in place before September.
Louis Freeh's firm has been hired to examine the university's behavior. Former FBI director Louis J. Freeh has been tapped by a special committee of the Penn State University trustees to lead an independent investigation into how the school handled allegations of sexual abuse involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. Freeh, who led the FBI from 1993 to 2001, will look at the protocols, decision-making and oversight at the University in response to the allegations, which have led to the firing of the school's president, legendary football coach and perjury charges against two top officials.
Ex-Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, pondering an independent run for President, has invited inquiry into where the billionaire coffee magnate has put his money. Schultz co-founded an investment capital group, Maveron, that put $7.5 million into for-profit Capella University in 2003, with a 2008 Securities and Exchange Commission filing revealing that Schultz owned 50,000 shares of Capella stock. The revelation, first reported by Politico, has implications back home in Seattle. Attorney General Bob Ferguson and other AGs have gone after another for-profit, Corinthian Colleges, and Ferguson has championed legislation calling for a Student Loan Bill of Rights.
An Irish aviation services company has said a new operation in Belfast that has created 124 jobs is part of its Brexit-proofing strategy. Eirtech Aviation Services, which is based at Shannon Airport in Co Clare, had considered locations in the Republic, England and Europe for its composites repair centre. But chief executive David Kerr said the high level of skills in Northern Ireland, as well as the support of Ulster University and economic development agency Invest NI, had convinced it to set up here. It has now established a centre for repairs on commercial aircraft on Queen's Road under a new limited company, Eirtech Aviation Composites.

I opened my previous three columns by posing a question to readers, so I guess I’ll do so with today’s opener. What state in the U.S. has the best hamburger shops? I would assume that most will respond California or New York. Yup. Good old Nevada. Led by Las Vegas. And the best known and most popular one in Vegas is owned by a Japanese. The next time I go to Vegas, I’ll give his hamburger place a try to see what makes it the best hamburger stand in America.
There's still a wide gap between talking about change and making it happen. Diversity in tech hasn't changed much. There's a mantra that gets tossed around in the tech industry: We want to change the world. For true believers, it's the notion that companies can create products that improve the way we live, work and play -- blasting us into a better future. But despite that idealism, Silicon Valley still faces a lack of diversity. And there's a notable disconnect between solution-oriented talking points and the pace at which companies are actually making workforces more inclusive.
Can virtual worlds create better spies? Previously, an entry in this blog explained that the agency that conducts research for intelligence agencies is interested in learning how people's performance in a virtual world or game can affect their abilities in real life. The agency, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency (IARPA), is interested in focused, quantitative research on how gaming and virtual world immersion could boost problem-solving skills, critical thinking, teamwork and persistence, according to a request for information (RFI) from that organization released in March. IARPA does research for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).
The hijacking of an EgyptAir aircraft to Cyprus recalls a previous era when hijackings were a regular occurrence. Tuesday's hijacking of an Egyptair aircraft on a domestic flight from Alexandria to Cairo took the world by surprise in part because, particularly since the September 11th attacks in the United States in 2001, security on passenger flights around the world has been substantially increased. The 1960s and 1970s saw a large number of hijackings carried out by Palestinian terrorist groups. El Al Israel Airlines quickly developed a reputation for its stringent airline safety. The first and last successful hijacking of an El Al aircraft took place in 1968.
We’ve shared news of many kinds of school fundraisers – but this is the first time we can recall one involving mattresses.

In 2007, Russia, China and the European Space Agency announced an ambitious psychological isolation experiment – an all-male crew simulation of a 520-day space mission to Mars. NASA is lining up humans to eat space food on Hawaii in a mission-to-Mars simulation. With 2012 just 10 days away, RT begins its own countdown with ten special reports on events that have shaped 2011. We are looking back at major stories through the eyes of RT correspondents who witnessed them. Members of the Mars 500 experiment who spent 17 months shut away from the world are enjoying their first few days “back on Earth”.
More nations beating UK’s stagnant school system | City A.M.
VIETNAM, Poland and South Korea are among the countries ranked higher than the UK in a major survey of the world’s education systems, released by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) yesterday. Out of 65 countries, the UK ranks just 26th in maths and 23rd in reading. In science the UK managed 21st place, the only discipline in which Britain is above average. In previous years, the UK has been ranked in the top 20 countries for at least one subject.
Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane says he is determined to create a national gas market that could theoretically send gas all the way from the Browse Basin in Western Australia to Sydney, heading off a potential gas shortage in NSW and steep price rises from 2016. In an exclusive interview with Fairfax Media, Mr Macfarlane said the missing link in creating a single national gas market could be the 1000-kilometre pipeline between Alice Springs and Moomba, South Australia, which would link up the Northern Territory to the east coast gas market and could cost about $1.3 billion, according to industry estimates.
Two national civil rights organizations filed a citizen complaint against the city of San Francisco today alleging that San Francisco police could be violating city law in their work with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Joint Terrorism Task Force. The complaint, filed with the city’s Office of Citizen Complaints (OCC) today, stems from an incident in June 2014 in which a San Francisco Police Department inspector participating in the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), attempted to gather First Amendment activity information from software engineer Sarmad Gilani.
The Buffalo Bills have completed their roster cuts. Here are the players that remain on their roster. The Buffalo Bills have completed their roster cuts — and a trade of AJ McCarron to the Oakland Raiders — and are down from 90 players to the regular season's 53-man limit. About 1,100 players are now without a team so Buffalo will still make moves to solidify it's opening day roster and form a practice squad. Any waived player who has less than four years of NFL service time must go through the waiver process, meaning he can be claimed by any team.
How long can we survive in a sealed enclosure? The average concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere is 21.0% by volume, but in polluted environments it may be lower. The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration has adopted a lower acceptable limit of oxygen in the workplace of 19.5%. At 12% a loss of consciousness is likely, although people with medical conditions may lose consciousness at 15% or even more. Question: How long can 10 healthy adult people survive in a sealed room of dimensions 3m x 4m x 2.5m before they run out of oxygen (i.e.
Beacon Power, a maker of storage devices that help the power grid , goes the way of Solyndra, drawing more scrutiny to the Energy Department's loan program.

Orlando Sentinel columnist Scott Maxwell talks to FOX 35 about the round of vetoes done by Gov. Rick Scott. Rick Scott took a wrecking ball to the state budget this week. He swung it one way and dashed UCF's dreams for a downtown campus. He swung it the other and took out the concert hall at the arts center. He swung it once more and destroyed all sorts of pet projects for legislators. My initial reaction was to applaud. While legislators were whining, I thought: Good for you, governor. I loathed the secret, late-night spending spree legislators staged to end the session.
The anticipated Capital Steez posthumous album has been on the way for over a year now, and while fans were hoping to get their ears on it before the end of 2017, it looks like that won't be happening. Joey Bada$$ gives an update on the project from the late Pro Era founder. The album was originally announced to release on Dec. 23 next week. According to the Brooklyn MC, King Steez has been pushed back due to "business legalities and sample clearances," and is being delayed until further notice.
(CN) – In the aftermath of the fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash, Boeing investors filed a class action against the aerospace company for allegedly failing to update a proxy statement filed with the Securities Exchange Commission with any details of the disaster that ultimately grounded every single Boeing 737 Max 8 jet. Lead plaintiff Jeweltex Manufacturing Inc.

Numerous executives and directors of the Chicago-based company, including CEO Dennis Muilenburg, are named as defendants.
The hacker group Anonymous has apparently responded to the attacks on Paris by posting a video declaration of war against ISIS. In the as-yet-unverified video, posted on YouTube, a spokesperson wearing the group's signature Guy Fawkes mask said the group of hackers would use its expertise to wage "war" on the militant group. "Expect massive cyber attacks. War is declared. Get prepared," the announcer says in French. "Anonymous from all over the world will hunt you down. You should know that we will find you and we will not let you go.
A Middletown woman’s guilty plea Monday to felony animal cruelty charges marked the first felony conviction in Butler County since a 2016 law change. Tina Marie Jackson, 40, was charged with the fifth-degree felonies in February after several dead dogs were found in the backyard of her home. Jackson’s guilty plea Monday to three counts of felony cruelty to companion animal came a week before her trial was scheduled to begin. The charge of cruelty to a companion animal had been a first-degree misdemeanor for years, with a maximum sentence of 180 days.

COLUMBIA, SC (WIS) - Lawmakers met to discuss medical marijuana in the Palmetto State on Tuesday. The “Compassionate Care Act” would allow doctors to legally prescribe medical marijuana for some chronic conditions. Sen. Tom Davis (R-Beaufort) and Rep. Peter McCoy (R-Charleston) spoke about their medical marijuana bills at a press conference after it was introduced on the State Senate floor. Sen. Davis said this is the most socially conservative medical marijuana bill in the country. He doesn’t want it to lay the foundation for recreation use in the state.

Gov. Deal told lawmakers that he would push for more education funding during the next year so that districts can restore instructional days, end furloughs of teachers, and boost educators' salaries—steps that he believes will help them rebound from years of economic pain. The governor, who is up for re-election this year, has been criticized by political opponents who accuse him of having not done enough to help districts stave off recession-driven budget cuts. But Mr. Deal said he had protected districts from deep cuts through the state's funding formula, while keeping taxes in check.
Four people died in a fiery, head-on collision near Lake Mathews Saturday morning, March 16, the California Highway Patrol said. The collision occurred at about 5:10 a.m. between a 2001 GMC Sierra heading westbound on Cajalco Road east of Gavilan Road and a 2006 Chevy Avalanche, eastbound on Cajalco Road, approaching the GMC, CHP spokesman Dan Olivas said in a news release.

Parasport or disability sport is played by people with physical and intellectual disabilities and has existed for more than 100 years. Parasport is generally divided into three broad disability groups: deaf people, people with physical disabilities and people with intellectual disabilities. Each group has its own history, organisation and approach and each group has made significant contributions to what is considered modern-day parasport. In the 19th Century, research into parasport proved sporting activity was very important for the re-education and rehabilitation of people with a disability although it was not until 1924 that the first deaf sport - the 'Paris Silent Games' - took place.
The economic fallout from the nation's housing crisis continues to be geographically concentrated. New figures on foreclosure rates for 2010 from RealtyTrac show that Sunbelt metros continue to see the highest levels of foreclosure in the nation. Miami tops the list with more than 171,704 foreclosures followed by Phoenix with 124,720 and Riverside with 101,210. The map above prepared by Zara Matheson of the Martin Prosperity Institute shows the 20 metros with the highest total number of foreclosures based on the RealtyTrac data. And, 19 of the 20 metros with the highest foreclosure rates are located in just three Sunbelt states -- Nevada, California, and Florida.
Local and federal officials said Saturday that progress is being made in Puerto Rico to restore water, gasoline and communications to the hurricane-battered island, as President Donald Trump railed on Twitter against "fake news" and defended recovery efforts. Only five percent of the island has electricity service as of Saturday, 10 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall as a strong Category 4 storm, wrecking infrastructure and communications on the U.S. territory, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. "This was a catastrophic storm. We're making progress every day," FEMA acting regional administrator for region II John Rabin told reporters Saturday.
People often ask me the secret behind my hair colour but I’m afraid my hairdresser won’t even tell me his secret! I can give you a clue though… ask your hairdresser for copper rather than red if you want to get a similar colour to mine. My natural hair colour is medium brown but I’ve had it copper for a while now and I love it. I used to get highlights and it would come through as red in a certain light which I wasn’t too sure about but now I really embrace the reddish tones.
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) - New Indiana coach Archie Miller intends to win the in-state recruiting battles and bring back a defense-first philosophy to the tradition-rich program. Two days after being hired, Miller spoke to a crowd that included Hoosiers' players and fans gathered inside Assembly Hall. Miller made it clear he would emphasize recruiting Indiana's best talent, attacking on offense and playing nasty defense - three components Indiana fans desperately wanted to hear. Athletic director Fred Glass also confirmed Miller's seven-year deal will average about $3.5 million. The contract has not yet been signed.
The team that worked on developing Volvo&apos;s four-seat "Your Concept Car" sedan poses for a photo at the New York International Automobile Show. The vehicle is unique in that the design team was composed entirely of women. Refilling the window-washer fluid is done through an opening behind the driver side door, so there&apos;s no need to open the hood. The YCC does include a few feminine touches. Small compartments in the ceiling were designed to store sunglasses and tissues, and the seat covers and floor mats come in a variety of colors and textures.
A majority in the European Parliament has approved Jean-Claude Juncker to be President of the European Commission, reports BBC. He got 422 votes out of the 729 total cast in the secret ballot, despite strong opposition earlier from Britain. Juncker got well over the 376 votes minimum that he needed. There were 250 votes against him, 47 abstentions and 10 spoilt ballots. A firm believer in EU integration, the former Luxembourgh Prime Minister will succeed incumbent Jose Manuel Barroso of Portugal in November. In a speech to MEPs, he pledged the Commission would be a "political body", not just Europe's civil service.
Fans of Bollywood movies in Pakistan will not be able to watch an Indian blockbuster starring a homegrown actor after the country’s film board banned the movie for its apparently unflattering depictions of Muslims. Indian films are enormously popular in Pakistan but Raees had been particularly hotly anticipated as it features Shah Rukh Khan, one of India’s most popular male leads, and Mahira Khan, a Pakistani star making her first appearance in a major Indian production. But on Tuesday the chairman of the Pakistan’s film censors said the country’s cinemas would not be allowed to screen the movie.
We’re still a little over a month away from seeing what will take place in the second half of The Walking Dead Season 6, but now we can start anticipating the debut of companion series Fear the Walking Dead Season 2, as it will be premiering a lot sooner than we expected.

FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. - The 101st Airborne Division is trying to save its illustrious 506th Infantry Regiment, whose origins date to World War II's fabled "Band of Brothers," from deactivation under the Army's massive restructuring. The Army announced this week that at least 12 combat brigades nationwide are to be eliminated by 2017 under sweeping military reductions, among them the 4th Brigade Combat Team at Fort Campbell, Ky. The brigade traces its lineage to the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, created in 1942, at Camp Toccoa, Ga. The 506th was among several parachute regiments created to sneak behind enemy lines in the war.
As Congressman Dave Camp’s big line goes, the United States’ tax code is ten times the size of the Bible, but with none of the Good News. When someone whose signature riff laments the length of tax laws attempts to remedy the situation, you’d expect his fix to be the soul of brevity. The fact that Camp’s newly released proposal clocks in at nearly 1,000 pages makes one wonder if the right problem is being addressed. As Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Camp has undertaken a worthy task in issuing a new discussion draft on tax reform.
As anyone who has seen the film will tell you, Grave Of The Fireflies is sad as hell. Adapted for the screen and directed by the recently deceased Isao Takahata, the story follows two siblings in Japan during World War II who struggle to survive on their own after their home city of Kobe is destroyed by incendiary bombs. It’s the kind of movie you might watch because you’re starting to get into anime and think to yourself, “These Studio Ghibli movies are always pretty fun!” Next thing you know, your soul has been broken in two and you can’t stop crying.
FORT SILL, Okla. (March 1, 2018) -- You stand at the doorway as you wait for the signal. From where you stand on the staircase, you grip your M4 between both hands as you peer into the dark hallway. An explosion sounds from a distance and your time starts. Dressed in full combat gear, you and a teammate rush into the long hallway and run toward a room with flickering lights. As you approach the room, the sounds of explosions, gun shots, and cries of terror grow louder. "I was nervous," said Spc.
dripping from the wasps’ nest. There is something that has to be said for the ambrosial pleasure derived out of watching raindrops fall in an eclectic pattern all around you. The tangible sensuality and the magical reality of the moment predispose a sense of romanticism in even the most unpoetic of people. Since time immemorial rains have evoked a myriad emotions in all and sundry. Be it a soft pitter-patter, a constant drizzle or a deluge, rain in all its avatars has inspired the imaginative and the not-so-imaginative among us to pen down our deepest feelings without a further thought.
The East of England’s biggest water company has reported a strong financial performance in preliminary results despite “operational challenges”. Anglian Water says revenue for the year ending March 31 2018 was up 1.8% to £1.25bn. Operating profit was down 4.6% to £384.5m, but the group attributed this to an “increase in operational activity and expenditure”. Its annual report celebrated efforts made to improve transparency and trust, such as becoming the first water company to offload its subsidiary in the Cayman Islands from its financial structure and changing its board structure to having a majority of independent non-executive directors.
Keselowski on Stewart: Earlier this week an Ontario County (N.Y) district attorney announced he would let a grand jury decide whether Tony Stewart should be charged with a crime after Stewart’s sprint car struck and killed fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr.
That decision didn’t sit well with fellow Sprint Cup driver Brad Keselowski. He’ll answer to whatever you call him: Sprint Cup driver Aric Almirola never gets offended by the constant mispronunciations of his name. It started happening when he was in kindergarten, so he expects it now.
(CBS/KTHV/AP) JONESBORO, Ark. - The West Memphis Three, a group of men convicted of killing three 8-year-old Cub Scouts and dumping their bodies in an Arkansas ditch changed their pleas Friday, resolving a year-long effort to win their freedom. Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley and Jason Baldwin agreed to a legal maneuver that lets them maintain their innocence while acknowledging prosecutors likely have enough evidence to convict them. They were freed immediately after the plea. In 1994, the men were convicted of killing Steve Branch, Christopher Byers and Michael Moore a year earlier and leaving their naked bodies in a ditch in West Memphis, Ark.
When former monk Andy Puddicombe announced his idea to teach mindfulness with an app, his Tibetan Buddhist teacher was horrified. "I felt very unsure as well," says Puddicombe, cofounder of LA-based Headspace. "In the Tibetan tradition, there's an unbroken oral lineage from teacher to student of almost 900 years. There's a risk in scaling something like this, taking it out of its environment, diluting it." Puddicombe took the plunge and cofounded Headspace in 2010 with Rich Pierson, a former employee of creative agency BBH.
Police have launched a new service to allow people to text 999. North Yorkshire Police have launched a service to allow those who find themselves in an emergency to text 999. The new service caters for people with hearing or speech impairments as well as those who simply aren't in a position to make calls. It's free to access and available to all, however, people need to register first. Police have pointed out that this should only be used when there is a genuine emergency, such as a threat to life or if a crime is taking place right now.
November 27, 2018  In a quest to rapidly advance its scientific depth and breadth, China is recruiting scientists from around the world. Some from the U.S. say the greater funding for school and research is freeing. September 4, 2018  Nearly 17 million students head to college this fall. About half are financially independent from their parents, and nearly 1 in 4 is a parent caring for a child. February 8, 2017  Research shows that many college students across the country are working, borrowing and still falling behind.
The deals aren’t just at the malls and big box stores on Black Friday this year. If you’re house hunting, there are some deep discounts out there, especially if your income is a little higher than the Kmart crowd. Here’s are the biggest markdowns in Seattle, courtesy of Seth Kolloen at estately.com. This condo at 1000 1st Ave. was originally listed at a whopping $13,495,000. Not bad for a 2 bedroom, 2.5 bath condo. Oh, the asking price might have had something to do with the location.
The Green Bay Packers have found their new head coach in Mt. Pleasant native Matt LaFleur. Numerous media outlets were reporting that the Packers had hired LaFleur on Monday night, one day removed from his interview with the team. The 39-year old Mt. Pleasant High School graduate replaces Mike McCarthy who was fired on Dec. 2 after 13 years as head coach. LaFleur, a 1998 Mt. Pleasant graduate, takes over a team that went 6-9-1 in 2018. He comes to Green Bay after a one-year stint as the offensive coordinator for the Tennessee Titans.
It was a relatively quiet week for life sciences news. But we nevertheless saw some interesting developments in personnel moves and fund-raising, as some key local scientists helped start a couple of new companies, as well as in the clinical test of a new experimental cancer drug. —The Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) has named H. Martin Seidel as the permanent replacement for the chemist Peter Schultz, who was the institute’s founding director. Seidel, who was second-in-command during Schultz’s tenure, has served as interim director of GNF since Schultz stepped down in March.
Doctors have long known that separating families and other traumatic events can damage children's well-being. More recent research has shed some light on how that may happen: Severe early adversity may cause brain changes and "toxic stress," resulting in lasting psychological and physical health problems. A "zero-tolerance" immigration policy announced this spring by the Trump Administration has separated 2,300 children from the adults they were traveling with and sent them to shelters and foster homes across the country, according to the government. The administration has 30 days to reunite families, but it remains unclear whether it can meet that deadline.

Former LSU cornerback Tyrann Mathieu knows he can’t hide his past from the NFL. So he’s not going to try. Matthieu said at the NFL Scouting Combine that he knows his troubled past will make his interviews with teams the most important thing he does. Mathieu admitting to having been through rehab and counseling for the drug problems that marked his LSU departure. He said he woke up at 4 a.m. for a drug test today, and knows he cost himself “millions” with his past problems. And he said that NFL teams will know all about that record when he meets with them.
MTNaina Yeltsina at the opening of an exhibit dedicated to her late husband. “Mikhail Gorbachev. Perestroika,” which is housed in a mammoth space in the Manezh exhibition hall near the Kremlin, offers a spirited defense of the leader and his revolutionary economic and social reforms. The exhibit’s opening featured Gorbachev, his daughter Irina and granddaughter Ksenia, and public luminaries including Mosfilm director Karen Shakhnazarov and musician Andrei Makarevich. Gorbachev expressed the exhilaration he felt during perestroika’s early stages, as Soviet citizens were granted the right to vote in free elections and travel abroad.
As of July 2018, the world’s population is 7.63 billion. More than half of all people around the globe live in just seven countries. While Muslims are still a relatively small share of Europe’s population (roughly 5%), they are set to continue rising as a percentage of Europe’s population. Read a Q&A with Conrad Hackett, associate director of research and senior demographer at Pew Research Center, on estimating the European Muslim population. Take a look at 10 recent findings on demographic trends, ranging from global refugee and migrant flows to changes to family life and living arrangements.
ST JOHN’S, Antigua, December 24, 2008 – A flow control system implemented by air traffic controllers at the VC Bird International Airport in Antigua has been disrupting flights in and out of the island during the Christmas rush. Airlines have reported having to delay and cancel flights since the reduced pace of air traffic clearances due to what the workers say is an increase in flights during this Yuletide season. And while the slowdown comes amidst calls from air traffic controllers for a pay increase, they have insisted the move is not industrial action.
Around 80 people attended a politically charged Save Our NHS Leicestershire public meeting on 6 April to discuss the planned reorganisation of Leicester's hospitals. Speaking at the meeting was Sally Ruane, a local health policy academic and NHS campaigner, and Mark Wightman, the Director of Communications and Strategy for the local NHS Trust. But the speakers were not the main attraction. For about an hour, the audience bombarded the Trust's representative with story after emotional story about the devastating effects of NHS cuts and the woeful level of care in the community.
The first Nvidia Shield was a gaming handheld. The second was a powerful Android tablet. Now, Nvidia's going full game console. The new Nvidia Shield is a $200 set-top-box running Android TV, but it's more than that. It's a game console poweful enough to play a port of Crysis 3. And at first blush, it sure feels like a solid piece of kit. The first device to boast Nvidia's new Tegra X1 processor, the Shield is as angular as you'd expect from an Nvidia-built machine.
It’s often difficult to break through the noise of a presidential election and see real reform ideas, but through the accusations and trivial banter, if you look carefully this year, both presidential candidates have shown flashes of real substance; most notably on the importance of E-Verify, in the greater discussion of immigration reform. It is the one part of the entire policy debate over ‘comprehensive immigration reform’ where all Americans of all political persuasions are relatively on the same page. E-Verify is the government system that allows employers to verify that an employee is authorized to work in the United States.

Looking back nearly 60 years and ranking the one-hit wonders, pop outliers and funky jams reveals how the season's most massive singles share two essential elements: sincere emotion and a touch of novelty. Fun Fact: Sting joined 112, Evans and Puff Daddy to perform the track live at the 1997 Video Music Awards. Fun Fact: "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You" lost the best original song Academy Award to "Beauty and the Beast" (a Hot 100 top 10 for Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson).
Advocates for government accountability were alarmed to learn Gov. Jared Polis was undecided on whether to veto a bill to expand police transparency in Colorado. But Polis spokeswoman Maria De Cambra set the record straight late Wednesday. The signing is slated for 10:50 a.m. Friday at the Capitol, and it will be open to media, De Cambra said. Polis is allowed to wait 10 days to sign bills, which gives him until Saturday in this case. In an earlier call Wednesday, De Cambra had said that the governor was still undecided.
ESPN has fired Adnan Virk, according to a report from Andrew Marchand in the New York Post. Virk is accused of leaking confidential company information to the media on multiple occasions, according to sources. When ESPN investigated the allegations, it felt that Virk failed to fully cooperate. He recently signed a new multi-year contract. “Adnan Virk no longer works at ESPN,” ESPN vice president Josh Krulewitz told The Post. Virk could not immediately be reached for comment. On Friday, Virk was escorted off the Bristol campus. The specific nature of the information Virk chose to share is unknown at this time.
When my boys were in elementary school, their science teachers launched a program in the cafeteria called the ORT Report, in which the students measured their food waste. The goal was to cut down on their environmental footprint. According to the dictionary, an ort is “a morsel left at a meal.” The kids measured their orts by scraping their plates into bins lined up at the back of the cafeteria. There were bins designated for food waste, recycling, silverware and plates. The children then weighed the bin of food waste and graphed it on a large chart in the cafeteria.
For better or worse, the Bills' immediate future is largely in the hands of their most inexperienced players from today in their home opener and onward. Management is convinced it drafted well and the galling near miss against the Patriots last Monday night provided some evidence that it is more than wishful thinking. None of the draftees had a Rookie-of-the-Year debut, but there was wholesale evidence of helpful contributions. The contributions arrived mostly in bits and pieces, but they came from the team's first six selections in the draft. The Bills would not have borne the look of winners for 58 minutes without them.
Being able to read and write is the most basic foundation of knowledge accumulation and further skill development. Without literacy, there can be no quality education. Presently, 1 in 5 adults is illiterate, two-thirds of whom are women. At the current pace, over 700 million adults worldwide will still not be able to read in 2015. In global education discussions, literacy rates are most often reported for adolescents and adults, an ex post facto measure of the failure of primary school systems to impart basic skills in the most formative schooling years.
The Wall Street Journal will start to look more like its mainstream rival The New York Times on Dec. 4 when it puts out the first issue of WSJ., its weekend lifestyle magazine supplement, edited by Deborah Needleman. WSJ. has covered the intersection of fashion and business since it launched two years ago. But the first issue of Needleman, the former chief editor of Domino who also heads up Off Duty, the Journal’s new weekend lifestyle section, broadens the fashion coverage to help deepen the magazine’s appeal with female readers and fashion advertisers.
REAL MADRID club officials are reportedly being sent to London in a bid to sound out Chelsea star Eden Hazard. The La Liga champions wanted to snap up Monaco sensation Kylian Mbappe. However, securing his signature is proving to be hugely expensive. Monaco are demanding at least £165m to part with their prized asset. And, according to Spanish news outlet Don Balon, tax payments could push Real’s outlay to over £200m. Given the huge potential cost of bringing Mbappe to the Bernabeu, Perez has given the green light to alternative options.
Oct. 11 (UPI) -- A North Carolina family has some new pets after going to a local Kmart to try on snow boots and discovering a mother mouse and her babies. Shasta Riederer said she took her sons, Talon and Deakon, to shop for snow boots this week at the Kmart store in Bismarck, where one of the boys made a shocking discovery inside a boot in the store's shoe section. "He goes, 'Mom, look,'" Shasta Riederer told WDAY-TV. "I thought it was Vienna sausages rolling around the floor until they started moving, but then we heard them squeaking."
Huge rainfall totals and river power combined to cut through weak glacial settlements. A rash of severe tornadoes in 2013 has some people wondering whether changes in the climate can affect the strength of twisters. A category 5 typhoon slammed into the Philippines this morning, the fifth such storm of 2013. One Year After Sandy, Has Anything Changed? Cities and states hammered by Sandy have tried to guard against the next big one but with mixed results. Investigators offer lessons on the June 2013 fire and its aftermath, but avoid placing blame. What Happened at Yarnell Hill?
JEFFERSON CITY (AP) - Republican Gov. Matt Blunt's administration is requiring the office of Democratic Attorney General Jay Nixon to get its approval before spending additional money from a settlement with a prescription drug benefits company. Blunt's administration commissioner, Larry Schepker, said Thursday that it appears Nixon's office deliberately deposited a settlement check from Caremark in the wrong state account and has been spending money from it. Nixon's office claimed that Schepker's move was political and that Blunt's administration already has processed the expenses it is now questioning. Nixon is running for governor, though Blunt is not seeking re-election this year.
You should get an honorary degree in blocking out the haters. 1. You despise talking on the phone. After doing it all day, you really just want your friends to text you about plans. 2. You are exceptionally good at keeping your cool. 3. You are no longer surprised at the depths of stupidity humans can sink to. 4. You never forget the joy that is putting an annoying customer on hold. And maybe you still do this to your friends every so often. "Oh, you don't know where you want to meet tonight?
For Jasmine Burton, there's more to toilets than just poop: toilets save lives. Burton is the founder of Georgia-based charity Wish for WASH, an organisation that wants to tackle taboos surrounding sanitation. "We don't recognise toilets and all they do for us," she says. “But because of a lack of sanitation, 2,000 children die every day”. Through innovative and human-centred design, Wish for WASH hopes to change this prognosis. In 2011, whilst studying product design at Georgia Technology Institute, Burton attended a talk by Susan Davies, the director of Improve International, that changed her career path completely.
Grade 7 students at the Richard Ishmael Secondary School (RISS) have been connected to peers in three other countries – Pakistan, Turkey and the United States, as part of an international educational project facilitated by the University of Guyana (UG) through a partnership with the US based non-profit organisation, One World Youth Project (OWYP). OWYP partners with universities and engages university students as global leaders to build mutual respect and understanding among youth to positively impact their local communities. The objective is to provide youth with the global life skills needed for success in the 21st century.
Imagine an entire festival dedicated to celebrating GIFs. Next month, Singapore's holding a large outdoor GIF festival, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the GIF. Best of all, 50 selected GIFs will play in a mesmerising loop on large screens, as workshops and exhibitions go on. The organisers, the National Arts Council's Noise and kult Singapore, told Mashable that 500 GIF submissions flowed in from designers here, created just for GIF Fest 2017. Ho says this GIF was made with Photoshop, compiled from images and videos found online.
According to information released this week by the Ohio Department of Public Safety, Crawford County had 270 deer-vehicle collisions last year, a rise of 13 percent over 239 reported in 2013. There were 245 reported in 2012. In Morrow County, there were 199 car-deer collisions reported in 2014, a decrease of 10.8 percent from the 223 crashes reported in 2013. Richland County had the second-highest total in the state, with 510 reported in 2014, 511 reported in 2013 and 535 reported in 2012. Knox County had 300 crashes, an 11.5 percent increases from the 265 crashes reported in 2013.
Kevin Joseph was allegedly abducted from his relative’s house in Kottayam and his body was found in a stream in neighbouring Kollam on Monday morning. A day after the newly-married Kevin Joseph (23) was found dead in a stream, Kerala police on Tuesday arrested the brother and father of the wife Neenu from north Kerala while they were trying to flee to Bengaluru. Neenu’s brother Shanu Chacko -- the main accused -- and her father Chacko -- another accused in the case -- were arrested from Iritty in Kannur district, police said.
FLEMING ISLAND – As soon as Talan Hausman learned his best friend had cancer, the 11-year-old started creating pictures of fish. As long as Ian Bailey continues to fight his disease, Talan plans to keep drawing. His pencils and paints have been busy since Ian’s constant knee pain was later diagnosed on Feb. 17 as Osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer. Immediately, Talan decided he won’t stop drawing until Ian is cancer-free. “A year ago, I didn’t like to draw,” Talan said. “But I do like fish.
It's been said numerous times over the past several months that Captain Marvel will be the Marvel Cinematic Universe's strongest superhero, but Brie Larson may have just confirmed it by stating that character can "move planets." Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige revealed earlier this week that Carol Danvers will be the new face of the MCU for Phase 4 and beyond, leading to questions as to how Captain Marvel will fit into the upcoming Avengers 4. We already know that she'll have a significant role to play, but details are obviously under wraps for now.
COLONIAL HEIGHTS - Local veterans hosted a dinner as part of a send-off ceremony for Fort Lee soldiers heading to Afghanistan. Members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States Robert E. Lee Post #239 hosted a pre-deployment dinner on Oct. 23 at the post home. The VFW post also presented an adoption certificate to the 54th Quartermaster Company, Mortuary Affairs, which is the unit deploying overseas. This is the second year that the VFW post has adopted the 54th Quartermaster Company. The 54th is one of two mortuary affairs units on Fort Lee that are constantly deploying in support of the Overseas Contingency Operations in Kuwait and Afghanistan.
(Newser) – Three Republican state senators in Idaho skipped the chamber's daily invocation yesterday because they objected to the guest chaplain's religion. The three didn't take their seats until after Hindu cleric Rajan Zed had finished his prayer, which focused on selflessness, the AP reports. "Hindu is a false faith with false gods," said Sen. Sheryl Nuxoll. "I think it's great that Hindu people can practice their religion, but since we're the Senate, we're setting an example of what we, Idaho, believe."
Heather Franklin could spend at least seven years in prison for her role in conspiring with her husband, Ernest, to murder their 16-year-old adopted son, Jeffrey. The couple tried to conceal the killing by setting fire to their Chenango County home. On Tuesday, the day before her trial was set to begin, Heather Franklin pleaded guilty in Chenango County Court to felony counts of first-degree manslaughter, third-degree arson and tampering with physical evidence. She's facing consecutive prison terms for all three charges, which could add up to 11 years behind bars.
The next battleground in high-speed networking is likely to bring the benefits of an office network to sprawling telecommunications layouts. Think of it as a newly built superhighway with nearly limitless lanes for traffic. The next battleground in high-speed networking is likely to bring the benefits of an office network to sprawling telecommunications layouts, lowering the costs of being in the communications business. Cisco Systems, Extreme Networks, Foundry Networks and others are using their expertise in Ethernet, a popular technology used to connect PCs in the office, to come out with new lower-cost hardware that telecommunications service providers can use to offer fast Internet access at cheap prices.
Amy Winehouse’s first posthumous song “Cherry Wine” on Nas’ upcoming studio album has surfaced in the UK. Although it’s a collaboration with the rapper, it has a distinctly jazzy sound. The track, produced by long-time Winehouse collaborator Salaam Remi, premiered on BBC Radio 1 and has a slot on her tenth studio album, titled Life is Good. This is the Nas’ tenth studio album and the song is the latest to feature Winehouse posthumously. It follows her Lioness: Hidden Treasures album released on last December by Island Records.
I use pop culture to discuss these issues and how they affect my life. I’m not sure I could mentally handle writing about race, politics, and gender directly. Using film, television, and comics as a lens provides a bit of a buffer. But lately I have been fatigued by being so open about my struggles with bipolar disorder and anxiety. Which I used to discuss more openly on social media. Sometimes I forget that the editors or people who don’t know me personally may take things the wrong way.

A 29-year-old town man was arrested just over a quarter-mile away from the scene. STOUGHTON — A town man was arrested about a quarter-mile away from where police say he caused a crash, then fled from the scene. Police and firefighters responded to the area of Park and Kinsley streets for a report of a hit-and-run crash about 4:25 p.m. on Tuesday. "When the crash came in, it was reported one of the drivers took off on foot," said police Lt. John Bonney. "The description given over the radio was a male with jeans and a gray hoodie running down Kinsley Street toward Washington Street."

Toronto manager John Farrell likes Kyle Drabek's ability to "reach back and get a strikeout when he needs it." Drabek struck out five and allowed five hits over five innings against Boston yesterday in a matchup of sons of former All-Stars. He left with a one-run lead before Jeremy Hazelbaker's two-run homer in the seventh gave the Red Sox a 3-2 victory in a game shortened to 7 1/2 innings by rain. Toronto manager John Farrell likes Kyle Drabek's ability to "reach back and get a strikeout when he needs it."
The controversial disorder known as Gulf War illness may have been caused by chemicals used in pesticides and anti-nerve gas pills. In an article published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, University of California, San Diego military health researcher Beatrice Golomb reviewed 115 studies on Gulf War illness, also known as GWI. Approximately one in three veterans of the Persian Gulf War have reported lingering health problems associated with GWI, from neuropathic pain and loss of muscle control to chronic fatigue and forgetfulness. The root – or roots – of GWI haven't been conclusively determined.
"Chagall, Lissitzky, Malevich: The Russian Avant-Garde in Vitebsk, 1918-1922"
(Sept. 14-Jan. 6) — Through some 160 works, "Chagall, Lissitzky, Malevich: The Russian Avant-Garde in Vitebsk, 1918-1922" presents the artistic output of Marc Chagall, El Lissitzky, Kazimir Malevich and others, exploring a little-known chapter in the history of modernity and the Russian avant-garde. The exhibit traces the fascinating post-revolutionary years when the history of art was shaped in Vitebsk, where one hundred years ago Chagall was appointed Fine Arts Commissioner, far from Russia’s main cities.
Sir, – It’s been 50 years since the horror of starvation in Biafra played nightly across black-and-white televisions in Ireland. Fifty years since an ordinary Dublin couple, John and Kay O’Loughlin Kennedy, started “Africa Concern” in their living room and, in doing so, defied the odds to make a difference. 1968 was a very different time in Ireland, when only the church or State managed anything of scale and yet, despite having no experience, John and Kay mounted a fundraising campaign that went on to raise the equivalent of €60 million.
HAMILTON – Some staff members in the Hamilton Schools may be allowed to have guns on campus provided they are fully trained. And students may be subjected to more unannounced, random searches with portable metal detectors – wands – beginning with the upcoming school year. Hamilton joins Butler County’s Madison and Edgewood schools in those efforts as school security moves to the forefront locally and nationally following increasing numbers of school shootings – CNN reported 23 school shootings through the end of May, just this year. Staff members would only be allowed to have guns on school grounds after undergoing the same firearms training police receive, said Superintendent Larry Knapp.
Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, are a very cool innovation. They allow you to remain anonymous online and bypass restrictions imposed by media giants to let you access an unimaginable amount of content and this is just the tip of the iceberg. The truth is that VPNs are a tool with the power to do incredible things, however, not a lot of people really understand the details about their functioning. If you’re a common VPN user, then you must be familiar with the term ‘encryption’. But do you really know what it means in terms of computer systems?
Johnny Cash was arrested in October 1965 when U.S. Customs agents found hundreds of pep pills and tranquilizers in his luggage. The Man in Black--who was returning by plane from a trip to Juarez, Mexico--spent a night in the El Paso jail, and later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count. Cash paid a $1000 fine and received a 30-day suspended sentence. Submitted by Watsons Pills on Mon, 2011-04-04 23:02. Submitted by roydawgg on Mon, 2010-11-15 02:56.

Denmark’s TV 2 is using a mix of hard set, virtual set extensions and augmented reality to create a dynamic, flexible and eye-catching look for its World Cup coverage. The basic framework of the network’s studio, which includes sleek curved elements and hexagons inspired by the pattern on European footballs, is real. However, the set includes multiple built-in green screen segments that are replaced digitally by virtual set extensions. These extensions range from cityscape-style imagery in the “windows” that wrap around the space to two larger panels designed to mimic larger video walls.
But Clark was never foolish enough to claim—as so many self-deluding pop stars do—that the songs are out there in the ether waiting to be captured by the right antenna. Those pop stars failed, he knew, to recognize the sudden appearance of inspiration as the prompting of their own subconscious. And by pretending that the songs arrived already finished, those lazy pop stars rationalized their unwillingness to do the work of crafting an inspiration into a finished song. “I work on songs all the time,” he told me. “I still work on songs that were written 20 years ago.
KALAMAZOO, MI -- Kalamazoo police are collecting warm coats, hats and gloves for the area’s neediest families. Bring new or gently used winter coats to any Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety station before Friday, Dec. 21, to help those who might go without this cold season.

Crosstown Parkway. Pastors on Patrol partners with interdenominational clergy to assist with community members.
NEW UNDERWOOD, S.D. (AP) - It’s football playoff day at New Underwood. High schoolers are wearing purple and white football jerseys and cheerleader outfits in a computer lab, but down the hallway in Stacy Finkbeiner’s sixth-grade physical education classroom, it’s all business as a student in back sets down his blaze orange cap and takes out a pencil as the hunting exam is passed back to him. He fist pumps in the air. Eagerness to join moms and dads, older siblings and grandparents in the pheasant fields of South Dakota is common for students here.
Help may soon be on the way for poor parents struggling to cover diaper costs. Brooklyn City Councilman Mark Treyger plans to introduce a bill Thursday that would require the city to provide free diapers at childcare centers, shelters and other government facilities. “This is a very basic needs item,” said Treyger, a Democrat who represents Coney Island and Bensonhurst. Under the bill, the Department of Citywide Administrative Service would send diapers to centers that combat domestic violence, early childhood programs administered by the Department of Education and shelters. Only parents eligible for services at those facilities would be eligible for the freebies.
Wendell Pritchett, 87, a classical pianist, public school teacher, and father of the University of Pennsylvania’s first African American provost, died Saturday, April 6, at the hospice at the University of Pennsylvania. The cause was complications related to Alzheimer’s disease, his son, also named Wendell, said. He was born April 22, 1931, in Philadelphia and grew up in Darby, according to his family. He graduated from Temple University with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in music before receiving a doctorate in music education from Pennsylvania State University.
By her own admission, Charlotte Vega usually has no idea where she is. Thursday comes just three days after our interview and she confesses that by then she will either be in Barcelona, near where she lives, or in London for work. She is awaiting confirmation, the kind of last-minute green light that can come with a screen-acting career. A star on the Spanish small-screen, the Madrid-born 24-year-old is now breaking into markets beyond the Iberian Peninsula. When work slowed down following Spain’s economic crash, she decided to get a UK agent.
Not long after Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott announced he had sued Sony BMG over its invasive copy-protection scheme, the Electronic Frontier Foundation said it filed a class action lawsuit against the record label in Los Angeles. The EFF's suit goes beyond the rootkit and includes SunnComm DRM used by Sony as well. While acknowledging that Sony has taken steps to recall CDs affected by First 4 Internet's rootkit DRM, known as XCP, the EFF says "these measures still fall short of what the company needs to do to fix the problems caused to customers."
Last night, someone at SOBs attempted to sneak attack iLOVEMAKONNENwhile he was on stage performing his smash hit "Tuesday." In the footage, which can be seen above, the person is seen approaching the stage at the beginning of the clip, when he then reaches out to dap up Makonnen, who returns the favor, not knowing the guy&apos;s real intentions. The guy was able to bring Makonnen down to the ground and get a punch in before security and his crew jumped on him and chased him to the other side of the venue.
The chair of the bank that almost bankrupted Ireland has walked free from a Dublin court after being acquitted of misleading auditors about multimillion-euro loans. Seán Fitzpatrick was once head of the country’s biggest bank, Anglo Irish, which ended up requiring a €30bn (£26bn) government bailout and sent the country cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund for support. But on Wednesday, after the longest criminal trial in Irish history, a judge ordered the jury to acquit him on all charges. Twenty-four hours earlier Mr Justice John Aylmer had told jurors he was going to direct them to acquit Fitzpatrick.

Everton produced a remarkable end to the transfer window as they made three significant additions to Marco Silva’s squad in Yerry Mina, Bernard and André Gomes. Bernard was first to sign on deadline day after receiving a work permit to move to the Premier League following five seasons at Shakhtar Donetsk. The Brazil winger, a free agent having allowed his contract with Ukraine’s champions to expire at the end of last season, signed a four-year contract at Goodison Park. Bernard wanted £200,000 a week earlier in the summer but the 25-year-old ultimately lowered demands that had deterred interest from West Ham, Chelsea and Milan, among others.
In the race to acquire the most sophisticated security tools, many forget that the first line of defense is really the user. Protecting business desktops, laptops, tablets and other IT equipment from misuse starts at the end-user level. It's important that the business defines boundaries for appropriate use and communicates those boundaries clearly and concisely to all employees. Creating policies is the first step in setting those boundaries and enforcing them. In addition, the template includes spaces for indicating who employees should address questions to within the IT department and what the consequences are for non-compliance.
Food allergies are on the rise in the United States. It is estimated that as many as 8 percent of children suffer from at least one food allergy. A food allergy is when your body’s immune system responds to a certain food as harmful and has a reaction. These reactions can range from itchy skin, vomiting or diarrhea to trouble breathing, wheezing or anaphylaxis, which is life-threatening. Although it is uncertain why food allergies have increased, one theory is the hygiene hypothesis: Our immune system’s job is to fight germs and stave off infections.
Still no sign of the return to the Commons of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill and the Trade Bill - two vital Brexit measures that have completed committee stage consideration but are under threat of hostile amendment, when they come back before the whole House. Jeremy Corbyn's speech on Monday has cleared the way for Labour to back Conservative MP Anna Soubry's EU customs union amendment to the Trade Bill - new clause five - which means it could very well be passed. In the Commons as in the Lords, the government is only in danger of defeat if Labour pitches in with Tory rebels.
With barely a whimper of dissent, the Senate has taken a step that would make racism in the application of death sentences virtually unchallengeable. In defeating a bill to force states to justify racially biased patterns in death sentencing, the proposed Racial Justice Act (news article, May 25), the Senate has betrayed the constitutional rights of African-Americans to equal protection of the laws. The purported ''protection'' afforded by capital punishment is extended almost exclusively to white people. Prosecutors who claim -falsely - that the death penalty is a deterrent simply don't use it to fight crimes in black communities.
Lauri Markkanen earned his second Pac-12 Player of the Week award in voting conducted by media who cover the league. The 7-0 forward from Jyväskylä, Finland averaged a double-double of 22.5 points on 53 percent shooting (16-30) and 12.0 rebounds to lead now 4th ranked Arizona to a road sweep of the Washington schools.

Risks to the world economy remain to the downside and include sharply weaker global growth and a sudden change to expectations regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate path, Societe Generale warned on Tuesday. The French bank also said there was still a 30 percent chance of an economic "hard landing" for China, in its quarterly economic outlook. "The potential for policy errors in China is substantial, and all the more so since a new bubble appears to be building in the property market," Societe Generale analysts, led by Patrick Legland and Michala Marcussen, said in the report.

Earlier this month, millions of people throughout the Arab world viewed, for the first time, a televised debate between two presidential candidates: Egypt's secularist Amr Moussa, and Islamist Abdel-Moneim Abul-Futoh. The debate, which lasted four hours, was unique in itself. This is because for many decades the Arab masses were accustomed to hearing one leader and one candidate. Today, they feel democracy has indeed been attained. They also feel that their next president, whoever he may be, will not be a gift from a merciful providence, or a leader for whom the nation must sacrifice its blood and soul.
UPDATE, 2:25 PM: The final scores are in, at least for one of the big games last night, and you have to call it a home run for Fox. With an audience of 17.2 million watching the Kansas City Royals beat the New York Mets 7-2 in Game 5 of the 2015 World Series, the net saw the highest Game 5 viewership since 2003. That Game 5 between the New York Yankees and the Florida Marlins snagged a crowd of 19.9 million. Let’s add some more history to that and note that the victory brought the Royals their first World Series since 1985.
We were in Seattle, sitting around my son’s table after a sumptuous meal. “Kate, I have a question for you about languages,” declared Jesse, a Canadian and a sensitive law student (yes, they really do exist). “What kind of question?” I asked. “You mean like in ‘A Fish Called Wanda?’” I laughed. “Oh, you mean gender,” I replied. “Actually,” I went on, “I don’t think they think of it in terms of male and female.
A federal judge will hear arguments for and against stopping “Clean Truck” programs at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach just three weeks before the ports are scheduled to begin implementing the program. In July, the American Trucking Association filed a civil lawsuit to stop both ports from implementing their own versions of “Clean Truck” programs. On Aug. 7, Federal Judge Christina Snyder set a hearing for Sept. 8 in which the ATA will state its case and the city of Los Angeles and other defendants will argue their opposition.
Homeowners are increasingly looking to technology for home security solutions, to save on heating and cooling costs and even to help them cook the perfect steak. In fact, 46% of consumers recently surveyed by ERA Real Estate and HGTV said it was important for their current or next home to have smart home technology. And 51% of the 2,437 consumers polled said they’d consider installing smart home technology in their home to make it more appealing to future buyers.

San Jose, California has the most expensive housing market in the country. Rising home prices and high mortgage rates have challenged potential home buyers across the country, and for would-be buyers in seven cities, the bar has been set higher. A recent analysis by mortgage data provider HSH.com finds homeownership continues to be out of reach for all but the highest earners in these metropolitan areas. To arrive at its figures, HSH.com used the latest quarterly home-price information from the National Association of Realtors. It incorporated local property tax and homeowner's insurance costs to calculate the income needed to qualify for a median-priced home.
Stocks lost 1 percent on Wednesday, the U.S. market's biggest drop since late October. But Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said that the S&P 500 could reach 1,200 in the short-term and 1,300 to 1,350 in the longer-term. He shared his insight. “1,200 we think is the number we’re going to achieve, fully discounting fourth quarter earnings—meaning over the next month or two, as we report the fourth quarter,” Orlando told CNBC. Orlando said historically, gridlock has been favorable for the economy and the markets.

As Rehana Fathima tried to reach the Sabarimala shrine in Kerala on Friday, carrying on her head the offerings for Lord Ayyappa, like all devotees and guarded by hundreds of policemen, there was trouble for her back home in Kochi. Ms Fathima's home was vandalised by men angry with her for trying to "defy" Sabarimala's centuries-old ban on women of menstrual age, or between 10 and 50 years; the Supreme Court last month ended the ban in a landmark ruling. The police arrived at Ms Fathima's house after being alerted by neighbours.
Virginia ? Rep. John Murtha, the tall, gruff-mannered former Marine who became the de facto voice of veterans on Capitol Hill and later an outspoken and influential critic of the Iraq War, died Monday. He was 77. The Pennsylvania Democrat had been suffering complications from gallbladder surgery. He died at Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington, Va., spokesman Matthew Mazonkey said. In 1974 Murtha, then an officer in the Marine Reserves, became the first Vietnam War combat veteran elected to Congress. Ethical questions often shadowed his congressional service, but he was best known for being among Congress’ most hawkish Democrats.
JOINT BASE ELMENDORF-RICHARDSON, Alaska -- U.S. Army Alaska and the Indian Army celebrated the end of Yudh Abhyas 2010 during a ceremony Nov. 14 at Buckner Physical Fitness Center, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

A Jim Thorpe police officer who charged a borough man with escape testified yesterday that he never told the man he was under arrest or was being detained. Patrolman Stephen Shabazian admitted at a preliminary hearing that all he did Sept. 15 was ask Joseph Kennedy for his driver's license -- while Shabazian was sitting in his cruiser and Kennedy was walking by. District Justice Edward Lewis of Jim Thorpe tossed out the escape charge and a summary offense of failing to produce a driver's license when asked. Lewis convicted Kennedy of driving on the wrong side of the road and imposed a $25 fine.

The diffuse blue object near the center of this composite image is believed to be a cosmic "ghost," called HDF 130, generated by a huge eruption from a supermassive black hole in a distant galaxy. In thefirst detection of its kind, astronomers have found a cosmic "ghost"lurking around a distant supermassive black hole. Scientiststhink that the discovery, made with NASA's ChandraX-ray Observatory, is evidence of a huge eruption produced by the blackhole and could give astronomers a valuable opportunity to observe phenomenathat occurred when the universe was very young.
Average prices are up 29 percent from 2009. We finally know how much the 2020 Jeep Gladiator will cost. The truck starts at a shave north of $35,000, delivered. And if that seems ridiculous for a steel-wheeled pickup truck to you, you’re not alone. We see all sorts of new vehicles around here, and increasingly, the first question out of any of our mouths is not, "how much horsepower does it have?" but rather, "What was the sticker?" That’s where the really shocking numbers tend to lie.
Rolling Thunder: A Moving Tribute to MIAs Each Memorial Day, the bikers of "Rolling Thunder" ride their motorcycles into the nation's capital to call attention to soldiers still missing in action.

As bikers gathered in Arlington, Virginia before thundering off to the National Cemetery and memorials along the Mall, Producer Ned Wharton met a few of the riders.
We suppose it's Photoshop for the earth. Like magazine art directors make unsightly blemishes disappear from models, Google is making earth's obscuring cloud cover disappear. "Mining data from a large number of Landsat images of each area allowed us to reconstruct cloud-free imagery even in tropical regions that are always at least partly cloudy," wrote Matt Hancher, tech lead of the Google Earth Engine on the Google Maps blog. After mining "hundreds of terabytes of data" from the U.S. Geological Survey and NASA's Landsat 7 satellite, Google as able to create a map of the earth with 15 meters per pixel.
Face it, it's a question we've all asked from time to time: "Is there any way to make William Fichtner more of a badass?" In this exclusive look at the behind-the-scenes features of the "Drive Angry" DVD and Blu-ray (available now), we see how director Patrick Lussier wrestled with that idea, and how he and his team put together one of the over-the-top movie's most over-the-toppest moments. When you have Fichtner playing a character called "The Accountant" who is in the employ of Satan and a few million bucks to spend on pyrotechnics - your work is half done, really.
It could be time to say goodbye to a beloved rover. The rovers moved like migratory birds. Opportunity and Spirit arrived on Mars within days of each other, at different locations along the planet’s equator, in January 2004, equipped with instruments to study the rust-colored soil. During the Martian winter, engineers directed the rovers to north-facing slopes, so that their solar panels could soak up as much sunlight as possible each day. When one of Spirit’s wheels stopped working, it kept going by driving backwards, dragging the defunct wheel behind it.

Professor Panos Zavos: The world must "come to grips with cloning"
A private consortium of scientists plans to clone a human being within the next two years. The group says it will use the technique only for helping infertile couples with no other opportunity to become parents. It says the technology will resemble that used to clone animals, and will be made widely available. One member said the group hoped to produce the world's first baby clone within 12 to 24 months. It was founded by an Italian physician, Dr Severino Antinori, whose work includes trying to help post-menopausal women to become pregnant.
The voices of more than 1 million people all over the world were gathered to produce a United Nations report that reflects their priorities concerning development issues, which will help Member States shape the post-2015 sustainability agenda.

DAVID WAGNER’S arrival at Huddersfield was a prime example of a club thinking laterally to compete with parachute payment-funded rivals in the Championship. There was no way Town would be able to go toe-to-toe financially with sides trousering multi-millions following relegation from the Premier League. So they thought outside the box and brought in a left-field coach with a fresh set of ideas to change the whole ethos of the club — and it paid off magnificently. Other sides are similarly seeking out original and alternative ways to bridge the gap to the second tier’s super wealthy.

NEW YORK — Former congressman Anthony Weiner, whose penchant for sexting strangers online ended his political career and led to an investigation that upended the presidential race, will appear in federal court Friday to plead guilty to charges in connection with his online communications with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, officials said. A law enforcement official said Weiner has agreed to plead guilty to a charge of transferring obscene material to a minor.

The Maleficent star wrote and directed By the Sea, in which she co-starred with her husband, and during an interview on the Hollywood Reporter's Awards Chatter podcast this week, she concluded it "may not have been a good idea". She explained: "I wanted us to do some serious work together, and I wanted to see him do that kind of work.

Jones was the centerpiece for the quarterback-needy Gators. He’ll enroll early, which Mullen said will give him a chance to compete with incumbent Feleipe Franks for Florida’s starting job. Jones aside, Florida’s next-most important signee might have been its lowest rated. Evan McPherson, the nation’s top prep kicker, chose the Gators. McPherson had been committed to Mullen at MSU before following him to Florida. Former starter Eddy Pineiro announced Tuesday that he’s leaving UF early for the NFL Draft, so McPherson could compete for the starting job right away.
"Carrying coals to Newcastle" means wasting effort on something unnecessary. Newcastle, the historic capital of the Durham and Northumberland coal fields, had all the coal it needed. But the expression will have to be retired. Last month, the Port of Tyne, Newcastle's harbor, began receiving large-scale coal imports from Russia to fuel a nearby aluminum smelter. Twenty years after former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared war on the powerful mineworkers union, the coal industry in Britain is clinically dead. And Newcastle, once the industry's gritty hub, has been forced not only to import coal but also to reinvent itself.
A new study presents a simple way to deal with out-of-control raccoon populations: scare their appetite away with the sound of barking dogs. Raccoons on B.C. 's Gulf Islands have been living the good life for more than a century, ever since their natural predators were hunted off the islands by humans. The raccoons spend day and night on the shoreline, gorging on seafood, which has had a detrimental effect on the intertidal ecosystem. But in a study published Wednesday in Nature Communications, one ecologist presents a simple solution: scare the raccoons' appetite away with the sound of barking dogs.
By the time you hear the cute acronym, it may already be too late. On this edition of Motley Fool Answers, we go international, looking at the BRIC nations -- Brazil, Russian, India, and China -- which were viewed as having huge potential 10 or 15 years ago. In this segment, Joe Magyer, Chief Investment Officer at Lakehouse Capital and regular contributor to Fool Australia, talks to Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp about why you shouldn't get wrapped up in an investment premise that "everyone" agrees on. Alison Southwick: So that was the BRIC.

While fans might have been caught off guard to hear that Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani could be a bit more than "just friends," it seems Shelton's ex-wife, Miranda Lambert, is anything but surprised. A source tells E! News exclusively that the "Little Red Wagon" singer is taking the time since her split from the country crooner to focus on herself and her career. "Miranda is at a point in her life where she is really focusing on herself and her music. This is a new chapter for her to create new relationships and really move on," the insider says.
Who are the protectors of data? You probably howled with disapproval when you learned about the recent data mess at the Department of Foreign Affairs. Aside from that unacceptable inaccessibility or loss of data, nothing bad seems to have happened — yet. But you wonder, what could happen to your personal data? How could it be used to deceive others or commit other crimes? This not the first time that the government had a data loss incident. Remember the one that happened to the Commission on Elections? Millions of voter data were downloaded from its website, and it included passport numbers and even fingerprint scans.

Climate change and polars bears: it may kill them soon. Polar bears are historically some of zoos’ most popular charismatic megafauna. It’s not hard to see why! Polar bears may be even more threatened by climate change than scientists previously realized, according to a new study led by the U.S. Geological Survey. The bears rely on floating sea ice to mate, travel, and hunt. But thanks to climate change, this ice is melting quickly, forcing polar bears onto land, far away from their typical prey—namely, seals. Without seals to eat, many bears starve to death.
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with a well-organised racket, conducted by unscrupulous education agencies, whereby local students are left stranded in countries neighbouring the European Union (EU). The arrest came following the Foreign Ministry’s tip-off to the police, a senior official of the Ministry’s consular division told the Sunday Observer. “Some students seek help to return but others stay behind, doing odd jobs because their parents have borrowed money to send them overseas for study, while others have opted to stay behind because of embarrassment,” the official said.

Veterinarians Asked To Euthanize Animals Inappropriately Feel 'Moral Distress' : Shots - Health News Most of the 800 veterinarians surveyed feel ethical qualms when pet owners ask them to euthanize animals that could be treated, or when owners ask to keep pets alive who will suffer needlessly. The authors of a new study on veterinarians and mental health say vet school should include more training on how to cope with the moral distress vets face when asked by pet owners to do things that are against their medical judgment. In some ways, it can be harder to be a doctor of animals than a doctor of humans.
A researcher who claimed to have created the world's first genetically-edited babies will face a Chinese police investigation, state media said Monday, as authorities confirmed that a second woman fell pregnant during the experiment. World cycling's governing body, the UCI, is to ban painkiller tramadol from March 1 and will punish offenders with penalties ranging from a fine to a nine-month suspension. Vlastimil Gular's life took an unwelcome turn a year ago: minor surgery on his vocal cords revealed throat cancer, which led to the loss of his larynx and with it, his voice.
It's that time of year again. Not the holidays, but strep throat season. It's a common and painful infection for young kids that's usually cured by antibiotics. But for a few children, strep can trigger bizarre behavioral disorders such as severe tantrums, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and even tics. It's a rare complication caused by an immune system that attacks the strep bacteria and the child's brain. The Markowitz family says their son went from being happy-go-lucky to a totally different kid seemingly overnight. Saul and Bonnie say they remember the day their world changed forever in February 2007.

As mobile computers have become more common, criminals have begun to explore ways to profit from exploiting them. However, figures released Wednesday by mobile security company Lookout indicate that people are more likely to fall victim to what it calls “adware” than classic criminal malware. Lookout sampled 200,000 apps to conclude that 6.5% of all free apps in the store for Android devices meet the company’s definition of adware, broadly defined as any app that pushes ads on a user outside of its own interface without consent. Adware might use notifications or add icons to the device homescreen.
April has truly lived up to its reputation as the cruelest month of the year. After a long winter, spring is still out of reach. Expect more chilly temperatures, although Environment Canada is calling for things to get a little milder — 7C on Thursday — towards the latter part of the week. “The long-term average temperature for Pearson in April is 7.1C and the long-term average snowfall for April is 4.5 cm,” said Geoff Coulson, a meteorologist with Environment Canada. While this month’s average temperature will likely end up below normal, 2018 is not especially unusual in delivering us a chilly April.

East Timor President Jose Ramos-Horta casts his ballot during the presidential election in Dili, East Timor, Saturday, March 17, 2012. Preliminary election results in East Timor indicate the country is headed for a presidential run-off without incumbent leader Jose Ramos-Horta. With more than 60 percent of the vote tallied, Francisco Guterres, from the main opposition Fretilin party, is ahead with about 28 percent of the vote, followed by former military chief Jose Maria de Vasconcelos with 25 percent. President Ramos-Horta, a Nobel Peace laureate, is trailing in third place with a little more than 18 percent.
When Should A Scientist’s Faith Disqualify Him From Scientific Institutional Authority? I anticipated creationists figuring in your reply. The problem is, though, I’m not really sure they’re the best example of religion ‘polluting’ the scientific endeavor. Outside of other creationists and evangelical Christians, nobody takes ‘creation scientists’ seriously. If these people were peddling their faith-polluted science in peer-reviewed journals and whatnot I think you’d have a point, but since these people aren’t really part of any respected scientific circles I wonder if it’s appropriate to call them scientists in any meaningful sense.
There are thousands of getaways to explore this year. Here are some ideas to get you started. Produced by Matthew Bloch, Phaedra Brown, Alicia DeSantis, Alexandra Eaton, Niko Koppel, Dan Saltzstein, Maureen Towey, Jessica White and Josh Williams. The No. 2 entry on Page T2 about Atacama Desert, Chile, erroneously attributes a distinction to a telescope at a hotel there. It is one of the country’s largest privately owned telescopes, not its largest telescope. The No. 14 entry on Page T2 about Penzance, England, describes its location incorrectly.
Is it just me or does there seem to be some organized spin out over the weekend to call the election for President Obama now? Check out the Politico for the best of these, but everyone is out doing it. Here’s the thing — I have a theory that polling is taking longer to respond to events because of the overwhelming flow of information these days. I think, objectively, Mitt Romney did himself a disservice by being too vague and failing to close the deal in his speech and Bill Clinton helped Barack Obama.
IBM researchers have developed a new class of solar-powered electricity-generating cells that they claim will bring photovoltaic cells closer to cost parity with conventional energy sources. The researchers from IBM's T. J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York have published their findings in a paper entitled "High-Efficiency Solar Cell with Earth-Abundant Liquid-Processed Absorber," available here (PDF). The materials used in the new cell are copper, zinc, tin, selenium, and sulfur - the latter two "earth-abundant" materials being in a chalcogenide compound, key to the photovoltaic properties of the cell.
The exchange rate of the Costa Rican colón against the dollar increased by ₡6 during the first four months of this year, according to official data from the Central Bank of Costa Rica. Herrera attributes the fluctuations to seasonal factors during this period, particularly an increase in transactions from businesses that exchange dollar investments into colones to pay taxes, he said. On Jan. 1 the Central Bank set a sale price of ₡561, while the official price on Wednesday was of ₡567 for a dollar, a figure that continued to rise slightly since March 31.
There’s only one more weekend left for you to shop Unbranded, an innovative downtown Dallas pop-up shop that opened December 1 at 1517 Main St. There’s a rotating assortment (it changes weekly) of local brands offering everything from clothing and accessories to home decor. Long Lost Ceramics: handmade ceramics. Lounge County: men’s lounge pants. Viv Jordan: hand-lettered prints and cards. Krista Miller Art: acrylic paintings. Dallas entrepreneurs Matt Alexander (now of Rye 51 parent Q Fifty One Digital) and Bryan DeLuca (Foot Cardigan) founded Unbranded in 2014 as a way to support shopping local.
Households could face further energy increases after regulator Ofgem warned Britain is heading towards a supply squeeze. Alistair Buchanan, the watchdog’s outgoing chief executive, said the UK was facing pressure on gas reserves over the next three years as ageing power plants close and the country is forced to ‘go shopping around the world’ for the fossil fuel. Coal and oil-fired power stations are set to close earlier than expected to meet environmental targets and around 10 per cent of current generation stock will go by April – within three years, it will fall from around 15 per cent margin to below 5 per cent.

In other categories, coverage of mass shootings in the United States and investigations into US President Donald Trump featured prominently. The New York Times and the Washington Post also took two Pulitzers each. "I'm thrilled that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo and their colleagues have been recognized for their extraordinary, courageous coverage, and our photojournalists for their moving pictures that show humanity defying huge obstacles," Adler said. "I remain deeply distressed, however, that our brave reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are still behind bars."

Once upon a time... Yeah, yeah! Has Andres Izarra only just woken up from a state of Rip Van Winkle comatose? VHeadline editor & publisher Roy S. Carson writes: Once upon a time... Yeah, yeah! I know it sounds like a fairy tale, but once upon a time there was a dashing young 'prince' who had idealism, journalistic integrity and the 'cajones' to tell multi-millionaire RCTV mogul Marcel Granier to stuff it!

New Raza Left:	Education is a Right! | Fight Back! Los Angeles, CA - The New Raza Left Los Angeles, after summing up our last campaign against Proposition 21 has decided to now focus our organizing efforts on educational justice to improve the bad conditions in our schools. In the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) conditions have reached crisis levels. Overcrowded and old inner city schools, lack of resources and support for teachers, high push-out rates, and forced racist standardized testing. Combine this with the destruction of bilingual education and the push by profit driven business interests to take over the LAUSD.

Rafael Montero isn't so young anymore. The one-time up-and-coming prospect made his major league debut three years ago against the Yankees and Montero has struggled to live up to the Mets' expectations since then. Still, with a glut of injuries to the starting rotation, the Mets have given him every opportunity to prove himself. As the Mets use the next few months to evaluate their future, Montero has to make a case for yet another chance next season. Monday, they got a little glimpse of what they have been looking for.
CAIRO (Reuters) - Thousands of angry Egyptians defied a curfew on Saturday for the second day in a row and stayed on the streets to push their demand that President Hosni Mubarak resign. The army had warned that anyone who remained on the streets after 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) would be in danger, but as the deadline passed, protests continued in central Cairo and the port city of Alexandria, witnesses said. Soldiers took no immediate action. They seemed relaxed and some protesters chatted with troops mounted on armoured vehicles, the witnesses said.
The casket is carried from the hearse to the gravesite by Jewish men, usually by the Chevra Kaddisha, with the decedent's feet facing the front. It is customary that direct descendants of the deceased do not touch or carry the casket. During the procession, Psalm 91 is recited seven times. Beginning from a short distance from the grave (approximately thirty feet), it is customary to halt the procession every few feet and repeat the Psalm, pausing at certain words in the final verse and reciting again from the top.

Civil service workers at a west London tax office struck on Wednesday in a fight to save jobs. The defence has concluded its summing up in the trial of David Duckenfield and Graham Mackrell. The Tories’ Brexit crisis has descended further into farce. But behind the absurdity is a deep panic in the ruling class. A primary school in Birmingham has dropped a programme that includes LGBT+ education after weeks of parent protests. Thousands of workers have been plunged into an uncertain future as outsourcing giant Interserve collapsed into ­administration last week. Socialist Worker is backing UCU Left member Jo McNeill for general secretary of the UCU union.
This week Wal-Mart announced a gift of half a million dollars to help protect 28,000 acres of forest in Idaho and Washington, as part of the company’s ongoing Acres for America program, run in partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The first thing to be said about this move — and, more broadly, Wal-Mart’s involvement in Acres for America — is, of course, that it’s good for the forests, and shows that by relentlessly criticizing a company, activists can force it to do some decent things.
Topic “Attorney General Eric Holder” | Fight Back! In the face of ineffective, and even harmful, government measures to assist distressed homeowners, an effort has been launched by the People’s Organization for Progress (POP) and the Coalition to Save Our Homes (C2SOH) to demand criminal investigations of bank wrongdoing during the mortgage bubble. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder got a cold reception in Minneapolis May 27, where the Committee to Stop FBI Repression dogged him all day about FBI and grand jury attacks on anti-war and international solidarity activists.
MESA, Ariz. (AP) The Chicago Cubs have released veteran reliever Justin Grimm. The 29-year-old right-hander was a part of teams that made three straight NL Championship Series appearances and won the World Series in 2016. But he struggled last season with a 1-2 record and 5.53 ERA in 50 appearances. Grimm had a 3.82 ERA in 4 1/2 years with the Cubs. Chicago acquired him and Carl Edwards Jr. from Texas in a deal that sent Matt Garza to the Rangers in July 2013. Grimm's best season was in 2015, when he had a 1.99 ERA in 62 appearances.
Sometimes an iDevice is best used for idle, pointless fun. Today's segment of Making Art on Your iOS Device is a mixed bag of time-wasting cool effects and random, but useful art-making tools. Below, 10 apps for creating anything from erratic hand-shaken digital effects to your very own DIY Andy Warhol prints. You will need one iDevice plus a camera, or two iDevices. The image to the right (though not as impressive as some of the app's other sample images) was created "using an iPhone as a camera while someone waved an iPod touch with the App 'Light Painting' installed."
DES MOINES, Iowa – Animal control officers in Des Moines used a tranquilizer to capture a mysterious goat that had dived into traffic and was on the run for hours. The Boer goat got a taste of freedom Wednesday morning as she evaded capture on the city&apos;s south side. The brown and white animal with floppy ears ran into traffic and eventually went into a fenced car dealership. The Des Moines Register reports (http://dmreg.co/HfuQA4 ) officers chased the goat around the dealership before using a tranquilizer to stop her. Officials say the goat appears to be healthy and uninjured.
BASTROP, Texas – When the Texas Air National Guard first joined the Texas Military Forces Best Warrior Competition in 2013, then-Air Force Staff Sgt. Matthew Renteria proclaimed that he would "win it all." Though he did not end up winning it all in 2013, he finished a close second in the competition’s noncommissioned officer division. Now a technical sergeant, he returned to compete in the 2015 Best Warrior Competition at Camp Swift, this time bringing a lifelong friend who helped him forge his competitive spirit: Air Force Senior Airman Michael Renteria.
MARIANA, Brazil (AFP) - A dam burst on Thursday (Nov 6) at a mining waste site in Brazil, killing at least 17 people and injuring more than 50, a fire chief said. "The number of missing is going to surpass 40 but that is not official," said Adao Severino Junior, fire chief in the city of Mariana in south-eastern Minas Gerais state. The village of Bento Rodrigues near the dam is practically buried in mud, the fire chief said. "The situation is grim. It is dark. There is a lot of mud," Severino said.
BOSTON - Vladimir Sobotka did his best work in the third period after a frustrating middle frame. The Bruins centre, denied a goal in the second period when the puck entered the net after the final horn, set up Blake Wheeler 2:47 into the third and then finished off a 2-on-1 feed from Wheeler 4:15 later to give Boston a 2-0 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday. Rookie Tuukka Rask turned aside 19 shots for his second shutout in eight NHL starts, but the game was scoreless until Sobotka and Wheeler struck with help from linemate Daniel Paille.
Thanks to Facebook and other social media channels, the Nestle Company has an enormous public relations mess on their hands. The question is, can they further use social media to fix the problem? Other downtrodden companies such as Toyota and various airlines are embracing social media channels in hopes of repairing their current poor image. Unfortunately, Nestle’s social media embrace is being more than spurned by consumers; it’s also drawing large quantities of vitriolic comments, viral video parodies, animated parodies of the company’s reaction to the reaction, and so on.
NEW YORK (AP) — The late rapper Tupac Shakur and Seattle-based rockers Pearl Jam lead a class of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees including folkie Joan Baez and 1970s favorites Journey, Yes and Electric Light Orchestra. The rock hall, in downtown Cleveland, also said Tuesday it would give a special award to Nile Rodgers, whose disco-era band Chic failed again to make the cut after its 11th time nominated. Baez will be inducted only months after her 1960s paramour, Bob Dylan, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. The hall's 32nd annual induction ceremony will take place on April 7 at the Barclays Center.
SPICER: You already got your question, John. We’re doing one-question Friday. Q: But this is an important point. MR. SPICER: No, it’s not, John. Pool reporters will only be allowed to ask questions in the form of charades, and must exclusively use their hands and bodies to express themselves. The press secretary will have forty-five seconds to guess what the reporter is miming. If the press secretary correctly guesses the entire question, he will answer it. If the reporter makes any noise, he or she is disqualified.
Jeff Flake just became a political giant, and now he’s coming to N.H.
Sen. Jeff Flake caused political waves Friday when he helped pave the way for an FBI investigation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Now the Arizona Republican is scheduled to ride that newfound name recognition into New Hampshire during a visit that is sparking further speculation that President Trump could very well face a primary challenge as he runs for re-election in 2020. It will be the second visit by the outspoken critic of Trump to the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House.
Bergerac on 11th Street at Folsom in S.F. The ostensible inspiration for Bergerac, the SoMa cocktail bar opened in 2013, is Villa Nellcôte, the Côte d’Azur mansion in whose basement the Rolling Stones recorded “Exile on Main Street” in 1972. The villa, which was Keith Richards’ residence for a year, was ornately appointed. Private chefs prepared luxurious food, servants waited on guests and legendary parties went down. Gastronomic temple, den of mayhem and site of genius artistic creation — what better concept for a bar? Nellcôte’s imprint on Bergerac, however, is subtle.
Investors in Canadian retailer Indigo Books & Music Inc. are hoping for another hot-selling holiday season – on the heels of last year’s record performance – to help revive the stock now trading at three-year lows. Shares of Canada’s largest book retailer have fallen about 30 per cent over the past year amid intensifying competition from giant retailers such as Amazon as well as digital books and magazines. Also weighing on the stock is the cost of an ambitious store renovation program that has eaten into profits, causing the company to miss expectations in its second quarter ended Sept. 29.
Oh, how far we've come from Earth Days past — when the phrase “green home” conjured images of straw-bale structures, when solar panels seemed like such an earnest novelty, when “LEED certified” hadn't yet crept into public consciousness. With Earth Day 2012 almost upon us, nearly 60,000 homes in the United States are in the process of being certified in the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Education and Environmental Design program, according to Nate Kredich, the organization's vice president of residential market development. Need more convincing proof of just how far we've come?

A federal judge on Friday blocked a new Missouri law that requires health insurers to offer plans that exclude contraception coverage if employers or individuals object to birth control on moral or religious grounds. U.S. District Judge Audrey Fleissig granted a temporary restraining order preventing the enforcement of the law, writing that it appears to conflict with the new federal health care law. Republican lawmakers in Missouri drafted the law in response to President Barack Obama's policy of requiring insurers to cover birth control for free as part of the new federal health care law, even if they work for a church or other employer that has a moral objection.
Last week, Amazon released a new kind of Dash button we’ve all been waiting for: one you can program to merge just about any internet-connected devices together. It all sounds great in theory and seemingly affordable for $20 – until you realize that the battery is not rechargeable or replaceable, and only lasts 1,000 pushes. That’s two cents a push, and no, there’s no counter to tell you how many clicks are left. Amazon suggests that some things you can do with the button is pizza ordering or Airbnb check in and outs.
MELBOURNE, Australia — If anyone knows how Novak Djokovic feels after sweating and scrapping for almost five hours in the Australian Open semifinals, it’s his next opponent — Rafael Nadal. A day after Nadal beat Roger Federer in four compelling sets, Djokovic dug deep to overcome Andy Murray 6-3, 3-6, 6-7 (4), 6-1, 7-5 on Friday night after 4 hours, 50 minutes. Defending champion Djokovic will face Nadal in a third straight Grand Slam final on Sunday. It’s a reversal from three years ago, when Nadal had to regroup after his own lengthy semifinal.
In a freezing wilderness of breathtaking beauty, Rob Fenwick encounters a dangerous predator. We are nearly at 80 degrees north, well inside the Arctic Circle, when we spot a polar bear. We edge the yacht closer to the solitary granite rock where, under the soft glow of the midnight sun and framed by purple peaks, wide blue glaciers and a cold black sea, we gaze at this fearless creature tearing at a seal. Occasionally it turns its great head and gives us an icy stare. No amount of National Geographic Channel will prepare you for your first encounter with a polar bear in the wild.
China is looking at joining the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement. China's Political Counsellor in Wellington, Cheng Lei, this weekend told TV3's "The Nation" that his country was "actively studying the relevant clauses of the TPP and actively studying and I don't want to exclude the possibility of China's entry into this kind of arrangement in the future. " The TPP is a nine nation trade agreement currently being negotiated including New Zealand, the United States, Australia and Chile with Japan, South Korea and Taiwan among a list of nations proposing to join.
It's one of the most popular parties following the Academy Awards: The Vanity Fair Oscar party. Stars flocked to the celebration after the 91st Oscars on Sunday. A tradition for every who's who in Hollywood, there's no VIP section at the party, and it's not the easiest invitation to get, but once you're in, you're in the same room as everyone else, according to Vanity Fair. "Celebrity handlers, bodyguards, and even agents are virtually nonexistent," the magazine said. Now in its 25th year, the party in Beverly Hills continues to attract celebrities following the awards show.
Two suspects in a weekend stabbing near the Boise airport made their initial court appearances in Ada County Monday. Police say Jacob Gibson and Kyle Meyer are responsible for a stabbing in a hotel room near the Boise airport around 4:15 a.m. Saturday morning. 21-year-old Jacob Gibson is charged with a felony for accessory to aggravated battery and two felony probation violations. 21-year-old Kyle Meyer is charged with felony aggravated battery and a felony probation violation.

Real Madrid are expected to confirm a world record £56 million deal to bring Kaka to the Bernabeu, a move that signals a return to the 'Galactico' strategy under new president Florentino Perez. Kaka helped Brazil to a comfortable 4-0 World Cup qualifying win in Uruguay on Saturday and, despite previously having signalled a wish to remain at AC Milan, admitted that clarification on his future is imminent. Perez met last week with Bosco Leite, Kaka's father and agent, as well as AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani, who prepared the ground for his sale by contrasting the financial position of Italian clubs to that of Madrid or Barcelona.
Essentially, there are three different types of outpatient surgery centers: ambulatory surgery centers (ASC), physician office surgery centers and hospital outpatient department surgery centers. A recent news series by Kaiser Health News and the USA TODAY Network questioned patient safety and outcomes of procedures performed at outpatient surgery centers versus inpatient surgery centers. We applaud them for their compelling journalism and want to take this opportunity to provide additional insight on how to choose where to have outpatient surgery. Essentially, there are three different types of outpatient surgery centers: ambulatory surgery centers (ASC), physician office surgery centers and hospital outpatient department surgery centers.

The Canadan Mortgage and Housing Corporation announced that the annual rate of housing starts in October came in at 167,900 units, down from the previous September rate of 185,000.

Wesley Witherspoon, G/F, Memphis, Soph. In the words of LL Cool J, what I have on Witherspoon’s game is “more than a crush.” The Tiger sophomore reminds me of Evan Turner in that he is extremely versatile and can play four positions at the college level including the point. After a fairly quiet year, Witherspoon has exploded for 55 points in his last two games. At 6-8, he is a difficult match-up on the wing in that he can take defenders off the dribble or knock down the triple.
As a Buddhist, Tan Cheow Hong didn't expect to run up against Malaysia's Islamic laws. Then last November, his estranged wife showed up at their child's school with a court order from a Sharia judge, who had granted her temporary custody of their 7-year-old. The wife took their daughter away with the help of Islamic officials and police. "If I had tried to stop them they would have arrested me," says Mr Tan. He says he had no idea his wife had become a Muslim. The next day his wife converted their daughter to Islam without Mr Tan's consent.
Life is sweet for Mike Rich, a lanky 41-year-old Oregonian whose first screenplay has just been made into a major movie with a major star: ''Finding Forrester,'' an inspirational drama that casts Sean Connery as a reclusive writer who befriends a South Bronx teenager. The inspiration for ''Finding Forrester,'' which opened to mixed reviews but good business last week, came to Mr. Rich at work. ''We were interviewing an author, and we started talking about how so many of them -- Salinger, Shaw, Fitzgerald -- were really an odd bunch.
Today Google reported its second quarter earnings, with revenues during the period of $8.36 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $10.12. Analysts had anticipated earnings per share of $10.04, and revenues, once traffic acquisition costs were deducted, of $8.41 billion. Google’s share price has declined since its last earnings report. Its massive purchase of Motorola will likely be detailed in its earnings call that will follow this release. We’ve learned today that Google’s CEO, Larry Page, will not be participating on the call.
Click HERE for War on Terrorism page. Click HERE for Intelligence page. LEWIS D. SCHILIRO, Assistant Director in Charge of the New York FBI Office and MARY JO WHITE, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that USAMA BIN LADEN and MUHAMMAD ATEF, a/k/a "Abu Hats," were indicted today in Manhattan federal court for the August 7, 1998, bombings of the United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and for conspiring to kill American nationals outside of the United States.
Bill Shorten has reportedly rejected an invitation from Rupert Murdoch to meet the media tycoon, promising to deal with News Corp through its Australian management. The comments to ABC’s 7:30 on the Labor leader’s tour of Queensland last week signals that Shorten will break with a tradition of Australian political leaders courting Murdoch’s favour, as former Labor leader Kevin Rudd did before his 2007 election victory. After a standing invitation from Murdoch to meet in New York, Shorten reportedly politely told the Australian-born media proprietor that it would not be necessary.
SAINTS men Jan Bednarek, Dusan Tadic and Cedric Soares will make their World Cup finals debuts in Russia. For Bednarek and Tadic, with Poland and Serbia respectively, this is their first chance to play at any major international competition finals. For right-back Cedric, though, Russia comes off the back of winning the Euros in 2016 with Portugal. Maya Yoshida completes the Saints quartet at the World Cup. The centre-back is going to his second tournament, having been part of the Japan team at Brazil in 2014, where the Blue Samurai finished bottom of their group without a win.
Top lawyers from Facebook, Twitter, and Google confirmed that they still don’t know how much influence Russian government-backed agents wield on their platforms during a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday morning. “Candidly, your companies know more about Americans in many ways than the United States government does, and the idea that you had no idea that any of this was happening strains my credibility,” Warner said. Warner grew frustrated with Stretch, in particular, when he wasn’t able to definitively answer whether Facebook had cross-checked 30,000 accounts suspended for suspicious activity in France with U.S. election interference.
The winner of last week's $337 million Powerball drawing has come forward and contacted Michigan Lottery officials. The winner's name and where they are from has not been released. The ticket was sold at a gas station in Lapeer, Mich., a city with a population of about 8,000 people, 60 miles north of Detroit. If the winner is a Lapeer resident, the city would receive some $2 million in tax revenue. The winning numbers from the Aug. 15 drawing were 6, 27, 46, 51, 56 and Powerball 21.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Four in 10 Americans say they have "a great deal" or "a fair amount" of trust and confidence in the mass media to report the news fully, accurately and fairly. This ties the historical lows on this measure set in 2014 and 2012. Prior to 2004, slight majorities of Americans said they trusted the mass media, such as newspapers, TV and radio. Americans' confidence in the media has slowly eroded from a high of 55% in 1998 and 1999. Since 2007, the majority of Americans have had little or no trust in the mass media.
Jamia Millia Islamia, a New Delhi-based Islamic university, is holding a special convocation on Friday to confer an honorary Doctor of Letters degree (Honoris Causa) to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The UN chief will arrive in India on Thursday for a four-day official visit.

The Victoria and Albert Museum will be closing curtains on its Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty exhibit, which had come to London after its previous run at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a final celebration, photographer Nick Knight and his team created a beautifully haunting film compiled of previously unseen footage of McQueen’s most famous designs. The mesmerizing video, via Dazed, includes footage from 2010, before the designer committed suicide in February of that year. Knight had met McQueen in the mid-nineties and the two became close collaborators.
Fresh parsley provides a fresh, crisp flavor to cooked and raw foods. Parsley, like most herbs, can grow well as a container plant. You can use small paper cups to start parsley seeds indoors for later transplanting, or you can use a larger plastic cup to grow the plant to maturity. Parsley requires a container approximately 6 inches deep to send out sufficient roots once it reaches its full size. The herb grows well indoors in a sunny window sill or as a fall or early spring plant in mild climates. Poke two or three drainage holes in the bottom of the cup with a nail.
Goalkeeper Tim Krul admired Norwich City’s Swansea journey, as they took a difficult first half and turned it into their 21st victory of a startling Championship campaign. The Swans posed more than a few questions of Daniel Farke’s second-tier leaders at Carrow Road on Friday night, in a compelling first half. But it was Emi Buendia’s stunning strike on 54 minutes that settled the contest, along with a more controlled offering from the hosts after the interval. “For sure it was three points to be proud of,” smiled Krul.
Micah Shrewsberry said Tatum is "an ultra-competitive guy." That’s what Celtics assistant coach Micah Shrewsberry tells rookie Jayson Tatum. Tatum, whose first season in the NBA has been downright impressive, is averaging 18.1 points per game this postseason. He’s tallied 253 total points through 14 playoff games, which slots him fourth on the all-time playoff scoring list for players 20 years old or younger. Only Kobe Bryant (328), Tony Parker (325), and Magic Johnson (293) logged more postseason points when they were Tatum’s age.
A woman who was battered over the head with a large piece of wood by sheep rustlers was airlifted to hospital with serious head injuries. Police and ambulance were called at 1.25pm yesterday to a report of a savage attack on a woman in her 40s who had tried to stop two men from stealing her sheep at Picton, near Crathorne. Described as suffering from “serious” and “severe” injuries to her head, the ambulance crew requested the Great North Air Ambulance Service (GNAAS) helicopter take the victim to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.
The Western media has provided scanty coverage of the DPRK position, upholding the absurd proposition that North Korea rather than the USA is a threat to Global Security. But, the U.S. side [Pompeo] came up only with its unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearization just calling for CVID, declaration and verification, all of which run counter to the spirit of the Singapore summit meeting and talks. The U.S. side never mentioned the issue of establishing a peace regime on the Korean peninsula which is essential for defusing tension and preventing a war.
China has the potential to become a superpower rivaling the U.S. It already is playing a critical political role in Asia, and its economic power is global. While the number of Christians in China has increased significantly during the past few decades, the church’s social influence remains minimal. Attention from outside often focuses on the suffering and persecution faced by the country’s believers. Myrrl Byler is director of the China Educational Exchange program, which sponsors various exchange and assistance programs with Chinese partners in educational institutions, local government organizations and Protestant churches.
Which bank branches is TSB going to close? More high street bank branches are set to close after TSB said it would shut a further 29 sites this year as its customers move online. The challenger bank, which was spun out of Lloyds Banking Group and is now owned by Spanish lender Sabadell, said that no jobs would be lost as a result of the closures, as staff will be offered alternative roles at other sites and many employees already work in more than one TSB branch. However, it takes the total number of TSB sites that will close this year to 38, leaving TSB with 550 branches.
Authorities in Texas said Friday they have a "person of interest" in the disappearance of a 22-year-old college student last seen more than a week ago. Investigators said the woman&apos;s boyfriend -- whom they did not name -- is "not cooperating" in the search for Zuzu Renee Verk, a student at Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Texas, about 100 miles from the Mexican border. The Texas Rangers and FBI are assisting in the search for Verk -- which has expanded outside of the Alpine area -- and a $50,000 reward is being offered for her safe return.
Opposition allege that poll is being rigged in favour of president and ruling party. "I cannot sleep with my conscience if I have rigged," Mugabe said as he cast his vote in the capital Harare. Mugabe is facing his toughest test as president since coming to power in 1980, as the country struggles under an economic crisis. Do you think Zimbabwe's elections will be fair? Zimbabwe has the highest rate of inflation in the world - over 100,000 per cent - and 80 per cent of the workforce is unemployed. Police said that the country was mostly calm during voting.
Carlos Lupi is the latest minister to come under the media spotlight over alleged wrongdoing, worsening a political headache for Rousseff that has distracted the government's attention from pushing economic reform bills through Congress. Weekly magazine Veja, citing unidentified lawmakers and officials, reported on Saturday that advisers to Lupi had demanded kickbacks on government contracts with nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs. Lupi has denied having any involvement in the misuse of public funds at his ministry. Unlike some other officials caught up in the anti-corruption sentiment sweeping Brazil, he has not been directly linked to any wrongdoing.

(1) Give a few meaningful gifts to our own children–and let them in on the plan. Some parents give an educational toy/game, something their child needs, and then a stocking of small gifts and treats. Other parents give three gifts for each child–to mirror the three gifts given to the Christ child. Some do a Frankincense (spiritual) gift, a Gold (want) gift, and a Myrrh (useful) gift–in addition to a stocking and a Christmas Eve gift (which is traditionally new pajamas in many families).
Workers boarded up the Wrightsville Beach Art Co. while preparing for the arrival of Hurricane Florence in Wrightsville Beach, N.C.
WILMINGTON, N.C. — Coastal residents fleeing a potentially devastating blow from Hurricane Florence encountered empty gasoline pumps and depleted store shelves as the monster storm neared the Carolina coast with 140-mile-per-hour winds and drenching rain that could last for days. A steady stream of vehicles full of people and belongings flowed inland Tuesday, and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper tried to convince everyone to flee. ‘‘The waves and the wind this storm may bring is nothing like you've ever seen.
STREAKS, STATS AND NOTES – Vikings have won five straight games at home vs. 49ers since losing 20-17 on Dec. 13, 1992. … Kyle Shanahan, starting second season as 49ers head coach, was offensive coordinator for current Vikings QB Kirk Cousins’ first two years in NFL with Washington. … 49ers closed 2017 with five straight wins, coinciding with QB Jimmy Garoppolo’s takeover as starter. … Garoppolo, including two victories for New England, has won all seven career NFL starts. He’s one of five QBs since 1970 AFL-NFL merger with streak that long.
GYPSUM – No one in Eagle Valley black or Arvada red wanted to see it happen this way. Midway through the first quarter, Arvada quarterback Jonathon Martinez called his own number on a draw. He was met by several Devils defenders in a seemingly-innocuous pileup. The Arvada senior lay motionless on the ground and was taken off in a stretcher in front of a very quiet crowd at Hot Stuff Stadium. The Devils held a 7-6 lead at the time, and the game, unfortunately, turned on that moment. Arvada went to its back-up quarterbacks.
HiCaliber Horse Rescue is gone. The controversial operation that earned the wrath of horse lovers, animal rights activists and rival rescues last year amid allegations of fundraising fraud, improper euthanasia of old and crippled horses, and mistreatment of animals ceased operation last month. Michelle Cochran, the brash leader of the rescue, and her supporters were evicted from the property they leased in rural Valley Center and are being sued by the owner, who is seeking $4 million in damages. The HiCaliber signs are gone from the 15-acre ranch, replaced only by the name of property owner, Brenda Markstein, on a lone mailbox.
A Chicago judge on Thursday dismissed a patent case between Apple and Motorola because, he said, neither side could adequately "establish a right to relief." As a result, a trial that was set to begin on Monday has been canceled. However, U.S. District Judge Richard Posner said he would "delay entry of judgment until I have prepared a full opinion, because in the course of that preparation, I may change my mind." In his brief filing yesterday, however, Posner said Apple has already admitted that it cannot prove damages on two of the four patents it is using against Motorola.
Newcastle United’s latest young hotshot was left with mixed emotions after making his first team debut. North Shields-born Callum Roberts came off the bench in Saturday’s FA Cup Third Round defeat to Leicester City. The fleet-footed winger was given 11 minutes in the 1-0 loss, replacing Haris Vuckic. The 17-year-old Academy graduate has been in a number of recent first team squads, reward for eye-catching performances at the under-21 level this term. Roberts – who attended Churchill Community College and played for Whitley Bay Sproggs before joining United at the age of eight – admitted he was left with mixed emotions.
Lawmakers ousted Rep. Don Shooter after harassment allegations, and that's a big step for Arizona women. Editorial: Lawmakers ousted Rep. Don Shooter after harassment allegations and that's a big step for Arizona women. Members of the Arizona House showed an impressive respect for the institution they represent by voting to expel Don Shooter. We can all be proud. It is particularly impressive because a solidly Republican body took action to expel a Republican colleague. That’s not easy. Lawmakers rose above politics. They came together to act on behalf of the honor of the House at time when partisanship often makes working together look impossible.
Rebecca Payne, a 22-year-old athletic training major and campus leader, was a 2004 New Milford High graduate and yearbook editor. On hearing the news, NMHS social studies teacher Brock Putnam described her as "a shaft of sunlight penetrating the gloom of the darkest day." "She was a wonderful, bright, vivacious girl -- an outstanding student," said John Lee, high school vice principal. "This is a real tragedy. Everyone who has heard has been really saddened by the news." Her parents, Nicholas and Virginia Payne, released a public statement through the Boston police late Wednesday afternoon.
WHO are Meghan Markle's bridesmaids? Prince Harry's bride announces choices through Kensington Palace. Meghan Markle's bridesmaids have been announced by Kensington Palace, as the royal wedding of the former Suits actress and Prince Harry draws closer. Kate Middleton's future sister-in-law, 36, has recently been left disappointed as her dad, Thomas Markle, revealed he can not travel to England and walk his daughter down the aisle due to his health. However, Meghan has continued with wedding plans for May 19, and even taken after the Duchess of Cambridge with some of her bridesmaid choices.
Springfield angler Larry Rottmann wasn't the only one having good luck at Stockton Lake last week. Rottmann said he was fishing for bass just after dawn when he noticed a commotion in the water near his boat. "I first thought it was carp, but it was too violent for that," Rottmann recalled. "So I eased over in my boat to see what it was." It wasn't a carp. It was a large Northern water snake that had a flathead catfish by the tail. "There was quite a tug of war," Rottmann said.
The Danilo is not a name that younger readers would know. Perhaps the Cannon MGM is more familiar, because that was the name it had at the closing of the cinema in 1993. Today the disused building at the corner of Trinity Lane and Hollycroft Hill was most recently a bar with widescreen television showing sporting events. The Danilo was Hinckley’s third purpose built cinema. The Hinckley Times of the March 13 1936 told its readers that an old hosiery factory was being demolished at the corner of Trinity Lane and Hollycroft to make way for a new cinema.
Online photos show Scott Brown before and after his weight-loss program. It was not the sight of their former senator bare-chested that shocked Scott Brown’s Facebook followers. They were used to that. It was the sales pitch accompanying the before-and-after photos of his physique, crediting his recent, dramatic weight loss to a commercial nutrition and fitness plan. Brown’s testament to the merits of AdvoCare’s “24-day challenge” was met with so many guffaws that within two hours, he posted another note, saying he is not a paid spokesman for the supplement company.
The Slovak health-care sector outperforms Hungary and Poland, but lags behind the Czech Republic. Slovakia is still failing to reduce the number of people dying of cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, patients need to wait up to three hours when going to the doctors’. As a result, Slovakia placed 23rd of 35 European countries surveyed by the Health Consumer Powerhouse organisation last year. Its position is better by one place than the year before, the Sme daily reported. Despite some improvement, the Slovak health sector still lags behind the Czech Republic which placed 13th. It is the highest position of the Visegrad Group countries.
The Title IX investigator assigned to the 2012 incident has reservations about her work on that case, Staben said. There also are “unresolved” questions about how the university was notified of the incident by Moscow Police, he said. Athletic Director Rob Spear has said he was unaware of the 2012 case until this year. Level, a regular starter, was not in the starting lineup in the next Vandals game. “The university was eventually informed, that’s clear, and athletics was eventually informed,” Staben said.
Pittsburgh scored 31 first half points, and ultimately gave the Panthers a 52-21 whipping in front Fox Sports’ Troy Aikman, Joe Buck and the whole world. The Steelers scored the most points ever at Heinz Field and tied the most points ever allowed by the Panthers. Roethlisberger completed 22-of-25 passes for 328 yards and five touchdowns. And all of a sudden Carolina (6-3) is really looking up at New Orleans (7-1) in the NFC South division race and has a little over a week to figure out what went wrong. And this is how bad it was.
Overseas buyers appear to be losing their enthusiasm for Australia, with ABC News revealing a multibillion-dollar drop in foreign investment in homes in the country. The news site covered a report from the country’s Foreign Investment Review Board, which showed foreign real estate approvals totalled A$25.2bn ($19.2bn) in 2016-17, compared with A$72.4bn in the previous financial year. In Cyprus, meanwhile, the country’s golden visa scheme — which grants full citizenship to those purchasing a home worth at least €2m on the island — has helped encourage an influx of foreign investment and new development, reported the Financial Times.
The public is invited to hear the first commercially recorded cylinders sold to the public. APPLETON - An event Tuesday at The History Museum at the Castle will highlight an exhibit at the Hearthstone Historic House Museum that honors the first commercially recorded cylinders that were ever sold to the public under the Edison name. It was not the phonograph, but the Edison doll, which spoke the first recorded rhymes that the public could purchase. The presentation will be at 6:30 p.m. at The History Museum at the Castle, 330 E College Ave., Appleton. The cost is $5 per person.
Diabetic neuropathy is a complication of diabetes that results in damage to the nervous system. It is a progressive disease, and symptoms get worse over time. Neuropathy happens when high levels of fats or sugar in the blood damage the nerves in the body. It can affect virtually any nerve in the body, with a wide range of symptoms. Nerves are essential to how the body works. They enable people to move, send messages about how things feel, and control automatic functions, such as breathing. There are several types.
Sibeth Ndiaye: Who is the French government's new spokeswoman? The newest member of the French government has been a citizen of France for less than three years - but now, she will speak for the country. Sibeth Ndiaye, the new government spokeswoman, was born in Dakar, Senegal, and only obtained her citizenship while helping to run President Emmanuel Macron's election campaign in 2016. But the 39-year-old's close connection to the president - and some of her comments in her time as his media advisor - have made her a target for criticism by opposition politicians.
Privacy is in a funny place at the moment. On the one hand as a society with are being more and more careless with our private data, sharing everything from photos, running stats, contacts and much more on the internet without a care in the world, on the other we are becoming more and more aware that we are being watched by "big brother" as stories like PRISM and the work of Edward Snowdon continue to make headlines. Perhaps capitalising on this, or the continual decline and demise of BlackBerry, a new security focused offering has come on to the market - this time for Android users.

BRAD HORN/Nevada Appeal Ruben Correa, of Carson City, leaps over a car to get to his vehicle near Curry Street in Carson City on Saturday. A state of emergency was declared because of the flooding. The New Year came in with a wave as Carson City and the surrounding communities found themselves battling floods and mudslides brought on by the onslaught of three moisture-packed winter storms. Carson City residents awoke Saturday to find the capital city’s main arteries flooded by fast moving rainwater that carried down the mountains trees leveled by last summer’s Waterfall fire.
Advertising has always been a creative endeavor. Back in the days of J. Walter Thompson, advertising was shaped by a client's communication objectives and budget, but was always molded into effective communication by someone charged with the creative execution. Times have changed in the past 130+ years. There are many more ways to advertise (than the religious magazines J. Walter ran ads in), many more formats (radio, video, Flash), and precision for ad placement has vastly improved (from sandwich boards on a sidewalk to the behavioral, contextual and geographic targeting we see today).

Newswise — October 27, 2017 – Plastic surgeons using social media to attract patients should know their audience's preferred social media platforms and the types of posts of greatest interest, according to a survey study in the November issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery®, the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS). "Plastic surgeons can utilize social media best by considering their target audience's perspective," said Heather Furnas, MD, of Plastic Surgery Associates of Santa Rosa, Calif. Dr. Furnas is a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
Afghanistan's National Security Council, which is chaired by President Hamid Karzai, on Sunday accused "foreign intelligence services" of being behind the deadly attack on a Kabul restaurant, in an apparent reference to Pakistan. Pakistan was the main supporter of the former Taliban regime, and Afghan officials have long voiced suspicions about the connections between the hardline movement and Islamabad's powerful intelligence services. "The NSC said such sophisticated and complex attacks are not the work of the ordinary Taliban, and said without doubt foreign intelligence services beyond the border are behind such bloody attacks," a statement from the palace said.

Aug 6 (Reuters) - Conglomerate Keppel Corp Ltd said on Monday a unit of its asset management arm had entered a memorandum of understanding with Australia’s Vicinity Centres to establish a private fund. The companies intend to invest in an initial A$1 billion ($739.40 million) portfolio of Australian retail properties currently owned by Vicinity, Keppel said in a statement, adding that the parties plan to manage the fund through a joint venture. Vicinity said it would form Vicinity Keppel Australia Retail Fund, which both companies said is subject to due diligence and the approval of their boards.
When people talk about the US National Security Agency/Central Security Service (NSA), the talk usually centers on privacy, with good reason. Still, it’s not the only subject worth discussing. The volume of data collected by the NSA and the associated costs make it the ultimate in Big Data case studies. What can it tell us about data and business? What can it tell us about business risk and the potential benefits and consequences of Big Data investments? The agency’s exact budget is a government secret, but estimates put it around $10 billion per year.
Will any party leader stand up to faith in politics? Some weeks ago I asked the leaders of all the political parties in Thursday's debate to keep religion out of the general election. I invited them first to agree with the mild and uncontentious observation that religious politics are a scourge to any nation, and then to make three simple and minimal pledges for their parties, both at national and local level. The first was not to solicit financial or electoral support on religious grounds. The second was not to give any form of special access to policy-making or campaigning to any faith group.
Dodgers pitcher Josh Beckett is set to make his season debut against the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday. Eleven months and one unusual surgery later, it’s the return of Josh Beckett. Barring something unexpected, Beckett will make his season debut Wednesday night against the Detroit Tigers. No small order -- he is essentially replacing Clayton Kershaw in the rotation. “He looks like the guy,” said Dodgers Manager Don Mattingly. Beckett has seen his comeback from summer surgery to remove a rib that was pressuring a nerve and causing finger numbness pushed back by a pair of recent injuries.
A Covington police officer who was shot Monday near a local Walmart is being transferred from Atlanta Medical Center to Grady Memorial Hospital, police said Tuesday afternoon. And although Officer Matt Cooper remains in serious condition and has a bullet lodged against his carotid artery, there is a positive development. “Matt had a good night last night,” police said in a Facebook post. “We were just informed that he mouthed the words ‘I love you’ to his wife who has not left his side. The nurse asked him, ‘Did you just tell her I love you?’ And he nodded yes.
Alnorthumbria Veterinary Group hosted three meetings for farmers in the autumn covering two subjects. The first talk was about the proper use of medicines, and the second subject was the BVD Stamp It Out campaign being run in England. A follow-up meeting for those who could not attend was held in January and it filled to overflowing South Charlton Village Hall. The practice has signed up more than its quota of farmers for the BVD Stamp It Out campaign. This involved a lot of forms to be completed on the night of the meetings and, hopefully, Anna will be able to keep on top of the necessary records going forward.
Former chief executive officer of the South African Football Association (Safa) advocate Leslie Sedibe has disputed claims made in the explosive report on match-fixing by football's international governing body Fifa that he "lost" his laptop, preventing its investigators from studying his emails. "By prior arrangement with Safa, I was in possession of my laptop after my departure," Sedibe told the Mail & Guardian. "When requested to do so, I arranged for the laptop to be returned to Safa, where it was received by the chief financial officer."
This week will mark two months since Donald Trump, then the president-elect, named Andrew Puzder as his choice to be secretary of labor. In the weeks since, most of the rest of Trump’s first batch of Cabinet nominees have, despite fits and starts and opposition from Democrats, advanced through the Senate confirmation process. Five have won approval, as many as four more could be confirmed this week, and several others should be ready to start their jobs by the middle of the month. Puzder, however, has languished.
TORONTO—Ontario’s Liberal government is considering backtracking on medical marijuana exemptions to e-cigarette rules that are so new they technically haven’t even come into effect. The turnaround came just one day after the exemption for medical marijuana users to a vaporizing law came to light. The government quietly exempted them this week from a law that bans the use of e-cigarettes anywhere regular cigarettes are prohibited. It means medical marijuana users can vaporize in restaurants, at work, or on playgrounds under the regulations that are set to come into effect Jan. 1.
U.S. senator Lindsey Graham is trying to make the most of his rare moment of zen with conservatives. The fiscally liberal warmonger – who is generally loathed by members of his own party in the Palmetto State – got back in the game with one big swing last week. Graham’s angry rebuke of Democrats looking to scuttle the U.S. supreme court nomination of federal appeals court judge Brett Kavanaugh was a home run. “Graham channeled Republican rage – and then unleashed it against Democrats at the apex of their eleventh hour assault,” we wrote. Which is true … and we don’t even like Kavanaugh.
EU flags. Credit: symbiot via Shutterstock. Vatican City, Oct 28, 2017 / 10:36 am ().- In a lengthy speech to civil and ecclesiastical leaders of Europe on Saturday, Pope Francis defended the family as being made up of a man and woman open to life – saying that this fundamental community is also a model for secular communities. “Secular communities, likewise, are alive when they are capable of openness, embracing the differences and gifts of each person while at the same time generating new life, development, labor, innovation and culture,” the Pope said Oct. 28.
Chapecoense soccer players who did not travel with their team on a flight to Colombia that crashed, mourn during a tribute to the crash victims at Arena Condado stadium in Chapeco, Brazil, Nov. 30, 2016. The Bolivian civil aviation authority has indefinitely suspended LaMia's airline operating permits after its airplane carrying a Brazilian soccer team crashed this week near Medellin, Colombia, killing 71 people. Brazilian and Bolivian news reports say an employee from the Santa Cruz de La Sierra airport in Bolivia told authorities she warned a LaMia representative the fuel onboard was insufficient in the case of an emergency.
Toy Chest Theater: Spider-Man Fails? This image makes me think of the art we saw in the aftermath of 9/11. Images of the superheroes we love, placed next to the very real heroes who rushed in to save lives and provide aid when the terrorist attacks occurred. John Romita Jr’s work in The Amazing Spider-Man #36 comes to mind, for obvious reasons. The caption on photographer Joe Hume’s Instagram page reads “Sometimes we fail.” That’s interesting, as that’s not how I read this image. Mourning? Yes. Failure?
MILWAUKEE — Giannis Antetokounmpo got turned away early but made the clutch plays late. One of the NBA's most dynamic dunkers shook off a rare rejection and helped the Milwaukee Bucks turn away the Nets’ attempt to rally from a 23-point deficit in a 129-115 win over the undermanned Nets on Saturday. Antetokounmpo had his third triple-double of the season with 31 points , 10 rebounds and 10 assists, while Khris Middleton scored 29 points, despite a quad injury. The Bucks, who have won three straight and seven of eight, extended their NBA-best record to 25-10.
UNITED NATIONS, September 7 -- As Sudan's bombing has spread from Southern Kordofan into Blue Nile State, there has been little response from or at the UN. On September 7 Inner City Press asked US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice what the US would do in the Security Council, which meets on Sudan and South Sudan on September 8, and on Sudan's request to normalize relations with the US including being taken off its state sponsors of terrorism list. Rice expressed concern, but did not address the issue of normalizing relations, nor lay out any Security Council strategy.
JUVENTUS chief Massimiliano Allegri says Wojciech Szczesny's transfer from Arsenal is not a done deal. Juve are expected to bolster their squad this summer despite storming to Serie A glory and reaching the Champions League final. The Italian heavyweights need to source a replacement for veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon who is bound for retirement. Buffon, 39 has spent 16 years in Turin and racked up nearly 500 appearances for the club. However, his time between the stick appears to be coming to an end. Szczesny, 27, is expected to replace the ageing Italian superstar.
The Ducks snapped a three-game losing streak with a 4-3 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Wednesday at Honda Center. They've now collected points in three consecutive games and are showing signs of life. The captain hasn't eclipsed 15 goals in any of the last three campaigns, but he's already up to six in 17 games after an unassisted goal on Wednesday. The All-Star center has always been capable of scoring goals in bunches, but instead usually elects to create plays for others; his vision is among the best in the game.
BMW has selected Dassault Systèmes' V6 product lifecycle management (PLM) software for its cars' future electrical, electronics, and embedded software (E/E) architecture for the next 10 years. BMW will use V6 to create a single reference address to link customer requirements to implementable functions in the car. This will also define the logical architecture of the systems and realise its physical expression as hardware and software. BMW said it chose V6, which will be used by thousands of engineers, because of its flexible PLM backbone, and its out-of-the-box, specialised functions for systems engineering.
STOCKTON - Bill Jones can't wait to head back to his old corner of Stockton 99 Speedway. Jones, who started watching races at the track almost 60 years ago, was thrilled to hear the quarter-mile oval will be reopened after a two-year hiatus. Carol and Tony Noceti of French Camp have signed a five-year lease with owners Bob Hunefeld and Ken Clapp to operate the track on Wilson Way, which is scheduled to reopen in March 2009. "It's really nice to finally have it signed and sealed," Tony Noceti said.
February 23, 2017 Basketball, Jodie Wagner. Eight Palm Beach County boys basketball teams took the court Tuesday night for the opportunity to advance in the state playoffs. Three prevailed. Wellington, Palm Beach Lakes and Oxbridge Academy won their regional semifinal contests earlier this week, and will play Friday night for berths in the Florida High School Boys Basketball State Championships in Lakeland. The Wolverines and ThunderWolves will play familiar opponents. Wellington hosts Coral Springs for the second straight year, while Oxbridge Academy travels to Tampa Catholic for the second consecutive year.
After the Anti-Defamation League criticized the latest Donald Trump campaign ad for using anti-Semitic imagery, the Trump campaign hit back at the civil rights group, accusing it of trying to find bigotry in the wrong places. The ad by the Trump campaign, first released Friday, has already garnered over 1.5 million views on YouTube. It showcases Trump’s closing “argument for America,” and uses imagery of the Federal Reserve seal, Wall Street, and piles of cash while painting a dark portrait of “elite” control of the U.S.
“That have bled our country dry,” he continues in the ad.
We all know what it is like to be weary; to be so tired that we simply cannot keep our eyes open any longer. If you nod off while curled up on the sofa binge watching your favourite show, there's no harm done, but behind the wheel of a car, the results could be horrific. Transport for NSW's Centre for Road Safety puts driver fatigue in the top three killers on the state's roads. Fatigue-related crashes are twice as likely to be fatal, according to the centre. Drivers who are asleep can't hit the brakes.
And it only takes a moment or two to complete. CONSIDERING HOW POPULAR it is, it’s probably no surprise that complaints about Facebook’s official apps tend to occur every so often. Accusations of draining battery life and data plans being used up thanks to the introduction of certain features like autoplay videos have been thrown at the app for a while now. For most people, the app should be fine, but if you find it’s causing you trouble, the best thing to do is get rid of the app and get the mobile web version instead.

We know autonomous cars are coming, but what form will they arrive in? Autonomous cars are coming. Sure we’ve still got a long way to go, especially when it comes to the ethics and safety behind them, but there’s no changing the fact that they will go into mass production in the very near future. Heck, you only need to look at the fact that an autonomous car just crossed to the continental United States to see just how close we are. But how will market for self-driving cars evolve once they do arrive?
January 26, 2016 Anthony Chiang, Florida, Football, gatorbytes, Jim McElwain, Mike White. 1. Building momentum: Good things keep happening for Florida’s men’s basketball team, which is on a three-game winning streak. On Monday, senior forward Dorian Finney-Smith was named the SEC player of the week after averaging 22 points and 10.5 rebounds in two wins last week. Today, the Gators (13-6) will look to keep the positive vibes going when they travel to take on Vanderbilt (11-8) at 9 p.m. (ESPNU). 2.
The legal farce that led to the overturning of the terrorist conviction. There has been a strong reaction to this finding, but at the same time, I'm more concerned by the implications of any backlash than I am by this finding. From the start, I'd like to make it clear that I'm not defending 'jihad' jack, I've no doubt he should have been punished in some way, but we need to keep things in perspective. Ask yourself - what did he actually do? He hasn't actually killed anyone. He hasn't raped, nor even thieved.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday in talks focusing on the Iranian presence in Syria. Early in his meeting with the Russian delegation, also attended by Israeli defense officials, Netanyahu stressed the "extraordinarily important" link between the two countries, demonstrated by "the direct meetings between myself and President Putin and between our staffs." Netanyahu announced earlier at a Cabinet meeting that Russian President Vladimir Putin had a few days ago requested the meeting with the high level delegation that includes Russia's chief of the military's General Staff, Gen. Valery Gerasimov.
First: What do I mean by “new” Urban Dressing? Well, the first run of the series had a certain hit-and-miss quality; It endeavored to take components of the city and use the Dressing-formula to depict them. Alas, cities are complex and organic and the success not always guaranteed. Then, with a certain pirate town, the series changed – away from describing a single component (like a park/temple etc. and failing to take some moving bit or another into account), instead focusing on a general theme and the means for the DM to evoke this theme.
On Wednesday, the Navy sailors of the dock landing ship USS Ashland came to the assistance of two yacht sailors who had been adrift for months in the Western Pacific. The two survivors, Jennifer Appel and Tasha Fuaiba, had attempted to sail from Hawaii to Tahiti, departing in May for a trip that would take them across the equator and the doldrums. However, on May 30 they ran into serious trouble: their motor died, leaving them dependent on sail. They continued on their course for two months before attempting to signal for help, but to no avail.
MONTEBELLO – A local disaster preparedness task force created after Hurricane Katrina held its first educational fair for residents in Montebello this weekend. State Sen. Martha Escutia, D-Norwalk, called for the creation of the task force last fall to explore how prepared the community is to deal with a major disaster. She cited a lack of coordination between federal, state and local governments in Katrina’s aftermath. She also noted a “void” when it comes to residents being prepared for a big disaster. Task force members have already met with local emergency officials.
More than 50 firefighters tackled the blaze near Waterlooville on Wednesday afternoon. Hampshire Fire and Rescue sent eight fire engines plus an aerial ladder to the scene in Sheepwash Lane. Hampshire Police are investigating after firefighters found gas canisters beneath a mound of rubbish which was on fire. They suspect arson. Have you seen missing Anthony from Hampshire?

Shatrughan Sinha will take on Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, a four-term Rajya Sabha member fielded by BJP, in the Patna Sahib seat. Actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha, who quit BJP to fight from Patna Sahib on a Congress ticket, Saturday scoffed at the saffron party’s claim that the seat has been its stronghold and said he “would have loved” to fight Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the seat. “Let them (BJP) live in fool’s paradise ... Voters of Patna Sahib will teach them a lesson,” Sinha, popularly known as ‘Bihari Babu’, said.
It was a March Break storytime with a twist at the Confederation Centre Library in Charlottetown as more than 80 people attended the first ever Drag Queen Story Time, featuring special guest Whatshername. "I think my favourite moment was walking out because this is the first time for Prince Edward Island, for many of these kids and for many of the grown-ups that they're seeing a drag queen for the very first time," said Nicholas Whalen, a.k.a. Whatshername. "That's pretty powerful not only for me but for the people experiencing it."

Just two weeks after promising signs of life from creative studio GSC Game World, it looks like post-nuclear horror FPS S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is dead for good this time. But that doesn't mean that fans of GSC's creepy Eastern Bloc survival shooting won't have anything to play. In a series of Facebook posts unveiling, former members of GSC announced the formation of new studio Vostok Games and revealed art from new title Survarium. They also divulged that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is essentially cancelled as an agreement with the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. rights holders couldn't be reached.

The 19-year-old man and 43-year-old woman were injured in an attack close to the Park Hill flats complex at around 9.45pm yesterday. South Yorkshire Police said that when officers arrived they found the injured man and he was taken to hospital for treatment. Around two hours later they received a report that a woman had also been injured in the same incident and she too was taken to hospital. Neither are believed to have suffered life threatening injuries in the incident.

Iraq War veteran turned entrepreneur wants to use his VA home loan benefits to buy a big house. But the price is higher than the VA loan limits in his area. Flying Apache helicopters together in the Ninewa Provence of Northern Iraq, Josh Cleghorn and Butch Whiting forged an unshakable brotherhood. Brought close by their shared passion for big game hunting in extreme backcountry terrain, both know that success depends on how well and how long they can endure the harsh elements. This can be said for tracking big game as well as fighting in war zones.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has "certified" that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are working to reduce risks to civilian life in Yemen -- a key step to ensuring continued US support to the coalition. Pompeo's assessment, announced Wednesday, came even as he admitted that the US believes civilian death rates at the hands of the coalition are "far too high." Under new rules, Congress requires the certification to continue allowing US air tankers to refuel Saudi and UAE warplanes. The measure comes amid a string of high-profile coalition strikes that have killed scores of civilians, many of them children.
Neutrinos are devilishly hard to detect. They're the most antisocial of particles: The ghostly things will pass right through entire planets without interacting with a single molecule. So if physicists want to learn anything about them, they have to construct super-elaborate—and super-expensive—detectors to catch even a few of the particles as they fly by. You may have heard about one of them, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica, last week after it captured traces of neutrinos from way out in space. But ... don't scientists know that neutrinos exist already?

At 71, Linda Schmidt should be enjoying retirement. But for the past two years the Perth nurse has been crippled by debt, and fighting the banks. "I just survive from day to day, black dog trotting around behind me," she told 7.30. She owes more than $3 million to half a dozen lenders. The loans cover her own home and, not one but 11, investment properties. Her superannuation has plummeted from more than $500,000 in 2012 to just $540. Now she is faced with the prospect of losing her home.
Collectively we use major anniversaries such as 9/11 to strengthen memories and burn lessons into our civic consciousness. We must never forget those we lost. We must never drop our defenses. We must be ever diligent. It is not a time that allows for much nuance or interpretation. As individuals, though, we don't require the arbitrary turning of a day on the calendar to trigger our memories. Memories have a life of their own, especially memories of horrific events like Sept. 11, 2001, and they force themselves on us at the oddest times.
It&apos;s common to hear the term "Kush" in a conversation about weed. In its base form, Kush is a pure indica strain, but OG Kush is much more of a hybrid than pure-breed. OG Kush marijuana seeds are capable of producing high-quality gardens with high-quality bud. They also have plenty of uses in the medicinal world. When we think of Kush, it&apos;s common to think of a harsh smoke that really deadens the senses. This is because Kush is a pure indica strain. OG Kush, on the other hand, produces the exact opposite effect.
In the May 11 Record I read with some concern, except for the formal sentencing, the Melissa Huckaby trial had been concluded. She entered a guilty plea and, as I am not a proponent of California's ridiculous capital punishment system, will receive, in my opinion, the maximum and appropriate punishment. One remaining item concerns me: the judge's refusal to lift the gag order. The initial gag order had merit, to ensure the jury was not tainted, to guarantee a fair and impartial trial and to protect the privacy of the Cantu family.
Moven, a mobile banking service similar in some respects to recently acquired Simple, exited from beta this week, meaning users no longer have to request an invite to sign up for an account. Now publicly available, the company is allowing users to open a bank account directly from their smartphone, which can be funded through external transfers and/or direct deposits. For background, like Simple, Moven is not a bank itself. Instead, its accounts and associated MasterCard debit card are backed by CBW Bank, an FDIC member based in Kansas.
PARIS (Reuters) - Rioters set fire to a bank and ransacked stores on Paris’s Champs Elysees avenue on Saturday, in a new flare-up of violence as France’s yellow vest protests against President Emmanuel Macron and his pro-business reforms entered a fourth month. Police fired tear gas and water cannon as the protests turned violent after weeks of relative calm, during which marches had attracted declining numbers of participants. A Banque Tarneaud branch spewed flames before firefighters arrived and rescued a woman and her infant from the building, with 11 suffering minor injuries, the fire department said.
ODELL BECKHAM Jr has signed a $95 million (£74 million) five-year extension with the New York Giants, making him the highest paid wide receiver in the NFL. Beckham is guaranteed to earn $65 million over the six seasons that he is now contracted to play for the Giants, but he could pocket a maximum of $95 million. The 25-year-old said: “Honestly, I don’t even know how to explain it...I don’t know if it’s a relief, I don’t know – it’s a combination of everything.
SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP)  An Orange County man whose investment schemes bilked doctors and others out of more than $2 million has been sentenced to federal prison. Fifty-eight-year-old David Rose of Coto de Caza was sentenced Monday to nearly five years in prison and ordered to pay restitution. He pleaded guilty in July to wire and mail fraud. Prosecutors say over a period of years, Rose got dozens of doctors, dentists and others to invest in Irvine companies that promised lucrative returns on investments in emerging medical technologies  such as a way to remove children”s wisdom teeth without surgery.
Is it time for the United States to dump Saudi Arabia? After the recent execution of Shi’ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr by Saudi Arabia, the Middle East once again risks devolving into sectarian chaos. A mob torched the Saudi Embassy in Tehran, prompting Saudi Arabia and a number of its Sunni allies to break diplomatic relations with Iran. In response to the unfolding chaos, the Wall Street Journal responded by asking “Who Lost the Saudis?” — fretting that the lack of support from the United States could lead to the overthrow of the Saudi regime.

CHRIS UHLMANN, PRESENTER: Joining me is one of Julia Gillard's staunch supporters, Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. TANYA PLIBERSEK, HEALTH MINISTER: Hi, Chris. CHRIS UHLMANN: You've just heard what Robert McClelland had to say. He's one of a number in your caucus who believes that this party is doomed under Julia Gillard. Under all the available evidence, isn't that correct? TANYA PLIBERSEK: Well I think "doomed" is very emotive language.

The two teams combined for 17 punts. MSU and Ohio State each missed a field goal. EAST LANSING — Michigan State football appeared ready to take Ohio State into another fourth-quarter fight. Then Mark Dantonio opted to take a safety instead of punting out of his own end zone with a freshman punter. And everything unraveled from there. With backup quarterback Rocky Lombardi in the game, the Spartans fumbled on their next two offensive plays. The first was a snap in the end zone that bounced off in-motion receiver Laress Nelson that Ohio State pounced on for a touchdown.
As the pop group Girls Aloud ran through a sound check on the other side of the curtain, lecturers in the main hall at the Bournemouth International Centre tried to block out the music and concentrate on the matter in hand. In front of them was a motion calling for a nationwide debate on a proposed academic boycott of Israeli universities in protest at the continued occupation of the Palestinian territories. As the discussions rumbled on, most of those in the hall for the University and College Union’s (UCU) first annual conference on May 30 realised their decision would have ramifications beyond British academia.
An AvWeek headline this week posed a question that once had an easy, one-word answer: No. The question was, per David A. Fulghum and Bill Sweetman: "Are there alternatives to the F-35 program?" But in post-super committee America, where the Air Force daydreams about growing its fleet with a service-life extension program for the Wright Flyer , things aren't as clear cut as they used to be. Back in the old days we used to say, c'mon, there's just too much riding on this to seriously contemplate it going away. It's the largest defense program in history.
From a seller of digital advertising:A friend of mine who is a media director at one of the large digital agencies told me earlier in the week that corporate has mandated they utilize their buying desk. A media plan that had been put together and approved by the agency's client was partially scrapped (and with it my part of the plan). This would seem to put the needs of the agency in front of the needs of the client. Is this what is happening in the wider agency-client world? If so, aren't media teams hampered by corporate mandates such as this?
There were reports of congestion inside Grand Central as the incident was causing delays for the evening rush. A person was struck and killed by a Metro-North train in the Bronx Monday afternoon, causing delays forthe evening rush. The individual, who was not immediately identified, was hit "about 3:30 p.m. by a northbound train passing through the Botanical Garden station at Bedford Park and Kazimiroff Blvds," the New York Daily News reported. The Daily News added that the death was likely a suicide. Trains were bypassing all Bronx stations, causing delays, and large crowds inside Grand Central, NBC New York reported.

Nanhui, one of China's 285 purpose-built eco-cities. Two hundred and eighty-five. That’s the number of new purpose-built eco-cities that China claims to be developing. This is not a joke or an ironic jest at a country that has garnered a global reputation for rendering itself an ecological wasteland. This is a very real development that is taking place in a China that is attempting to rapidly transition and stabilize on many fronts. What started out as a few experimental developments to test new green urban design and technological systems has turned into an all out movement.
Calculate the years of service members of the Warren Engine Company No. 1 have contributed to the community and it’s pretty impressive. Their service spans at least six centuries and the company’s original roll book first signed June 17, 1863, now holds the signatures of 383 volunteers. Lawrence Jacobson, of Fallon, served 60 years in Douglas County. Paul Webster, the company’s vice-president, says even though there is a decline in volunteer firefighting compared to earlier this century he expects the numbers in Warren Engine Company to continue to grow because of its strong tradition in Carson City and with the families involved.

James Corden kicked off his new stint as host of The Late Late Show in style last night, bringing in plenty of big name talent and at least one video that is sure to go viral. His first guests included Mila Kunis and Tom Hanks, the later of which re-enacted every one of his movie roles in 8 minutes alongside the host. Also coming onboard for the big night was James Corden's Into the Woods co-star Meryl Streep, who was joined by Arnold Schwarzenegger in a taped skit that showed James Corden getting into shape for his grueling new job as a nightly talk show host.
FLEURY-MEROGIS, France — The man was sent to France’s largest prison for armed robbery. He emerged a toughened radical who would go on to take part in the bloodiest terrorist attacks on French soil in decades. France’s prisons have a reputation as factories for radical Islamists, taking in ordinary criminals and turning them out as far more dangerous people. Here at the Fleury-Merogis prison — where Amedy Coulibaly did time alongside another of the attackers in the deadly assaults this month in and around Paris — authorities are struggling to quell a problem that they say was long threatening to explode.

Early this year, at a White House event, Trump had said he was satisfied with the Indian decision to reduce the import tariff on Harley-Davidson motorcycles from 100% to 50%. Describing India as a “very-high tariff nation”, US President Donald Trump has told his supporters he wants a “reciprocal tax” or at least “some kind of tax” on goods entering America. “India is a very high-tariff nation. They charge us a lot,” the president said, amidst a temporary truce between the US and China over tariffs.

Why are you running for office? I was inspired to run for the legislature out of a sense of service to my community. Everything that happens in Augusta impacts everyone in Maine, from the taxes we pay to the education we provide for our children.

The Speaker of the House selected me as one of only two freshman legislators to serve on a special committee charged to find ways to support and grow our workforce and our economy.
7A-CENTRAL BOYS Bradshaw-led Conway snaps three-game skid by Tim Cooper | February 7, 2018 at 2:18 a.m.
CONWAY -- Shorthanded Conway managed to top North Little Rock, again. Senior 6-7 center Blake Bradshaw scored 22 points as the Wampus Cats snapped a three-game losing streak with a 68-60 victory over the Charging Wildcats in a 7A-Central Conference contest at Buzz Bolding Arena. It was Conway's third victory over North Little Rock in as many tries this season. Sophomore Caleb London, Conway's leading scorer, played only sparingly and 6-2 junior Terry Clardy, the team's second leading scorer, did not play at all.
Using a dominant ball-control offence and a few gambles that paid off, the Saints got two touchdown passes from Drew Brees and two interceptions from Marcus Lattimore in a 20-14 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. Thomas’ touchdown capped an 18-play, 92-yard drive in which the Saints actually covered more than 100 yards because of penalties. It lasted 11 1/2 minutes. Indeed, the visitors were in control until Lattimore picked off Foles’ deep throw to Zach Ertz. The Saints showed plenty of moxie on their 79-yard march to a touchdown, faking a punt at their 30, with Taysom Hill running 4 yards for a first down.
When there�s a packed house and a conference championship at stake, as there was Tuesday night at Shelby�s Lloyd Little Gym, the team that settles down to play its game first usually has the best chance to win. The host Golden Lions let East dictate the tempo of the game early, but Shelby came on full bore in the second half to claim a 67-60 triumph and take control of the South Mountain Athletic Conference race.

Blake Lively reveals why she doesn't work with a stylist | HELLO! October 24, 2016 - 15:36 BST hellomagazine.com "I don't understand why people make a fuss over that"
Blake Lively regularly tops the best-dressed lists with her incredible style, but unlike many of her peers, the actress has revealed that she doesn't work with a stylist. The Gossip Girl star has a refreshingly down-to-earth approach to fashion, and admits she doesn't think it's impressive that she curates all of her outfits for press tours and the red carpet.
Industry groups have warned oil and gas companies could pull their money out of New Orleans, including major corporate sponsorships, because the city has filed a lawsuit seeking damages for coastal wetlands losses. Two major events, the French Quarter Festival and Jazz Fest, have energy companies as their main sponsors. So far, the companies have not announced changes to those arrangements. Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s legal team filed suit Friday (March 30) seeking damages from Entergy and 10 oil and gas companies for coastal wetlands loss. Chevron, which is one of the defendants, has been title sponsor the French Quarter Festival since 2013.
Three journalists picked up by coalition forces or the Afghan intelligence service for their suspected links to Taliban propaganda networks have been freed after brief detentions that prompted angry reaction from journalism advocates and President Hamid Karzai’s call for their quick release. NATO said Friday that it had released Mohammad Nadir, a television cameraman for al-Jazeera, and Rahmatullah Naikzad. “After reviewing the initial intelligence and information received during questioning, the two men were not considered a significant security threat and were released,” said Rear Adm. Gregory Smith, communications director for the NATO-led military coalition.

Derby boss Paul Jewell ridiculed claims the club have sold teenage star Giles Barnes to West Ham for £5million. Barnes was linked with a move to the Hammers over the summer, with an apparent £3.5million offer rejected at the time, and now it has been suggested boss Alan Curbishley has finally landed the 19-year-old, who will move to Upton Park when the transfer window opens next week. When asked about the Barnes deal, Jewell replied: "Very nice. It's a nice Christmas present - I just wish I knew about it. Maybe Santa Claus will drop the cheque down the chimney!"
Childbirth illustrates the life-giving sacrifice of body, mind, and soul that applies to us all. The call to service and sacrifice can be difficult enough without bringing our bodies into it. And yet, there it is in Scripture, an invitation to “to present our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God.” (Rom. 12:1, ESV). Paul describes physical sacrifice as our “spiritual act of worship.” He unifies our spiritual with our physical selves, grounding the spirit in real life and making sacred the body. Many of us have an ambivalent relationship with our physical forms.
Should Investors Take a Look at Makita? Japanese power tool manufacturer Makita (MKTAY) brings a reputation for producing quality products into its battle for global tool sales against U.S. company Stanley Black & Decker (SWK). Investors should not worry about the somewhat strange ticker symbol for the Makita shares trading as an American Depositary Receipt (ADR); the stock provides solid, if cyclical value. Makita is best known for its hand power tools, and those tools generated more than 70 percent of the company's sales. The balance of sales is split between garden and household power products and replacement parts sales.
Wasi Mohsin| A migrant camp in Paris. Paris city authorities moved in early Wednesday to start clearing out a makeshift migrant camp holding up to 1,500 people in the French capital that had become a focal point in the country’s immigration debate. Officials began clearing the so-called Millénnaire tent camp on the city's edge alongside a canal used by joggers and cyclists. It is the largest of several around Paris. Two migrants drowned this month in canals along the encampments. City authorities said the migrants, mainly from Africa, will be taken to gymnasiums in the Paris region.
Simon Mignolet likes to be understated. It is not always easy for a man of 6ft 4in with an athlete's physique to melt into the background but Sunderland's goalkeeper does his very best. Eschewing the typical "look at me" performance cars complete with personalised number plates and blacked-out windows commonly favoured by Premier League footballers, the Belgium international prefers the more subtle lines of an Audi A4. Ask him about the intense swotting involved in the degree in political sciences he is poised to achieve this summer and Mignolet moves into full-on modesty mode.
THE UNITED STATES and Russia have descended to a new low point in relations, with waves of sanctions and escalating retaliation. Twenty-five years after the Cold War ended, relations are back in a deep freeze. What happened? The current tension did not come about because the United States suddenly wanted its old adversary back. What happened is a response to bad choices taken by President Vladimir Putin of Russia. These choices were made deliberately in Moscow, perhaps for Mr. Putin’s own reasons of domestic politics and foreign policy. They are the main reason for the tension that now exists.
STOCKTON - A group of south Stockton merchants who have complained about what they see as racial profiling and intimidation by law enforcement officers on and around Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard now say their concerns persist, but that they are working to collaborate with authorities so that better relationships can be developed. Representatives from the group of about 70 business owners - they call themselves the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Merchants Association - have said that Stockton Police and California Highway Patrol officers have been unfairly targeting Latino drivers in the neighborhoods surrounding their businesses.
Ranchi's HEC Township Sector III roundabout became a hub of buzzing voices on Friday as curious onlookers gathered around a man on a cycle fitted with display boards carrying literacy messages. Meet 46-year-old Aditya Kumar from Uttar Pradesh, who reached Ranchi on Friday after pedalling across the country for over two years motivating children to go to school. Dubbed cycle guruji, Aditya earned a place in the Limca Book of Records in 2014 for cycling to slums in an around Lucknow since 1995 to teach children there. He's also earned accolades from Uttar Pradesh governor Ram Naik and then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.
Frisco is broken. My friends shake their heads and ask “What’s happening in Frisco, why you at are war again?” Giving that some thought, I recount my first-hand experience with the Peak One process. All started fine, with well-attended public meetings where citizens prioritized needs and visualized a livable, attractive neighborhood. This was developed into the Peak One Master Plan. Then the trouble. Early this year, the town drafted and adopted the zoning laws governing the Peak One development. In this process, a transformation occurred with the result being Peak One zoning that is way too dense!
A new development designed by the architects Ron and Jim Vari, 33rd Street Square acknowledges both past and present in rapidly changing Bridgeport. The cutouts and big modular panels give the place a contemporary feel, while the red-brick construction recalls the neighborhood’s traditional housing. The development (at 33rd Street and South Parnell Avenue) also positions every unit to take advantage of the two best local views: the fireworks over U.S. Cellular Field and the city skyline. Each of the 11 units has one upper-floor terrace looking south and another looking north.
Current and former intelligence officials say it is standard practice to suspend a clearance pending the outcome of an investigation. Yet in the case of Cheryl Mills, Clinton’s former chief of staff at the State Department, two letters indicate this practice is not being followed — even as the Clinton email system remains the subject of an FBI investigation. A second letter dated Feb. 18, 2016, from the State Department’s assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Julia Frifield, provided additional details to Grassley about the “administrative error.” It, too, confirmed Mills maintained the top secret clearance.
PARIS (AP) — On the morning of March 19, 2016, Den Katenberg ran a little test with big stakes. The previous week, Katenberg's hacking crew had been bombarding the Hillary Clinton campaign's email accounts with fake Google warnings, trying to get her Brooklyn-based staff to panic, enter their passwords and open their digital lives to Russia's intelligence services. But the going was tough. Even when Clinton staffers clicked the malicious links Katenberg crafted, two-factor authentication — a second, failsafe password test — still kept him out of their accounts.
The Stanford women’s and men’s tennis teams each grabbed home wins this past weekend in dual match play at Taube Family Tennis Stadium. The No. 4 Stanford women’s tennis team crushed the No. 7 Vanderbilt Commodores 6-1 on Saturday afternoon in a rematch of the 2018 NCAA title game, and the No. 6 Stanford men’s tennis team came back from behind to take down the No. 40 California Golden Bears 4-2 after dropping the day’s first doubles match.

Nancy Pelosi has been serving as the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives since 2011. Prior to that, she served as the Speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011 and the Minority Leader from 2003 to 2007. She has served 16 terms in Congress as a representative from California since 1993 and is about to serve her 17th term in 2019. Pelosi was the first woman to be the leader of either chamber of congress. Her ascent to Speaker of the House made her the highest-ranking female politician in U.S. history. During and after her tenure as speaker, her power and high position became contentious.
The chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa is calling for the resignation of a state legislator — a Democrat accused of fudging his address and getting reduced school tuition rates for his children. A special investigation by the state auditor concluded State Representative Kerry Burt, a Democrat from Waterloo, misstated his home address and saved $37,000 in tuition and fee for his children to attend the Price Lab School at the University of Northern Iowa. Matt Strawn, the chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, says Burt has shown a "lack of respect for the law" and should immediately resign from the legislature.
"It’s just one of those things where kind of the good pitching can be contagious but at the same time the bad pitching can be contagious," Brach said. "I think now we’re ready to get on a little bit of a roll and hopefully seven innings can go a long way to the next game." "I didn’t feel a pop or any tingling or any numbness or anything like that," Lester said. "Just kind of felt like something was in there grabbing me a little bit.
Justin Dearborn, chief executive officer of publishing company Tronc Inc., has lowered the price on his Naples, Fla., home to $409,900, down from $419,000. That’s the fourth price-chop the one-story house has received this year. Hmm … can you say motivated seller? Built in 2004, the home opens to a furnished floor plan lined with stone tiles. A living room, a dining area, a kitchen with a breakfast bar, two bedrooms and two bathrooms fill out the 2,074-square-foot floor plan. Out back, a paver patio wraps around a swimming pool.
Armenian newspapers report that President Robert Kocharian subjected to harsh criticism the Yerevan municipality at a meeting on Friday. “You won’t find a single person in Yerevan who believes that land auctions [held by the mayor’s office] are fair,” “Hayastani Hanrapetutyun” quotes Kocharian as saying. He said the process is riddled with corruption and will now be closely watched by his Oversight Service. According to “168 Zham,” the meeting sparked rumors that Mayor Yervand Zakharian has been sacked. But the paper says they were denied by Kocharian’s spokesman, Victor Soghomonian.
The Obama administration today unveiled its proposal for how it intends to reduce climate-changing pollutants under a U.N. agreement. Its contents are not particularly bold or surprising, but at least it’s on time! The U.N. had asked countries for their proposals by today and the vast majority haven’t met the deadline. The proposal reaffirms that, by 2025, the U.S. will cut greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels. That’s pretty much just what was expected — the same commitment the U.S. made in its bilateral deal with China last fall.
4 × three = Required Please enter the correct value. Is Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) playing us all for Muppets when they say stocks now present a generational buying opportunity? The investment bank's 40-page bullish report, titled "The Long Good Buy: The Case for Equities," says to forget the huge run-up since 2009, forget the 25% rise in equities over the last five-and-a-half months, and forget bonds. This party is just getting started. Are they right? Yes, they are. Should you heed their advice and sell your bonds and load up the truck with equities?
Kris Humphries filed legal documents demanding that Kim Kardashian reveal how much they earned during their 72-day marriage, RadarOnline reported. The New Jersey Nets player is accusing his soon-to-be ex-wife of breaching fiduciary duty because she has not handed over financial records for the time that they were together. "Kris feels that Kim hasn&apos;t given an honest and accurate accounting of money they made while they were married," a source told the gossip site. "Kris has complied with turning over his bank records, credit card statements, but Kim hasn&apos;t, and she has been stalling."
Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria on Saturday used his tour to Wajir County together with ODM leader Raila Odinga to market his presidential ambition. Mr Kuria and Mr Odinga joined Wajir Woman Representative Fatuma Gedi to launch a series of women empowerment activities. Other politicians at the event were MPs Junet Mohamed (Suna East), Abdulswammad Nassir (Mvita), and Mombasa governor Hassan Joho. On Facebook, Mr Kuria captioned the photos with a curious choice of words. "My delegation has landed safely in Wajir." The post also had hashtags #MK2022 and #KaziNaPesa.
Juniper Networks and Symantec said Thursday that they were investigating a widespread cyber-espionage incident that has hit dozens of technology companies, including Google and Adobe. Sources familiar with the situation say that 34 companies, most of them large Fortune 500 names, were hit by a sophisticated cyber-attack, first uncovered by Google last month. The attackers used a previously unknown "zero-day" attack on Internet Explorer, and possibly other techniques, to break into company networks and steal sensitive information. The Washington Post reports that Yahoo, Dow Chemical and Northrop Grumman were also attacked.
A large crowd turned out for tonight’s town hall meeting with Congressman Warren Davidson in Troy. Protesters disrupted a town hall meeting with Congressman Warren Davidson, R-Troy, in Troy Tuesday night. The group eventually was forced to leave the event where the congressman was talking about issues such as health care, Syria and Russia. The private event was hosted by Miami County Liberty, a conservative group. Opponents walked out of the event after about an hour when they were told to leave for being disruptive. The group chanted “we are the people” as they left the event held at the Concord Room.
Over the weekend, MG Siegler at TechCrunch started a meme about why everyone is hating on Google nowadays. Siegler's conclusion: Everyone hates Google because it's trying to do everything all at once. Maybe. Google certainly is trying a lot of different businesses, but that's not really anything new. It's been doing that for years. And really, as Danny Sullivan points out, there's nothing wrong with that. Dan Lyons of Newsweek has a better reason for why everyone hates Google now, and it's pretty simple: "I would point out one thing.
Members of the Cornell Presidential Search Committee listen to community input on important qualities for the next president. Members of the Cornell community requested that the presidential search committee select a University leader who values transparency and will promote the humanities at two open forums on campus Wednesday. The open forum — which the committee held in an effort to make the search process more inclusive — sought input from Cornellians about the attributes that the committee should seek in a president. Zubrow said these criteria will be published by the committee when they have been finalized.
TORONTO (AP) — As the cast and makers of "Stronger" collectively rose to take a bow after the film's Toronto International Film Festival premiere, Jake Gyllenhaal realized that Jeff Bauman, whom he plays in the film and who wears prosthetic legs, was still sitting, overwhelmed with emotion. "Jake was like, 'Get up!'" Bauman said. "And I stood up." "As soon as he got up, everyone else stood up," Gyllenhaal said. "I realized: This movie just showed them everything he went through just for that moment.
Even the most optimistic forecaster would have had a tough time predicting the amount of success U.S. runners would experience in 2009. But indeed it was a good year, a year with a world championships in Berlin inspiring many top performances and a new sense of American self-worth among distance runners. That was fueled in part by the Olympic medal performances of Deena Kastor and Meb Keflezighi and continued success in the sprints. The excitement truly began at the Reebok Boston Indoor Games in February. Shalane Flanagan, a 2008 Olympic bronze medalist, ran 14:47.62 to shatter Marla Runyan’s U.S. 5,000-meter record of 15:07.33 from 2001.
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The parents of US aid worker Peter Kassig, who Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claimed to have beheaded, said Sunday they were awaiting official confirmation on the death of their "treasured son". "We are aware of the news reports being circulated about our treasured son and are waiting for confirmation from the government as to the authenticity of these reports," Ed and Paula Kassig said in a statement. The ISIS group released a video Sunday claiming the killing, showing a masked militant standing over a severed head whom the militant said was Kassig.
One would expect that Christians, Muslims, Jews and other religious people would be offended by new “GodBlock” software aimed at removing Biblical references from children’s computer screens. But a number of atheists don’t like the tool either. American Atheists is the leading organization in the U.S. fighting for the total separation of church and state, and dates its founding to 1963. Atheists, a largely misunderstood group, generally pride themselves on favoring the free flow of ideas. “We shouldn’t be like them,” Silverman said.

Why are Chinese buyers snapping up so much Australian property? Chinese investment in Australian property is on the rise. But why? And is that even legal? Crikey intern Sunny Liu reports.

Chief Sephardic Rabbi Shlomo Amar says the torching of a mosque in the northern Arab village of Tuba Zangaria may have not been committed by Jews, and that the attempt to ascribe the act to "price tag" activists is basically a "blood libel". Speaking in an interview to Radio Kol Hai, Amar said the speculations were premature, but that "we have no way of knowing if this wasn't a malicious act aimed at inflaming the conflict and increasing the hatred between Jews and Arabs." The rabbi, who visited the burned mosque on Monday afternoon, explained: "We are experienced people.
An M25 service station that was sealed off by emergency services after a chemical accident has reopened. The South Mimms Service Station was closed at around 2pm after the Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service and Hertfordshire Constabulary were called to a chemical spill in the car park. Herts Police warned motorists on Twitter to expect the service station to remain closed for several hours.

Ekiti State had raised N20 billion in the first tranche in 2012.
Most of the 32 artists, all with some connection to Maine, have never participated in the show before. Alison Ferris had two goals when she chose artists for the Portland Museum of Art biennial: She wanted to include artists who had never participated, and she wanted the work to represent a variety of media. In the end, she chose 32 artists with connections to Maine, of whom only three have shown in the every-other-year survey of contemporary art. And for the first time, the biennial will include Maine Indian basketmakers. The museum announced its selection of artists this week.
podcasting is an incredibly community-driven medium. From the outside, podcasting can seem like a solitary sport, especially if it's a one-person operation like mine. I plan, host and produce my show, Write Now, from my home office, where I spend long hours surrounded by towels, my ears encased in headphones, speaking into a homemade tube of audio foam. I'm usually wearing sweatpants and so full of coffee that my eyes are bloodshot. So from the outside, I get that podcasting looks about as communal as it does glamorous (i.e., not at all).
Nor Cal Corgi Con brought 475 corgis to San Francisco's Ocean Beach on June 27, 2015. Break out your Corgi's most regal raiments — the Nor Cal Corgi Con is returning to San Francisco this weekend. The "PUPular" event last took place in June, and brought nearly 500 dogs to Ocean Beach to frolic, play and splash in the waves, and to go head-to-head in Corgi-themed competitions. This week's canine conference will be held on the beach once again, across the street from Beach Chalet restaurant (at 1000 Great Highway), between stairwell #21 and Fulton Street.
Hollywood’s “contempt and dismissiveness” toward women have led her to Broadway. In “The Parisian Woman,” she’ll be onstage for every minute of every scene. This week, the actress tells the story of a family’s shattering secret. Ms. Thurman says this political drama, by Beau Willimon, the creator of “House of Cards,” is contemporary, sharp and witty. The actress is putting up for sale her duplex at 1 Lexington Avenue, the prewar co-op building where she lived for several years.
MILE JEDINAK hailed wonderkid Wilfried Zaha after Crystal Palace broke their 2012 duck. Palace’s £7m-rated Zaha is known for his silky raids down the flank. But the teenage winger went from showman to workman by inspiring Palace to their first league win of the year after breaking the deadlock in a rout against woeful Watford. Australian midfielder Jedinak said: “You can’t question Wilf’s effort and he is a joy to play with. “He is maturing as a player and knows what it’s now about. He is starting to understand it’s a team game after all.

OROQUIETA CITY, Misamis Occidental, Jan. 10 (PIA) -- All types of shellfish and “alamang”” or shrimp paste, commonly called “uyap” or “uyabang” gathered from Murcielagos Bay at the boundary of Misamis Occidental in region 10 and Zamboanga del Norte, region 9, are still unsafe for human consumption. This warning was noted in Shellfish Bulletin No. 1, series of 2012, of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), after the latest laboratory results showed that the shellfish collected in the area are positive for paralytic shellfish poison that is beyond the regulatory limit.
NOW congratulates the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences for adopting its new Standards of Conduct, to which each of its 8,427 members are expected to adhere. The time has come for Alabama women to be a political power in the state. We can make the difference in the upcoming Senate election. Let’s look at the history of women’s political participation in Alabama. The 19th Amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote was approved by the U.S. Congress in 1919, and ratified by three-quarters of the states by 1920. But, sadly, Alabama didn’t ratify the 19th Amendment until 1953.
About 150 people participated in an airplane crash disaster drill yesterday at the A-B-E Airport, which brought both praise and criticism from officials involved. The test simulated a crash in which 43 people were either injured or killed. The first of the injured was removed by ambulance within 50 minutes from the first call, according to Dr. George Moerkirk, the medical director for Lehigh County C.D. All injured were removed over the next hour. Two buses were used to simulate sections of the plane that had broken apart. Old parts from planes had been scattered around. Lehigh County C.D.
December 8, 2008, 11:59 p.m. The coffee grounds from three weekend mornings straight of holiday party hangovers; scraps of the cardboard box containing the Snuggie sent from your Aunt Rosemary; pine needles fallen from the parched Douglas Fir shoved into the corner of your living room; orange rinds; chestnut shells. Sound like the ingredients for some kind of witchy-poo holiday brew? These trash-bound odd and ends may seem prime candidates for a stinky seasonal potion concocted at the Hogwarts School, but in reality they’re ideal for a compost bin or pile, not a cauldron.

Once upon a time, there was a silver-tongued president. His foreign policy must have been seen by enemies of the United States as weak and feckless, because these enemies became emboldened. Mideast terrorists staged a brutal, bloody attack in which innocent Americans were killed. The president’s response could be seen as a display of shameful weakness rather than steely resolve. I’m referring, of course, to Ronald Reagan and the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, which claimed 241 American lives — and led Reagan to withdraw U.S. forces from Lebanon.
The pictures don't lie, folks. Here is Lindsay Lohan’s latest mug shot, taken at the Santa Monica Police Station on March 19 in Santa Monica, Calif. Lindsay was ordered to turn herself in for booking after pleading no contest to the charge of reckless driving, providing false information to an officer and willfully resisting, obstructing or delaying an officer. Lindsay. Girlfriend. Brush your hair before your booking photo. Didn’t your previous 400 arrests teach you anything? Is Corey Feldman moonlighting as a sperm donor?
Vice President Mike Pence's planned walkout at the Colts game over an expression of free speech is chilling. INDIANAPOLIS – North Korea and its nukes can wait. The White House has declared war on the NFL. And on the First Amendment. Two weeks after President Trump decreed that NFL players who kneel during the national anthem should be fired, Vice President Mike Pence walked out of Lucas Oil Stadium on Sunday after about 20 members of the San Francisco 49ers knelt during the anthem. The 49ers were in town to play the Indianapolis Colts. Pence was in town to upstage Peyton Manning.

Fab.com has acquired assets from myFab, a home decor and designer furniture portal in France, to build out its European business into that country. The story was first reported by the French-language Journal du Net, which pegs the deal at €3.1 million ($4.3 million), with possible additional payouts over time.

The Hurriyat said although the NIA has an office in Srinagar, it has deliberately asked the Masjid and school officials to come to Delhi to “further harass and trouble them”. The NIA has sent notices to Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid and the Islamia School, both old Valley institutions of religion and education and both linked to the family of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq. The notices have been sent days after separatist leaders were questioned on alleged terror funding from Pakistan. The Mirwaiz presides over the Friday prayers at the mosque in Srinagar and the Islamia School was founded by his family over a century ago.
It’s our favourite time of the week – a step back in time to reflect on the changes in our region, the faces and the fun that was being had during the summer months of January and February, 1998. There was a lot going on in the region at the time. The 100 year milestone of the arrival of the first train in town was celebrated. Local boys Leigh Cavanagh, Sonja Satie and Jonathan Spencer joined scouts across Australia in Brisbane for 10 days to make up part of the South West troop.
This is an article that should start with the words “once upon a time,” because it tells a wonderful tale that is sure to gladden the heart, leaving you with that “happily ever after” feeling, except that this isn’t a fairy tale at all. It is the story of Las Delicias Patisserie, a wonderful artisan bakery producing high end goodies that are sure to put a smile on your face, and in a twist that is worthy of a truly fabulous bedtime story, many of their insanely delicious products just so happen to be gluten free.

Authorities in Pakistan have banned protests and rounded up hundreds of lawyers, opposition politicians and other activists before a planned rally against the government in the capital. Protesters want to reinstate the country's former Supreme Court chief justice, and their rallies also could further weaken Pakistan's embattled government. Prominent human rights activist Tahira Abdullah was arrested at her home in Islamabad. "They came very early in the morning just after dawn," said Abdullah. "They came in a huge truck full of police men, plus two police women, plus a plain clothes intelligence agent and a magistrate.
Elizabeth Warren�s opposition to the Secure Communities program puts her out-of-step with the Massachusetts people, our sheriffs and even President Barack Obama. This program is a simple step to assist law enforcement, but Ms. Warren is more concerned about protecting violent illegal immigrants than the average citizen she hopes to represent. Secondly, Ms. Warren supports raising almost every tax on the book, including Social Security and capital gains. These taxes hit every sector of working Americans, either directly or through their participation in retirement savings plans. New taxes will slow economic recovery by burdening businesses with additional spending and making it harder for them to hire new employees.
Via Richard Kirsch, here’s an interesting juxtaposition courtesy of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. They set out to calculate the number of workers with “good jobs,” and they set a fairly low bar. A good job is one that pays $37,000 (the median wage for men in 1979), includes at least some health insurance, and some kind of retirement plan. It doesn’t have to be generous health coverage or a generous retirement plan. Mediocre health plans with big copays still count, and modest 401(k) retirement plans count.
Blackhawks general manager Stan Bowman has a week to go until the Feb. 25 trade deadline, but he has been active throughout the season. He made one blockbuster and two seemingly minor deals over the last three months. Here’s a look at those deals and each player’s likely future impact on the Hawks. Nov. 25: Forwards Dylan Strome and Brendan Perlini acquired from the Coyotes for Nick Schmaltz. Strome: The No. 3 pick in the 2015 draft had an immediate impact on the Hawks, quickly establishing himself as a core player.
Discussion in 'Grappling Technique' started by Aprentice, Aug 26, 2015. Im a blue belt whos been training for almost 4 years. for about 3 of those years i competed as much as i could and trained about twice a day. In the last of those years, i had to train a bit less, but still almost every day, and I stopped competing. Both because I was a bit tired form competing (specially after I came extremely close to medaling in pans, which would have been a dream for me) but mainly because of work, and life in general.
Arbaaz Khan, whose debut production Dabangg rocked the box office in 2010, says he is attempting to make its sequel diametrically different from the original. The filmmaker says there is going to be no competition between the two. Read on. Actor-filmmaker Arbaaz Khan, whose debut production Dabangg rocked the box office in 2010, says he is attempting to make its sequel diametrically different from the original. There is going to be no competition between the two, says Arbaaz. "When I did the first one, my intention was to tell a story which I believe in...which I was excited about.
Top Illinois Senate leaders are at odds over how quickly lawmakers should move ahead with creating a special election to fill U.S. Senate seat vacancies. Senate President John Cullerton, D-Chicago, said Thursday that his legal staff is reviewing an opinion issued Wednesday night by Attorney General Lisa Madigan that says it's constitutional for lawmakers to approve a special election. Cullerton said the Senate will not act on special election legislation until that review is done and senators see what proposal is approved by the House. Last week, Gov. Pat Quinn said he supported a House measure calling for a special election.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi asked South Korea on Friday to resolve the issue of an advanced US missile defense system deployed on the peninsula. Wang made the request in bilateral talks with his South Korean counterpart, Kang Kyung-wha, in Singapore on the margins of annual ASEAN-hosted sessions, according to a South Korean government official. He cited the need for a "compete resolution" to the matter, a repeat of Beijing's demand, which comes amid a peace mood in Korea. The US military sent a THAAD battery to a southern region of South Korea last year to counter the North's continued provocations at that time.

After six decades in which advertising has been indelibly associated with the East Side of Manhattan, ''Madison Avenue'' is moving west. Earlier this week, the Ogilvy Group and N. W. Ayer formally announced that they would move into a new building at 49th Street and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. These relocations westward follow the southward shift of several large agencies, which began about five years ago. Only two of the nation's 16 largest agencies, Young & Rubicam and DDB Needham, remain on Madison Avenue.
While seemingly everyone in the TV and media buying communities sits around waiting for the upfront ad sales market to start, I'm finally seeing some hints that NBC won't exactly get primetime rates for its new 10 p.m. "The Jay Leno Show," which breaks from the broadcast tradition by putting one show -- and not a drama! -- on at that hour, five nights a week. While NBC denies this, per a story in Mediaweek, one unidentified agency exec says that agencies are looking for a "blended price" (love the terminology there!
If the rumours circulating the tech world this morning are to be believed, then Facebook is currently working on its own smartphone device and has recruited ex-Apple employees familiar with the iPhone and iPad to help out. Of course the idea of a Facebook phone isn’t new. Zuckerberg and the team have been working away on “Project Buffy” since long before the partnership with HTC that saw a pair of handsets ship with dedicated Facebook buttons. But now a new report from the New York Times suggests Facebook’s ambitious (but completely unsurprising) hardware ambitions are growing once again.
Here’s a question: What if not a single story had been reported about LeBron since the day he crapped out of the playoffs? And tonight he released a one-sentence statement on which team he’d chosen? How would things be any different? Interesting question! It comes at the end of the column, after 750 words recounting all the stages of LeBron’s free-agent courtship to demonstrate how tired Mitch Albom is of the whole story. Mitch Albom cannot stand it when people write about stuff before it actually happens .
After years operating out of Tallangatta’s old police station, residence and court house – with their depot hundreds of metres away – the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning is upgrading to new $10.3 milllion facility. DELWP Forest Fire Management’s regional manager Aaron Kennedy said the new building would bring their offices and the depot together under one roof, allowing for increased efficiency. “It’s a fantastic announcement for Fire Forest Management Victoria, local staff and it’s a great announcement for the community,” he said.

Hopes for slice of 400,000 premise market in Australia. UK-based Satellite Solutions Worldwide Group has bought Brisbane internet provider SkyMesh, giving the British company a foothold in what it believes is a growing rural broadband solutions market in Australia. SSW also acquired Breiband in Norway, another retail service provider that specialises in rural and remote areas. The acquisitions of the Norwegian and Australian service providers more than doubles SSW's current customer numbers to 75,000. SkyMesh has 28,000 customers currently. The NBN Sky Muster satellite service, which became operational in April this year, gives SSW a total potential market size in Australia of 400,000 premises, the company said.
The BBCOR measures the bat’s bounciness: its “trampoline effect.” The bats being used this year have less of it, to keep baseballs’ exit speed down. Specifically, it has a smaller sweet spot and is more like the wooden bats that Major League Baseball players use. And that’s changed the high school game. “If you square it up, the ball is still going to jump,” said Apex coach Mike Valder. It appears as though players are having a harder time with that. “The difficulty is squaring it up.
Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos pegged Prime subscribers at 100 million. One analyst thinks the number will go much, much higher. One of the biggest draws for some Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) shoppers is the company's Prime loyalty program. What began as essentially free two-day shipping now provides a host of benefits including free streaming music and video, e-books, and exclusive savings at Whole Foods. Members are also granted entry to Amazon's annual members-only Prime Day sale and early access to lightning deals -- sales of certain items "while supplies last."
Ding Zilin and her husband Jiang Peikun in an undated photo. Professor Jiang Peikun has died in the midst of unresolved grief and regret. He and his wife, Ding Zilin, shared a common cause. Their goal was both concrete and audacious: they wanted the truth about the wrongs done to their son, high school student Jiang Jielian, and to countless other victims [on June 4, 1989]. They fought for the rights of those who died [in the military crackdown on the Tiananmen student-led democracy protests] and they fought justice.

Last week General Motors and Ford announced handsome rewards for their executives' 1983 performance. Roger Smith, chairman of GM, picked up $1.49 million in salary, bonus, and stock. Philip Caldwell, Ford's chairman, was awarded a total of $1.42 million. The numbers sound dizzyingly high and may give ammunition to the auto workers in their coming contract renegotiations. Expect more such sensations as announcements about executive compensation start rolling in from other industries. ''Bonuses are expected to be exceptionally large,'' says Daniel Glasner, a senior consultant at the Hay Group , a consulting firm which also specializes in compensation management.
You may have already seen Harley as a person that you thought you had met and known for a long time. So we always reserve the right to sort of do that as well. Call me crazy, but I wonder if it might just be the blonde female character that is 1) crazy, 2) already hung around with Gotham's proto-Joker Jerome, and 3) has no narrative purpose on the show other than wandering around and being emblematic of the show's utter unwillingness to give the tiniest crap to setting up an even barely recognisable Batman universe. I'm not complaining.

In 2012, thousands watched as the hologram of a shirtless Tupac performed "2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted" live alongside Snoop Dogg at Coachella. To the dismay of many, this wasn’t the game-changing musical experience we thought it could be, and similar holograms of Eazy-E and Michael Jackson only firmed our desire to let the dead rest in peace. Videos of the events exploded on YouTube, but their popularity only brought more of the “uncomfortable” novelty to existing ticket holders, rather than broadening the audience or offering new options.
HOUSTON - March 14, 2019 - PRLog -- Schools across America have been working hard to increase safety in the event of an active shooter for several years. On March 13, 2019, the Texas Senate announced $100 million in new funding for improving the security of our schools. According to the Texas School Safety Center, "Time barriers or measures taken beforehand to 'harden the structure' can be an invaluable asset to safety." Furthermore, the Center continued by saying, "the most powerful time barrier in an active assailant event is a locked classroom door."
The two-story store is one of 11 new shops heading to the Somerset Collection in Troy. Eleven new stores are coming to Somerset Collection in Troy, including the state's first Zara, a fashion fan favorite, which is to open in mid-October at Somerset Collection North. It's going to be a big store. At 30,882 square feet, it will cover two stories. Location: adjacent to Macy's on the first and second levels of the mall. It will carry apparel for women, men and kids, plus accessories. The fast fashion brand is headquartered in Spain.
Rap is beautiful, fluid, and powerful. It can move grown men to tears and transform suburbanites into hardened drug dealers for a few minutes at a time. Rap is poetry on HGH. And, when done properly, a rapper&apos;s silver tongue can rival any Shakespearean (or Petrarchan) sonnet. Plus, they have autotune, which puts Willy Shakes at a disadvantage. Occasionally, it is the opposite. Whether it&apos;s a semantics issue that distorts the meaning, an accidental factual inaccuracy or just flat-out inanity, rap has its fair share of blunders.
These actresses are separated by 21 years. But at 45, Carrie-Anne Moss was so dazzling in her one-shouldered white frock at Saturday night's premiere of The Boy Who Smells Like Fish that she upstaged 24-year-old Zoe Kravitz. With little make-up and a distracting septum piercing, the X-Men: First Class starlet looked sweaty and unkempt as she munched popcorn during the cast Q&A at the 30th Miami International Film Festival. The daughter of Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet flaunted her toned stomach in a black crop-top and matching high-waisted skirt as she posed alongside her co-star, Big Love actor Douglas Smith.
BEEVILLE, Texas — Blinn College women’s basketball (10-15, 3-10) fell to Coastal Bend College, 86-78, in overtime, Wednesday night. Alexus Wykoff led the Buccaneers with a season-high 27 points, while Missy Archie followed with 15. Imani Wimbish-Gay was next with 11 points and Alexus Brigham scored 10.

In the third quarter, the momentum shifted in Coastal Bend’s favor.
The seventh-seeded Red Wings upset the second-seeded Anaheim Ducks in the first round of the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs. In a season that almost didnât happen because of a lengthy lockout, the Detroit Red Wings make significant news on and off the ice in 2013. They keep their playoff-appearance streak intact, then stick around longer than most experts expected. During the offseason, they tweak the roster, move to a new conference and make strides toward moving into a new building. The Red Wings qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs for a 22nd consecutive season.
(BBC)- A court in Argentina has sentenced a man to life imprisonment for the brutal murder of high-profile transgender activist Diana Sacayán. She was stabbed 13 times in her Buenos Aires flat in October 2015. Gabriel David Marino, 25, has become the first person in Argentina to be sentenced under new legislation on crimes against transgender people. Human rights groups say Latin America accounts for the greatest number of transgender murders worldwide. Central and South America accounted for 74 percent of the 2,016 murders of transgender and gender-diverse people reported worldwide between January 2008 and December 2015, according to activist group Transgender Europe.
PORTSMOUTH — Several Internal Revenue Service Taxpayer Assistance Centers in New Hampshire are opening their doors on Saturday, Jan. 29 and Feb. 5, for taxpayers eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit. The expanded service is to help taxpayers who may not be able to seek assistance during the work week. EITC is a financial boost for working people hit by hard economic times. Many people will qualify for the first time this year because their incomes declined, their marital status changed or they added children to their families. Bigger families with three or more children get an extra boost with a larger credit this year.
Needless to say, I am not talking about the Miami Heat. I am referring to my home of the past three years, the wonderfully indescribable College of William and Mary. This summer, I have the distinct privilege of serving as a Senior Admission Interviewer (and being able to blog on a site that has the ability to spell check and not let the world know that I have troubles spelling privilege). To say that I am excited would be like saying that the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air wasn’t the best show of the early ’90s… a gross understatement.
A custody dispute may have been the motive for the fatal shooting last week of a 30-year-old Schuyler County man. Daniel Bennett was shot and killed late April 19 at his Pearl Street home in Dix. His young daughter’s mother, Alice Trappler, 39, of Addison; the woman’s late ex-husband, Thomas Borden, 32, of Corning; and Borden’s stepbrother, Nathan Hand, 25, of Corning, were all involved in the killing, police allege. Trappler and Hand are in custody and charged with murder.
The United States produced a bumper crop of what Billie Holiday would call “Strange Fruit,” in March: at least 111 bodies, the majority of them unarmed men of color, shot down by police in the blood-fertilized streets of American cities. If one just counts the unarmed victims, that’s a rate of about two extrajudicial executions per day, roughly twice the “one every 28 hours” cited by the Malcolm X Grassroots Network’s 2012 report, Operation Ghetto Storm. Given the odds against prosecution, officer Michael T. Slager probably counts himself the unluckiest white man in South Carolina.
With the Denver Public Schools pension plan close to going bust in 2007, then-superintendent Michael Bennet championed a risky loan to shield classrooms from budget cuts. At the time, we acknowledged the risk but thought it was a necessary move. But a New York Times piece Friday concluded that the exotic loan finally inked in the spring of 2008 to fully fund the pension quickly “went awry” in the global economic meltdown later that year. With the primary election just days away, the negative attention focused on DPS, and Bennet, couldn’t come at a worse time for the Colorado senator.
Hotel, that currently houses new immigrants, is adjacent to the American consulate in the capital. The American Embassy in Israel, that has consulates in both Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, purchased the Diplomat hotel in the capital. The consulate's Jerusalem offices are split between the Consul's house on Agron street in the center of the city, and the consulate on Flusser Street. The embassy holds the option of purchasing land in the Arnona neighborhood, where the consulate is located. This land includes the Diplomat hotel that currently serves the Ministry of Immigrant Absorption.
Kyle Orton tries toscore from the Titans’1. Denver waspenalized for anillegal formation,erasing the play. It took only one offensive play in Sunday’s 26-20 victory at Tennessee to realize that the Broncos’ running game was, once again, in big trouble. Laurence Maroney took the first handoff of the Broncos’ first offensive series and promptly was tackled for a 4-yard loss. It was the first of 10 rushes that went for either negative yards or no gain on the day for Maroney and fellow running back Correll Buckhalter — seven for Maroney and three for Buckhalter.
Nyon (Switzerland): Manchester United will play Danish side FC Midtjylland after dropping into the Europa League. Louis van Gaal's men, eliminated from the Champions League last week, were handed the tie in the draw for the Last 32 of the second-tier competition at UEFA headquarters in Nyon. Premier League rivals Liverpool will face German outfit Augsburg while Tottenham were paired with Italians Fiorentina. Gary Neville's Valencia were drawn against Rapid Vienna. The first legs of the ties are set to be played on February 18 or 25 with the return matches on March 10 or 17.
As the climate talks in Paris draw to a close, climate activists have taken note: Soil restoration is our ally in the fight against global warming. It is inexpensive (or even profitable), effective and easy to implement, and it yields multiple benefits. Besides capturing carbon and reversing desertification caused by severe drought, soil restoration enhances regional cooling, strengthens resilience against droughts and floods, and improves food quality. It is a necessary second front in our battle against the heating up of Earth’s atmosphere. How so? Soil holds carbon -- lots of it.
Many people read the London based Independent newspaper because among its reporters is the outstanding Robert Fisk. The anti-war stance of the newspaper on Iraq and its stance on genetically manipulated foods and other environmental issues may give the impression that the Independent is a responsible newspaper across the board. But a look at its coverage of Venezuela reveals the same old story of distortion, omission and deceit on US intervention in Latin America that one finds everywhere else in the corporate media. It may be worth pointing out that the owner of the UK Independent is Tony O'Reilly, one of Ireland's most prominent businessmen, formerly head of H.J.
Civil servants went on a £1billion spending spree in just eight weeks to hit the Government’s target of spending 0.7 per cent of the nation’s income on overseas aid. The extra cash was spent at the end of 2013 on humanitarian programmes in Syria and the Philippines and a fund which was started by billionaire Bill Gates to help victims of Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria. MPs said the fact that the taxpayer funds were spent so quickly raised serious questions about whether value for money was achieved. Civil servants are now set to be called in front of an influential committee of MPs to justify the spending.
By , DODOMA, August 9 – The African Union will suspend Mauritania from the bloc following this week’s coup in the west African nation, AU president Tanzania said Saturday. "The AU will suspend Mauritania’s membership until the country returns to constitutional government," said Tanzanian Foreign Minister Bernard Membe, whose country holds the pan-African bloc’s rotating presidency. On Wednesday the former head of Mauritania’s presidential guard, General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, led a coup against Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, after the president tried to make changes in the military leadership.
Activists say they will begin the process of booting anti-labor Republican Scott Walker. But the governor and his allies are putting pressure on the board that oversees elections. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is going to face a recall election next year. More than 200,000 Wisconsinites have pledged to join the effort to remove the radically anti-labor governor and pro-recall groups have announced plans to begin circulating the petitions November 15. Even the governor’s aides admit that it is all but certain that the groups will collect far more than the 540,000 signatures that are required to force the governor to face a new election next spring.
INTER MILAN boss Roberto Mancini has once again been effusive in his praise for Mario Balotelli, prompting speculation he will submit a bid soon. The former Manchester City manager has compared the Italian striker with Paris Saint-Germain legend Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Mancini said: "Mario would like to emulate Ibrahimovic. "But Zlatan has a few more years and has accumulated a degree of experience, quality, class and strength that he [Balotelli] is yet to acquire, even though he's been playing for many years. "Balotelli has that potential and no doubt they were extraordinary together back in the day.

A mum who lost her daughter when she was tragically killed by a lorry as she walked home from school has welcomed a new scheme banning parents from driving and parking in streets around schools . Launched by Solihull Council, the pilot scheme will see motorists fined if they drive around three schools in the area. Nazan Fennell, whose daughter Hope died after being hit by an 18 tonne lorry as she crossed Kings Heath High Street in November 2011, has spoken out to praise the move. The accident happened less than a mile from where the 13-year-old studied at Queensbridge School, reports the Birmingham Mail.
In a business industry as liberal as legal cannabis, today’s political climate may scare off anyone looking to be a part of this nascent market. No need to fear, however, as the upcoming International Cannabis Business Conference intends to provide business people with all the acumen needed to not only survive, but also achieve success during the Trump administration. While Trump himself has vocally supported states’ rights on the issue of marijuana legalization, his Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions has a passionate history of opposing marijuana, even going so far as to recommend mandatory death sentences for a second conviction of selling pot.

OTTAWA — Discount Car & Truck Rentals Ltd. is paying a $700,000 penalty after reaching an agreement with the Competition Bureau over misleading advertising about its prices. Following an investigation, the federal agency found that Discount advertised rental prices that were unattainable due to mandatory fees that were added during the purchasing process. It also determined that advertised rebates suggesting consumers would get a discount on their total bill were not applied to mandatory fees. In addition, various fees described as mandatory government taxes or surcharges were in fact imposed by the company to recover costs.
If you want to cut poverty in the U.S., one big way is strengthen unions. “Of course, the best anti-poverty program is the availability of good jobs. That’s why the president is calling for major investments in technology, manufacturing and education. That’s why he wants to upgrade our infrastructure to create opportunities for good middle-class work” as GOP President Eisenhower did in highways in the 1950s. “We also need skilled, trained workers to fill those jobs…We are making unprecedented investments, working with partners like our community colleges, to build a workforce development system that is aligned with the needs of employers.
Stanislav Yezhov is pictured at start of his hearing on suspicion of being a Russian spy at the courthouse in Kiev on Dec. 22, 2017.

"No, you keep it," I told students, as they tried to hand me their papers at the end of class. "Why did I do it if you're not even going to collect it? What kind of teacher are you?" students replied, before balling up their papers and throwing them on the floor. Did I appreciate students responding like this? No, but I did appreciate why they responded like this. It was early in the year, and they'd been conditioned for years to see it as a teacher's duty to collect every assignment.
CENTRE-BACK Gavin Podmore went between the sticks to help leaders Worcester Raiders claim a 0-0 draw at third-placed Sikh Hunters in West Midlands League Division One. In a game of few chances the hosts struck the bar when Raiders goalkeeper Lewis Pinches was down injured following a blow to his ribs. Having already made three substitutions Podmore agreed to take the gloves for the final 10 minutes. Despite being a man down Raiders held firm and almost snatched victory late on when Roland Krol saw his shot saved after being teed up by Ryan Rowe who has joined from Bewdley Town.
Releasing their poll manifestos on the same day, arch rivals DMK and AIADMK were on the "same page" on Tuesday when they promised to exert pressure on the next government to release seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case and abolish NEET examinations for admissions into medical colleges.

Save for comments by Dolphins wide receiver Mike Wallace, nearly all of the reaction to Jason Collins‘ announcement that he is gay has been positive from fellow athletes. However, despite saying he doesn’t want teammates to have to hide who they are, former Steelers receiver and NBC analyst Hines Ward says the NFL may not be prepared to welcome a homosexual player. “I don’t think football is ready, there’s too many guys in the locker room and, you know, guys play around too much,” Ward said to NBC Sports Radio on Tuesday.
A state lawmaker wants to punish anyone — perhaps even teachers — for disrupting scheduled school days. Danielle Wilson, a music teacher from Gilbert, reacts while a speaker hypes up the crowd on June 23, 2018, during a RedforEd rally outside of the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix. A state lawmaker wants to forbid unexpected school closures through legislation she is proposing less than a year after a teacher-led #RedForEd movement caused hundreds of schools in the state to close during a six-day walkout. Rep. Kelly Townsend, a Republican from Mesa, filed three school-related bills on Friday ahead of next month's opening of the state legislative session.

Luton boss Nathan Jones has urged his side to put another stunning month together as they looked to cement their place in the League One promotion race during December. The Hatters claimed 10 points from a possible 12 in November, following up a haul of 15 from 18 in October, which has seen the Town chief nominated in the manager of the month award on both occasions. Luton have a potential 15 point up for grabs before the new year commences, with home games against Fleetwood and Burton Albion, plus trips to Coventry, Scunthorpe and Walsall, as Jones said: “We want a good month again.
RALEIGH, N.C. — Eighth-grader Hannah Edwards often brings her lunch from home because she’s not a fan of the cafeteria food at East Cary, N.C., Middle School. But she’s happy to supplement her meal with a snack from school; she bought dessert and chips recently. “We don’t really buy school food because it’s disgusting, but the snack food is good,” Hannah said. Starting next year, though, new federal nutrition standards aim to make school snacks healthier. But history shows that when the food becomes healthier, kids buy less.

I delighted you decided to boost not-based-in-the-UK businesses with these proposals. You see, those proposals are so full of holes they will never properly work and will keep you in court for years to come, but you will have scared so many people that they will seek protection from this lunacy. The problem: you effectively ban this sort of protection in the UK, thus handing a solid chunk of business to the exact foreigners you tried to ditch with Brexit. Well done. From all those damn foreigners, a well felt Thank You. Will the last sane person leaving Whitehall please switch off the lights?

The hopeful-bride-to be decided to think ahead after an online quiz told her she would be getting married this year and let her friends know about her big day, although they soon found out her man hadn't actually popped the question. There were a mixture of online responses to the ladies' actions, and some people reasoned she was being practical. One wrote: "We started planning our wedding about six months before we got engaged, not everyone takes a linear path."

RENTON, Wash. – Richard Sherman said Wednesday he never asked for a trade from the Seattle Seahawks, but understood why the only team he’s played for was listening to offers for his services. In his first news conference since the end of last season, Sherman addressed a variety of issues, from the trade rumors that hung over Seattle’s offseason to a report that indicated he was at the center of locker room discontent stemming from the Super Bowl loss to New England, to his conduct during parts of a tumultuous 2016 season.

Can you use junk to keep your home decor fresh? (ARA) - As colder weather arrives, you are probably looking to freshen up your home decor. While it might be counterintuitive, a great way to do this is by using items you might not otherwise have a need for - or to put it bluntly, junk. You may have already heard about a growing trend called "junking," which involves incorporating junk in your home decor. This allows for imaginative self-expression, endless possibilities for original design, and the ability to make your interiors stylishly green.
HOUSTON (CN) – A Texas death-row inmate who believes chanting prayers with his Buddhist priest as he is executed will help him be reborn in the “Pure Land” has asked the Fifth Circuit for a stay because Texas will not let the priest accompany him in the execution room. Patrick Henry Murphy, Jr., 57, was serving a 50-year sentence for aggravated sexual assault in December 2000, when he and six other inmates escaped from a prison in Kenedy, Texas. Now known as the “Texas Seven,” some of the men held up a sporting goods store in Irving, Texas on Dec. 24, 2000.

A group of Prince Albert pickleball players take to the Midtown Community Club Courts on Thursday. -- Jason Kerr/Daily Herald. In the past, Mary Ruth Amundson and her husband have travelled as far away as Arizona for a good pickleball game. That’s not due to a lack of talented players in Prince Albert either. Instead, limited court space in the city meant the Amundsons had to look elsewhere to get their sporting fix. Thankfully, that’s all going to change. On Thursday, the City of Prince Albert officially unveiled the restored and reconfigured outdoor court facilities at the Midtown Community Club.
What can we conclude from the utter and total failure of the Russiagate “investigation” to find any evidence of “Russian collusion”? We can conclude that Hillary’s DNC was partner to this crime and that people like Jarrold Nadler and Adam Schiff have destroyed the reputation and credibility of the Democratic Party. What will be the consequences of this failed act of high treason on the part of the Democratic Party, military/security complex, and presstitute media to falsely convict the duly elected President of the United States and remove him from office?
The Western Province Badminton Association (WPBA) has sought legal advice in dealing with the suspension imposed on them by the Sri Lanka Badminton Association (SLBA). WPBA President L.R Ariyananda told The Island that the WPBA was in the process of replying a letter sent to them by the SLBA which includes five charges against them. In one of the charges, the SLBA has found fault with the WPBA President Ariyananda for bringing badminton to disrepute when airing views during interviews with the media. Another charge against the WPBA is not postponing a tournament which the WPBA hosted despite instructions from the SLBA to postpone it.
MELBOURNE, Australia � Victoria Azarenka overcame a sore left ankle, some anxiety and a slew of frustrating forehand errors before fending off American teenager Sloane Stephens to reach the Australian Open final against Li Na. For the second time in two days, 19-year-old Stephens sat patiently on a courtside chair during a medical timeout by an experienced, older player late in the second set. On Thursday, the top-seeded Azarenka returned to finish off a 6-1, 6-4 win on her sixth match point. It had been a different outcome Wednesday, when Stephens rallied from a set and a break down to beat an injured Serena Williams in three sets.
Following Sunday night's shooting death of yet another member of their community, residents of Salt Spring in St James are again begging for the resumption of the state of public emergency (SOE), which they believe is the only tool capable of creating a buffer between them and marauding gunmen.

"We need the soldiers and police back inna di community. Dem nuh see gunman a shoot we down like birds?"

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch)- Americans who collect Social Security are expected to received a 2.8% increase in their monthly payouts in 2019, based on an unofficial look at how cost-of-living adjustments are calculated. That would mark the biggest increase in seven years. An official announcement should come soon. The extra benefits kick in on Jan. 1. Annual increases in Social Security are determined every year based on changes in a component of the consumer price index known as CPI-W. The final CPI report on which the calculations are made was released Thursday. Social Security recipients got a 2% cost-of-living adjustment in 2018 and 0.3% in 2017.
As more and more Internet-connected devices find their way into our homes and businesses, it’s important to remember that they represent a security risk. The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing rapidly, and in the rush for convenience, our privacy and safety is often an afterthought. Leaving them unsecured is the digital equivalent of leaving the back door unlocked. There are 5.5 million new things getting connected every day in 2016, as we head toward more than 20 billion by 2020, according to Gartner. That’s an awful lot of devices.
The company is raising prices for its grandfathered customers. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) really does not want its customers receiving unlimited data. The company already stopped selling the service to new subscribers way back in 2011. When it made that move, the company did allow existing subscribers to keep their plans, but it has been slowly turning the screws on these users to make them switch to one of the brand's tiered data plans. Verizon has even announced plans to completely eliminate unlimited data in the past, but it has never actually enacted one.
Kyler Jones, 9, smiles as he takes his gavel after being elected Senate president by fellow third-graders during a mock senate session at Windridge Elementary School in Kaysville on Tuesday, April 16, 2019. KAYSVILLE — At Windridge Elementary School, every third-grader was a senator on Tuesday. With Utah Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, to guide them, 80 students learned the finer points of the legislative process. "Who wants to be a legislator? Anybody?" Adams asked. "Today, you're all going to be a legislator. How about that?
Isak Heartstone the troll has done exactly what trolls do: he has raised fear and anxiety, caused conflict between neighbors, incited peaceful warriors to a fury of rage, instigated name-calling and blame, emboldened harsh words and recrimination, and worse. Throughout their mythology, trolls are not kindly toward humans. They threaten us injury and insult, maybe even eat us. Communities of lore with a troll in their midst banish them, like Billy Goat Gruff triumphing over the troll under the bridge by head-butting him into the swift flowing river.
Welcome to the Chrome channel. Google's operating system started off in December 2010 as being little more than all Chrome, all the time. Updates made since then have given Chrome OS users better file format support, faster navigation, revised menus, dramatically improved offline abilities, and a traditional-looking desktop. But if you loathe the Chrome browser, it's still highly unlikely that you'll enjoy this operating system. On the other hand, if you love Chrome, then Chrome OS is a big heaping helping of Chrome with some extra Chrome on the side and more Chrome for dessert.
too grand to be comfortable. The prob- lem of accommodating fire tools fas- cinates this place; there are things like brass jamb hooks to screw into one side of fireplace or mantel (best in Early New England setting; from $2) or steel fire-tool rests, nice for informal hearths; $13 a pair. Baroque andirons are Edwin Jackson's reply to all this interest in the rococo. They are shell- shaped, in baked-on white enamel; $44 a pair. He takes care of the objects-in- miniature vogue with some tiny Vic- torian andirons, delicate but meant for real use.
North Korea is the prime suspect in a hack of South Korea's cyber command that resulted in the theft of confidential military documents, Yonhap News Agency reported. "It seems the intranet server of the cyber command has been contaminated with malware," an official at the Ministry of National Defense told Yonhap. "We found that some military documents, including confidential information, have been hacked." South Korea's cyber command said it later isolated the server from the rest of the network, but it hasn't yet determined how much data was stolen.
President-elect Barack Obama intends to nominate Julius Genachowski, an adviser on technology issues and a longtime friend, to become the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, The New York Times’s Stephen Labaton reported, citing advisers to Mr. Obama. Mr. Genachowski, 46, played a leading role in the Obama campaign’s highly successful online strategy and was a major fundraiser for the campaign. He and Mr. Obama both attended Columbia, though they were in different classes. They became friendly at Harvard Law School, where they both served in top positions at the Harvard Law Review .
TRENTON — A nonpartisan state agency predicts that the state budget will fall short by $668 million before the end of the fiscal year. The Office of Legislative Services offered the dour prediction in its regular report to the Assembly Budget Committee. That predication includes a $329 million decrease in the energy tax receipts that were expected to be allocated to the state budget. Such a drop off in expected tax collections would exceed the state’s surplus of just less than $600 million and force the state to make cuts or borrow from funds outside the state’s $30 billion budget.
Bill and Diana Ellis's loan of their home for use in a movie swiftly turned into "The People vs. `The People vs. Larry Flynt.' "
In early 1996, Columbia Pictures transformed the Ellis residence into the home of the Hustler magazine publisher. It wasn't a big leap: Flynt lived in their Tuscan-style villa in the Bel-Air section of Los Angeles from 1979 until 1986. Ellis, a retired businessman, talked his reluctant wife into allowing the filming. "I thought it would be fun," he says.
Australian music has a new home. The legendary KEXP radio DJ Cheryl Waters, a Seattle stalwart, shares her current local favourites. This year for Songs Of Your Streets, which airs on Monday night as part of Ausmusic Month, Brisbane's Bernard Fanning had an intimate chat to Double J's Jacinta Parsons.

MUMBAI: ‘No blah blah‘ seems to be the mantra of the soon-to-be launched music channel 9XM from INX Media. The channel which has its core TG between 16-20 years dawns a very unconventional look. Instead of resorting to the VJs, the channel has created its own animated characters who will read and speak out the mind of these college going students who form the TG. The three animated characters Bheegi Billi, Bade Chote and Beetels have one thing in common: they hate their teachers.They will crack jokes throughout and personify various attitudes of the youth.
Comedian Jon Stewart headed back to Capitol Hill Thursday to blast Congress' "stupid and embarrassing" failure to renew the Zadroga Act. The former "Daily Show" host, first responders, and Congressional reps made a last ditch push to get the healthcare bill for Sept. 11 responders passed by the end of the year. "This is insane," Stewart told the crowd. "We have a bunch of first responders outside freezing their asses off," he said. "Our country's last responders, our country's worst responders, are inside nice and comfy and cozy, and probably having soup."

Are you sick of the stress of modern life? Do you dream about getting off the grid, escaping to a remote island paradise with a close friend or partner? Well this could be the job for you. Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service is looking for two volunteer caretakers to live on remote Maatsuyker Island about 10 kilometres off the state's south-west coast for six months. "It's a really, really important habitat for short-tailed shearwaters and also for breeding marine mammals like New Zealand and Australian fur seals and elephant seals", Ranger Jeremy Hood said.
In a blender or food processor (Vitamix works best), blend kale, garlic, and walnuts. While the machine is running, slowly add olive oil until desired consistency.

Today, I called Polish Prime Minister Tusk to express Michelle&apos;s and my deepest condolences to the people of Poland on the tragic deaths this morning of President Lech Kaczynski, First Lady Maria Kaczynski, and all who were traveling with them to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Kaczynski family, the loved ones of those killed in this tragic plane crash, and the Polish nation. Today’s loss is devastating to Poland, to the United States, and to the world.

Will Foxglove Kill My Cats? Foxglove blooms best in cool weather. Foxgloves (Digitalis purpurea) add a splash of color to shady woodland gardens within U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 3 to 9 with their speckled, bell-shaped flowers. Their widespread presence in gardens lends them a harmless reputation, although foxgloves are actually highly toxic to humans and animals alike. Cats that ingest foxgloves can easily be killed if not promptly treated by a veterinarian, so it is best to limit contact between the plants and any curious four-legged foragers. Foxgloves have a distinctive appearance that makes them easily distinguishable from harmless annuals.
You don't need a thesaurus to tell that Bill Maur is obviously one of Naples elite and prosperous business owners who benefits big time by President Donald Trump's tax cuts for the rich. So eager to benefit in any way from the dictates of Trump, he quickly jumps on his bandwagon to criticize our Justice Department and the FBI instead of seeing who the real culprit is. I do resent his implication in referring to me as a "flaming liberal." I'm actually an 82-year-old mature woman who always has been an independent who leans more conservative than liberal.
AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Jared Harper scored 16 points while Chuma Okeke and Bryce Brown each had 14 to help Auburn snap a three-game losing streak with a 92-58 rout of Missouri Wednesday night.

Officers were informed one male had allegedly abducted another male and that he was torturing said male in a hunting shack at an unknown location in the rural area over an unpaid drug debt. Emerson RCMP alerted the RCMP Detachments in Morden, Carman, and Manitou and extensive large-scale search were initiated jointly by the four Detachments. Specialized police units from Winnipeg (including the RCMP Major Crimes Unit) were called to assist as well. Later that day, the male suspect was tracked down in the La Riviere area.
All military personnel in each country will continue to receive their same salaries, but all war fighting, planning, and spending (except for salaries) will come to a complete stop permanently on January 1, 2020. Moreover, let us plan to dismantle all nuclear weapons and study war no more. Nations that agree may sign below. Which country will be the first to sign? And which will be the last? Brave and model countries that sign may cancel if not many other countries join by January 1, 2020, or they may courageously continue as they are led.
Sounding like the presidential candidate he insists he is not, Gov. Andrew Cuomo unleashed an energetic attack against President Donald Trump's policies Tuesday, pledging New York will lead the nation forward with the most progressive agenda in state history. The Democrat began 2019 and his third term with the inaugural address on Ellis Island, saying "America's only threat is from within." Cuomo said that within the first 100 days of his new term, he will propose "the most progressive agenda this state has ever seen, period."
"Ponderosa" lemons are a cross between lemons and citrons. "Ponderosa" lemon (Citrus x limon "Ponderosa") is believed to be a cross between a lemon (Citrus limon) and a citron (Citrus medica). "Ponderosa" lemons are yellow, like lemons, but have rough, thick peels like citrons, both of which grow in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 9 through 10. Often grown as an ornamental citrus, the fruit of the "Ponderosa" lemon tree can grow as large as grapefruit, and the tree produces attractive, purple and white flowers year-round.
The tension between the freedom of the press and the government’s and military’s need to operate with privacy to hash out policy and with secrecy in matters of national security has always created a complicated dance. The WikiLeaks publication of 91,000 classified documents concerning the war in Afghanistan, some as recent as December 2009, blows that dance apart. The tension between the freedom of the press and the government’s and military’s need to operate with privacy to hash out policy and with secrecy in matters of national security has always created a complicated dance.
Bendigo golfer Andrew Martin has wrapped up a week on the golf course in Thailand at the Queen’s Cup hosted by the Jaidee Foundation. Martin scored rounds of 71, 68, 68 and 70 (277) to finish the tournament T48 at three-under par. Martin has one more event to play for the year where he must excel to secure a spot on the Asian Tour for the 2019 season. Currently in 64th position after 14 events on the Habitat for Humanity standings, his goal is to finish in the top 60 to ensure he will be able to continue on the tour.
NEW YORK CITY — Lower Manhattan was quiet Saturday morning, resonating only with the solemn sounds of the Sept. 11 anniversary ceremony. But by the afternoon, the streets near Ground Zero had turned into a highly policed battleground, with multiple groups dueling it out through opposing demonstrations. One of the largest rallies, organized by the New York City Coalition to Stop Islamophobia, was staged near City Hall Park and drew both Muslims and non-Muslims in support of the Cordoba House Islamic center and mosque, often referred to simply as the Ground Zero mosque.
AKRON, Ohio — He’s trending. And evolving. And still learning. And he’s still playing, which is perhaps the best development of all. What began as a potential season on the brink for Tiger Woods has become one of happy discovery and surprising success, reflected in his return to Firestone Country Club for this week’s WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. Woods had to climb into the top 50 in the world to qualify for an event he has won a record eight times, a tall order after starting the year 656th and not competing for much of the previous two years because of a back injury.
As keepers and dispensers of business wisdom, people often ask us to explain certain mysterious aspects of the world of finance to them that they cannot explain to themselves. Since we think on a higher plane about this stuff than most, it&apos;s generally helpful to use a pop culture analogy to elucidate. Don&apos;t think of this as us dumbing down the material for your benefit, but merely-actually, that&apos;s exactly what it is. But what I&apos;m saying is, don&apos;t feel bad about it.
There was plenty of action-packed drama in this BBC SSO concert which started in the splendour of Vienna’s ballrooms and finished with a grotesque funeral. Taking the initial pulse of the double basses and bassoons, the orchestra and conductor Yan Pascal Tortelier breathed life into Ravel’s La Valse. They captured the sumptuousness of the waltz in all its guises; from the romantic swirls of strings and harps to a more militaristic brass-powered form. But it was the subtle dance between the orchestra and soloist Steven Osborne in Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 4 in G major that most beguiled.
The 12.3-mile extension of the Gold Line will run through six cities. The project that will extend the Foothill Gold Line from Glendora to Montclair has reached its first milestone – to relocate utilities along the future route – ahead of schedule. The 12.3-mile extension is currently estimated to cost $1.5 billion and has been funded on the Los Angeles County side by Measure M sales tax dollars, approved by voters in November 2016. For the past 11 months, crews worked to relocate a dozen water and sewer lines that cross the railroad corridor, Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction Authority CEO Habib F. Balian said in a news release.
Mumia before and after diabetes crisis. Political Prisoner and journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal has been subjected to over three decades of torture from the US prison gulag. His political imprisonment has placed his life in serious danger, this time not from state execution but instead from extra-legal medical neglect. The prison state has continuously failed in its efforts to murder Mumia through official means and has thus decided to refuse the former Black Panther adequate medical treatment for diabetes. Meanwhile, Boston residents of all classes await the verdict of whether the alleged “Boston bomber” Dzokhar Tsarnaev will receive the death penalty or life in prison.
Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have joined a record-setting cohort of independents and MPs from 'unrecognized' parties. If a group of crows is called a 'murder', an assembly of ferrets is a 'business' and a collection of owls is a 'parliament', what do you call a row of independent MPs? A 'schism' of independents? A 'motley', perhaps? How about an 'insurrection'? With the ejection of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus this week, the number of independent MPs in the House of Commons has exploded.
About three weeks ago, my sister popped an intervention on me. "Your clothes say 'cool'," she explained with an inhale, "but your hair says 'sister wife'." It was time, I learned, for the absolute loathsome task of going to get a haircut. I'm just one of those laid-back people who doesn't really care too much about my hair. It grows fast, I know that much, and it's curly, unless I straighten it. It's in a top-knot if it's not down.
Monterey >> With the arrival of spring comes the arrival of the killer whales to Monterey Bay. An attack last week on a gray whale calf by a group of 17 killer whales signified the beginning of “killer whale season” to many observers. The killer whales (also known as orcas) found in this area patrol long stretches of coastline looking for their prey, which include seals, dolphins, and, when they can get them, gray whale calves. Those gray whale calves are really what drives the seasonal abundance of killer whales, according to Nancy Black, a marine biologist with Monterey Bay Whale Watch.
Following are excerpts from An Imperiled Generation, the report of the trustees of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. We begin with one essential declaration: an urban school will be successful only as teachers, administrators, and community leaders have confidence that all students can succeed. Different approaches to learning are required, but all students, regardless of background, should be given the tools and encouragement they need to be socially and economically empowered. It is unacceptable that, year after year, about one out of every three urban students leaves school before completing the program or receiving a diploma.
The Ritz-Carlton Hotel has signed a management agreement with NDG Asia Pacific to open the first Ritz-Carlton property in New Zealand in 2019, creating a new iconic property that will enhance the famous skyline of New Zealand’s leading waterfront city, Auckland. Located in the downtown heart of the city amid the well-preserved city landmarks, adjacent to the distinctive Sky City, The Ritz-Carlton, Auckland will offer uninterrupted 360 degree views of Auckland’s twin harbours with easy access to nearby vineyards on Waiheke Island beyond by helicopter, as well as allowing guests to hands-on experience the thrills of the America’s Cup on an original racing yacht.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. – Saks Inc. (SKS), which announced last month it is selling off its Proffitt&apos;s and McRae&apos;s department stores, on Tuesday reported a lower-than-expected profit for the first quarter as its mid-price department-store business continues to languish. For the first quarter ended April 30, income was $17.1 million, or 12 cents per share. The latest results include a gain of a penny per share from disposing of closed stores, offset by a penny per share related to expenses from an investigation of alleged improper collections of money from vendors at its Saks Fifth Avenue (search) division.
Researchers reveal that meeting public health guidelines for physical activity alone may not be enough to fend off the adverse effects associated with a sedentary lifestyle for seniors. Instead, new research suggests that fitness, not physical activity alone, plays a protective role in guarding the body against risk factors for heart disease and other conditions. Even when seniors sit for 12-13 hours per day, if they are fit, their cardiovascular risk factors are reduced. Living a sedentary lifestyle - such as sitting for prolonged periods - has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and other conditions.
Former “Sesame Street” writer Mark Saltzman said Bert and Ernie’s relationship was modeled after his own with his life partner, Arnold Glassman. Iconic "Sesame Street" puppets Bert and Ernie are a couple, according to a former writer for the show. In an exclusive interview with with blog "Queerty," Mark Saltzman said he felt that when he was writing Bert and Ernie, he was writing them as a couple and basing their interactions on his own experiences. "I always felt that without a huge agenda, when I was writing Bert and Ernie, they were," Saltzman told Queerty.
A second horse in Colorado has tested positive for Equine Infectious Anemia this year, according to a release from the state Department of Agriculture. Both sick animals are in Weld County, but state officials said the two cases are unrelated. "While the investigation is in its initial stages, it is clear the affected horse is unrelated to horses, locations or movements to the previous case in 2018," State Veterinarian Dr. Keith Roehr said in a news release. "The affected horse and other horses on the second Weld County property are subject to a quarantine, which restricts movement of any horses on or off the property."
Teen suicides often get the most media attention - tragic stories like that of Canadian teen Amanda Todd remind us that depression is a serious mental health issue for adolescents. But a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows more attention needs to be directed at preventing suicide in adults as well. Between 1999 and 2010, suicides in the 35-to-64 age group increased 28.4%, according to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Suicides among people aged 50 to 59 years old specifically almost doubled during that time period.
Supplying laptops to all 2,000-plus high school students in tornado-ravaged Joplin, Missouri is just one example of how the country's donations are helping local communities. In the past two years, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government has been providing financial assistance to needy communities across the US, including building all-weather soccer fields in low-income areas of major cities and providing laptops to every high school student in Joplin, MO, which saw six of its schools destroyed by the 2011 tornado. Besides simply wanting to help, the UAE hopes to create a favorable impression among Americans.
Young men wave national flags during a protest demanding the government release hundreds of protesters held in custody since 2018, in Managua, Nicaragua, March 16, 2019. The government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega is promising to free all protesters arrested in the last year within 90 days. The release of more than 700 opposition protesters had been the main demand of the opposition for continuing talks with the government. In return, the government is asking for the lifting of sanctions imposed against the Ortega administration. The announcement was made Wednesday by the two independent figures who are monitoring and assisting the talks.
In the Windows Phone world this week was a leak of a reported Nokia smartwatch, another leak of the Windows 10 Mobile release date, and that the platform has a drop in US share. A slide that appears to be from Microsoft indicates a September release for Windows 10 Mobile. This fits with Microsoft's statements that it would roll out after the version for PCs. The leak indicates a "late next quarter" release for Windows 10 Mobile which puts it in the September timeframe. Numbers reported by ComScore show that Windows Phone is growing in the EU, India, and Pakistan but dropping in the US.
NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks struggled higher yesterday, lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average within striking distance of 10,000 for the first time since May 2002, as a strong start to earnings season eased worries that the market’s rally has been overly optimistic. Nasdaq stocks pushed to their highest levels in 20 months as investors anxiously awaited a third-quarter profit report from Intel Corp., which topped most analysts’ forecasts after the close of trading. The Dow rose 48.60, or 0.5 percent, to 9,812.98, the first close above 9,800 since May 31, 2002. Broader stock measures also rose.
The Red Sox made it fairly obvious how badly they wanted to add bullpen depth this offseason. Dan Wheeler was someone they thought would help, so they went after the veteran hard — and it paid off. Wheeler was on Red Sox Live on Tuesday, and he spoke about how the Red Sox showed interest in him from the beginning, something that ended up being one of the deciding factors for him to come to Boston. Now, the Rhode Island native says he's ready for a chance to win a World Series, something he thinks the Red Sox are certainly capable of doing.
Homepage Mobile Phones Google Nexus Ringdroid Problems: Can you help? Ringdroid Problems: Can you help? Ok, there is a member of the Android Community who is having a spot of bother with Ringdroid. Apparently it only shows 5 songs out of all the songs she has on her mobile phone. Even though she he adamant she has transferred the songs from her computer to her phone correctly, none of those songs show up, and she’s a bit confused that two songs she obtained from “Tunes for Android” show up on Ringdroid automatically.
The Progressive Labour Party opened its doors to the public for the opening night of its Annual Delegates Conference. Carlton Simmons , president of Youth on the Move, is disappointed that the Premier lifted a line from his charity's 2006 business plan for a political speech without giving credit. He is shown pointing out the sentence as it appeared in the original document. Premier Paula Cox has been criticised by a youth charity for lifting a line from its business plan for a political speech without giving credit. Ms Cox used the sentence from Youth on the Move (YOM) at a Progressive Labour Party rally last week.
The Ohio Elections Commission found today that state Rep. Zack Milkovich�s campaign committee made a false statement in yard signs, failing to make it clear that Milkovich is running for Barberton Clerk of Courts and doesn�t currently hold that office. The commission, however, opted not to refer the matter for prosecution, noting steps the committee has since made to correct the issue, said Phil Richter, the commission�s executive director. "The commission reserves sending to prosecution for the most egregious violations," Richter said. Milkovich�s signs originally said "Zack Milkovich ... Clerk of Court," without a "for" between the two parts.
After years of whittling down the Super Mario 64 120-star speedrun time to under 1 hour and 41 minutes — a feat achieved in August 2015 — the race was on to take another 60 seconds off the clock. Speedrunner Allan “Cheese05" Alvarez managed to set an astounding new world record last night with a time of 1 hour, 39 minutes and 57 seconds, breaking his own world record of 1:40:05 he set in April. He hit the elusive 1:39 time with a jaw-dropping run through the game, utilizing an array of glitches and exploits paired with near-perfect pathing to grab 120 stars with just seconds to spare.

A dispute over possible deployment has brought sharp words between Seoul and Beijing. Foreign ministers of S. Korea, China, and Japan will meet for the first time in three years Saturday amid tensions over security, territory, and wartime history. US interest in placing a new generation of missile defense with a detection range of up to 1,200 miles on the Korean peninsula has brought a diplomatic dust-up between Beijing and Seoul, with China this week asking that the system not be deployed, and South Korea retorting that the decision is its own.
WEST MIFFLIN --�To board the Memphis Belle, duck through its narrow passageways, feel the propellers roar to life and eventually glide into the air is more than just a plane ride. It�s a flight back in time. The original Memphis Belle�s crew was the first B-17 crew to complete 25 missions over Europe during World War II with all of the men returning unharmed. The 70th anniversary of the plane�s historic mission was May 17. The original plane is awaiting restoration, but the nonprofit Liberty Foundation has helped to preserve another B-17 of the era.
The new head of the Boston FBI Field Office sat down with NBC10 Boston to talk about his new role. He's the FBI's new man in charge in Boston: Joseph Bonavolonta, special agent in charge of the Boston field office, sat down with NBC10 Boston Monday to talk about the current threats the bureau is tackling. "What keeps me up at night would simply be, 'What is it we don't know or what we aren't aware of,'" said Bonavolonta. He said the biggest threats are violent crime, gang violence, terrorism and cyber attacks.
A former Norodom Ranariddh Party member was convicted yesterday of illegally possessing a weapon and wearing a military police uniform at the party’s cabinet office in 2007. Nou Kim Y, 49, was found guilty of the two offences at Phnom Penh Municipal court yesterday but was found not guilty of abusing Sao Rany, a NRP lawmaker for Prey Veng province. The court heard that Nou Kim Y had produced a gun without licence and had worn a military uniform during a heated argument about money at the Norodom Ranariddh Party’s office in Phnom Penh in 2007.
Sigi Schmid's job as coach of the Galaxy hung in the balance Friday, despite the new contract he was given in March after leading the team to its first Major League Soccer championship last season. Schmid, 50, met with his players Thursday and told them he was unsure whether he would be retained as coach in the wake of the Galaxy's first-round elimination in this season's playoffs. The decision will be made by Doug Hamilton, the team's vice president and general manager, possibly as early as Monday. Hamilton's own position apparently is secure.

Analyst outfit Gartner has likened the Apple Watch to the invasive Kudzu vine, an Asian plant that has become a pest around the world. Kudzu's survival strategy, says analyst Robert Hetu, relies on its ability to find deep water with carbohydrate-rich roots and a habit of growing vines and leaves in triplicate to give it redundant resources that crowd out competitors. Apple, Hetu says, put down deep roots by tapping consumers' precious music collections. The company then unfurled touch-screens to put other smartphones in the shade. Apps and the iPad represented incremental evolutions that slower-developing species struggled to match.
IAC-backed Aereo is expanding its disruptive pay TV service into 22 new markets, it announced today. Aereo lets you watch free, locally broadcast HDTV channels (from local affiliate stations for ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, CW, and others) on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

Aereo also provides a DVR feature that lets you record up to 40 hours of content.
Wax begonias have rounded leaves that can be green or bronze. 1 How Tall Should a Picket Fence Be? 4 What Are Tall Outside Plants That Grow in the Shade? Shade-tolerant flowering plants that are available in containers at the local garden center can be planted successfully in the middle of the summer. They are already growing in soil in the containers which makes planting them in a new, shady location less stressful. Select plants that grow well in the amount of shade provided in your landscape and keep the soil uniformly moist until winter.
Cloudy skies this morning will become partly cloudy this afternoon. Slight chance of a rain shower. High 62F. Winds NNW at 5 to 10 mph.. It is spring in Oakland. The daffodils are in their full glory and the wild plum are blooming. Some plum trees are blooming from a horizontal position, having been knocked down by our storm. It’s almost like they are determined to celebrate spring in spite of the storm. But much of the debris has been cleaned up and Oakland is open for business. There are some new businesses, some new renovations and old favorites to visit.
In the video, the bus comes to a stop and the vehicle’s stop sign begins to flash. A black car comes to a halt — but a silver car behind it quickly zips over a sidewalk and through a patch of grass before leaving the camera’s view. Young children are heard talking in the video. “Can you get his license plate?” a man is heard asking. “If kids were coming towards the bus from these houses, it could have been tragic,” the school wrote.
See by Chloé‘s fall lineup featured a fresh mix of romantic silhouettes and heritage prints influenced by the English countryside. For fall, the See by Chloé lineup was influenced by English countryside style. Romantic pieces with heritage checks and cozy knits made for a fresh mix for the brand. Knits were a highlight, and came in the form of cozy, long cardigans (most intriguing in half alpaca, half wool blocked on the front and back), mid-length skirts with horizontal athletic stripes or as a poncho with side ties and a turtleneck.
Toward the end of my general surgery training, a senior surgeon pulled me aside to ask about my plans for further training. One of the best surgeons in the hospital, he had done his own subspecialty training at a hospital famous for vascular surgery. He nodded in approval when I told him where I was going; the hospital was known for excellent results with sick patients undergoing difficult operations. Dr. Pauline Chen explores the doctor-patient bond. At the time, I didn’t believe him. I was convinced the hospital had superior results because the surgeons were so good.
Two Palestinians succumbed Monday to wounds sustained during Friday's protests along the Gaza border fence, reports the Gaza Health Ministry. Both died as a result of gunshot wounds, bringing the overall death toll of Palestinians from Israeli army fire to 39. During the early morning hours, 20-year old Abdallah Shamali died from sustaining a severe gunshot wound to the stomach. A few hours later, Tahrir Sayid Wahaba, 18, who was shot in the head, also died. Both were residents of Rafiah. Their deaths raise the Palestinian death toll of Friday's protest to six, and 39 total since protests began a month ago.
In 2003, the city gave promotion exams — prepared by a firm specializing in employment tests, and approved, as federal law requires, by independent experts — to 118 candidates, 27 of them black. None of the blacks did well enough to qualify for the 15 immediately available promotions. After a rabble-rousing minister with close ties to the mayor disrupted meetings and warned of dire political consequences if the city promoted persons from the list generated by the exams, the city said: No one will be promoted. The city called this a “race-neutral” outcome because no group was disadvantaged more than any other.
A girl walks among 3,000 sunflowers planted outside a building in the Ginza shopping district in Tokyo on Sunday. The impression of the sea of yellow sunflowers will be forever imbedded in her subconscious. The little girl makes this photo a keeper. Otherwise it's just a photo of flowers. I learned a long time ago that most photos of just landscape aren't worth keeping, whereas photos with people in them are. I learned a long time ago that most photos of just landscape aren't worth keeping, whereas photos with people in them are. Odd.
A woman was killed as security forces dispersed a march by the Socialist Popular Alliance Party on Saturday in central Cairo. Shaimaa El-Sabag, one of dozens of marchers, was shot by pellets at close range, according to a statement issued by the party. The health ministry has confirmed her death. In a statement, the interior ministry denied that a policeman had gunned her down, saying marchers used fire crackers. "And later," the statement reads, "a woman was injured and hospitalised, but she died after succumbing to her injuries."
Archbishop Michael Jude Byrnes appointed the Very Rev. Msgr. James L.G. Benavente as a member of his two teams of advisors. Archbishop Michael Jude Byrnes appointed Monsignor James L.G. Benavente as a member of two advisory teams, effective July 16 at 6 p.m., according to the Archdiocese of Agana.

Hey, guys. This is Brian Bennett for CNET.com. And right now, we have got our hands on the brand new Blackberry Z30. Now, this device hasn't actually shipped yet but it should be available for the holiday season. It's gonna be shipping probably in a few weeks in the UK and the Middle East. So what's really interesting about the Z30 is that it has a very large 5-inch Super AMOLED at 720p HD resolution screen here and that's a very big screen for a Blackberry. Right now most Android devices support that or have this kind of screen.
The novelist and sometime phil?o?sopher Walker Percy used to say that Angelism-by which he meant the denial of our bodily nature-is the defining heresy of modernity. The great French political theorist Pierre Manent seems to be getting at something similar in his new book, A World Beyond Politics? A Defense of the Nation-State, when he argues that moderns aspire to anchor all bonds and obligations in a purely spiritual decision, freefrom antecedent bodily conditions. Manent sees modernity as a quest for freedom from all sources of obligation extrinsic to the human will.
By Binoy Kampmark - posted Monday, 2 May 2011 Sign Up for free e-mail updates! The corrupt, vanishing body has fascinated and puzzled societies for millennia. Evita Peron's power was more significant to Argentineans after her death than during her life. Saints tend to be more useful in a state of persisting decomposition than one of living composure. Now, it is the Bin Laden phenomenon which appears, yet again, with all its mind numbing force. Facebook and Twitter are overheating with the announcements that America's bug bear has been butchered in his cave, or should we say compound.
SANTA ANA, Calif. — Nadya Suleman — known as “Octomom” — filed bankruptcy papers on Monday here in federal court. Suleman’s debt could be as much as $1 million — 20 times more than her net worth, according to court documents. The mother of 14 has up to $50,000 in assets. Under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a court-appointed trustee will go through and liquidate whatever assets Suleman has that can be used to pay off her creditors. Debtors like Suleman typically receive a discharge from most of their debts in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, according to the federal courts website.

It might be annoying, but occasionally you cannot discuss one film without bringing up another. The history of the medium is relatively short, so influences abound, some more inescapable than others. Such is the case with Violet, the debut feature from Belgian filmmaker Bas Devos, which carries the cinematic DNA of Gus Van Sant's Paranoid Park. That latter film – quiet, enigmatic, haunting – followed the exploits of bored teenage skaters in America skirting the boundaries of adulthood and the violent trauma of adolescence; Violet focuses on bored teenage BMX bikers in Belgium faced with essentially the same existential drama.
Roy Halladay might not be the only former Cy Young award winner the Phillies are interested in bringing in. While officially the Phillies have said they are “just exploring all possibilities” by scouting Pedro Martinez, a team source told ESPN it’s much more serious. And a scout for the team likes what he saw from the 37-year-old. “The decision to sign him depends on the front office, but as far as we are concerned, we saw a Pedro MartÃ­nez ready to help a team,” Phillies scout Robinson Garcia told ESPNdeportes.
He may have been snubbed in the eyes of some when it came to the Heisman Trophy voting, but Saquon Barkley will still be taking home at least one piece of national hardware this awards season. It was announced Wednesday morning that the Penn State running back has become the second straight player from the Big Ten to win the Paul Hornung Award. Michigan’s Jabrill Peppers was the winner of the 2016 award. There were three other finalists for this year’s award — North Carolina State running back Nyheim Hines, Iowa State linebacker/quarterback Joel Lanning and Washington wide receiver Dante Pettis.
I called a company and asked to speak to Bob. The person who answered said, "Bob is on vacation. Would you like to hold?" I worked with an individual who plugged their power strip back into itself and for the life of them could not understand why their computer would not turn on. "Do you know anything about this fax-machine?" "Well, I sent a fax, and the recipient called back to say all she received was a cover-sheet and a blank page. I tried it again, and the same thing happened."
Adam Kearns claims he owned a gun for his own protection against his mother, "Black Widow'' Helen Milner. The son of Christchurch's infamous Black Widow has narrowly avoided jail for possessing a gun he claimed was to protect him from his mother. Adam Kearns, the son of convicted murderer Helen Milner, appeared in Christchurch District Court this afternoon. He earlier pleaded guilty to a representative charge of selling the class A drug cannabis, possession of cannabis, and unlawful possession of a gun. Kearns was surrounded by supporters in the public gallery.
If Peter Clark’s report on Winter Institute was any indication, the bookselling community is hardly feeling complacent in the face of the drastically shifting American political landscape. The same thing can certainly be said of the larger literary community, many of whom will be descending upon—of all places—Washington, DC for the annual Association of Writers & Writing Programs (AWP) conference this week. On Thursday, around 12,000 writers, college and university creative writing programs, literary journals, and independent publishers will gather for three days of presentations, reading, panels, lectures — and political demonstrations.
Comedian Aziz Ansari had a tense encounter with an audience member who had asked, "Why don't you have a red dot on your forehead? The audience immediately gasped, according to Entertainment Weekly. A shocked Ansari came back with a not-so-racist but equally offensive rebuttal. He went on to ask her why she didn’t have the word “c– on her forehead.” Then remarked about how there are still “racist” people in the world.

Thousands of new rental apartments hit the market in the Twin Cities this year, but shoppers still have limited options and are facing the biggest rent increases in nearly a decade. Since January, 5,750 apartments have become available in the metro area, but the average vacancy rate fell slightly to 2.3 percent by the end of October, according to a quarterly report from Marquette Advisors. An influx of upscale, expensive units and a dearth of rental options in some parts of the region caused the average monthly rent price during the third quarter to increase 4.6 percent to $1,053.

An event manager for 25 years, Niranjan and Isha have known each other since her Surya Vamsha and O Nanna Nalle days. But that wasn’t the reason Niranjan wanted to cast Isha in his debut production. “Isha plays an additional commissioner of police in this film.

JAMES McCARTHY is considering his future at Everton after promises about a new contract at Goodison Park reportedly weren't kept. McCarthy has become a crucial part of Roberto Martinez's Toffees' side this season. But the Republic of Ireland international has watched on as several key players have received new contracts, or opened talks about extending their stay, but is yet to be offered one himself. According to the Daily Mail, McCarthy now wants a new deal himself as a point of principle, rather than any concerns over his current level of pay.
The so-called bedroom tax - otherwise known as the under-occupancy charge - is hitting the most vulnerable people in society, according to a councillor in Stroud. It was introduced to try to free up under-occupied properties for families but campaigners say it should be scrapped. The Green party in Stroud says that the bedroom tax is hitting the wrong people. The MP for St Ives wants to change the "bedroom tax". Andrew George says it shouldn't apply those with medical reasons or no alternative. The 'tax' - actually a reduction in housing benefit for families with spare bedrooms - was introduced in April 2013.
Like the Chinese Communists, from whom we borrowed "enhanced interrogation" techniques, we were torturing to extract false confessions. It wasn't about defending America; it was about defending the Iraq War's false premise. American voters renounced that false premise in the last election. Still, it's easy to understand why President Barack Obama might rather close the book on past abuses and keep Congress and the public focused on the enormous problems ahead. The economy is still in shambles, al-Qaida allies appear to be on the verge of taking control of Pakistan and Shia-Sunni tensions are resurgent in Iraq.
Former Chelsea and England midfielder Frank Lampard had an unhappy Major League Football debut on Saturday when his new club New York City FC were beaten 3-2 by the Montreal Impact. The 37-year-old received a rousing ovation from the Yankee Stadium crowd when he came on as a substitute in the 69th minute, with New York FC already 2-1 behind. Montreal went further ahead when Ignacio Piatti scored from the penalty spot in the 84th minute, his second goal of the game, before New York FC managed a consolation through Thomas McNamara one minute later.
IOWA CITY, Iowa – Aaron White scored 20 points as Iowa throttled Coppin State 80-50 on Saturday. The Hawkeyes (11-2) have won six straight games for the first time in eight years. White made 7 of 8 shots from the floor and 6 of 7 from the foul line. The forward had six dunks — including a nice one-hand slam off an alley-oop.

One month after signing the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, the U.S. and New Zealand governments have published the full trade treaty, including details of what ISPs must do to defend others' copyrights. The deal sets out to reshape trade relations between countries including the U.S., Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, and New Zealand. Information and communications technology products are singled out for special attention, as are telecommunications services and Internet service providers. It's not all about technology though: it also covers wine and spirits, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, organic foods and secret recipes for prepackaged foods and food additives.
Wait, what? Who needs an app to remind us to inhale oxygen? Isn’t this as silly as those apps that remind you to drink water when you’re thirsty? I know this from experience. Early in my senior year of college, I experienced my first real bout of anxiety. It struck suddenly—so quickly that I thought I was having a heart attack—and refused to fade. Worst of all, there was no clear cause. It was generalized anxiety, the sort of thing that probably afflicts lots of students about to leave the soft, cushy bubble of campus life for the first time.
Eminent Pakistani humorist and Urdu short-story writer, Shafiq-ur-Rehman, passed away on 19th March 2000. While professionally a military doctor, Shafiq-ur-Rehman is remembered in literary circles as a writer of great poise and wit. His prominent collections include Kirnein (1942), Shagofey (1943) and Himaqatein (1947), and feature autobiographical retellings of his life experiences, including those in the medical and military service. His writing is distinct in its simplicity, humor and palatable philosophical musings, and is considered a staple among young and old readers of Urdu literature.

Sean Maguire admitted scoring a 94th-minute winner as Preston North End saw off Birmingham was a “special moment”. The Irishman popped up to head home Daniel Johnson’s corner to settle a game low on quality and spark wild scenes of celebration at Deepdale. The dramatic 1-0 victory moved the Lilywhites up to seventh with their fine 12-game unbeaten run meaning they only sit outside the play-off places on goal difference. “It was a strange game,” Maguire said. “We knew that there wasn’t going to be much football played.
Bob Dole paid a call to Representative Mike Pompeo, who’s been dropping hints that he plans to challenge Senator Jerry Moran in August’s Republican primary. The battle over a controversial religious-liberty bill in Georgia reveals that the Religious Right isn't as powerful as it once was, even in the deep-red South. Utah senator Orrin Hatch is preparing to help lead the Republican majority in the fight over President Obama’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Donald Trump met with Congressional Republicans for lunch Monday, in what was billed as an effort to win new supporters.
Was Dwayne Bravo of the Stars a success or a disappointment in BBL|08? The Melbourne Stars appeared to be cruising to their first Big Bash League championship against the Melbourne Renegades at 0/93, chasing 146 for victory, needing about a run a ball in the remaining five overs to claim victory. Then disaster struck, panic set in, and before they knew it the dream was over; they had gifted glory to their cross-town rivals, as a bumper crowd in excess of 40,000 cheered the 'Gades home at their Marvel Stadium home ground.

Some women may choose to forego the Valentine's Day indignities this Sunday and instead escape into the mannerly sanctuary of "Downton Abbey." It's not that all those men behave well. Some are monsters in white ties, one having abandoned a bride at the altar. But they dress according to high standards. If they didn't, they'd never have gotten far enough with a lady to play the cad. And do note that the upper-class requirements for formal dress and exquisite tailoring aren't all about putting on the dog. They are also about showing respect for those around them.
6lack&apos;s highly anticipated sophomore album is around the corner. On Wednesday, the Atlanta artist revealed the cover art and release date for East Atlanta Love Letter, the follow-up to his 2016 effort Free 6lack. The art shows 6lack in a makeshift studio with his daughter, Syx Rose Valentine.

The project will also explore universal themes like love and empathy, as demonstrated in the album&apos;s previously released single "Switch."
A Savannah real estate broker claims Gov. Nathan Deal prodded a state panel to dump its top staffer and hire his "political crony." Ben Farmer says Deal got the Georgia Real Estate Commission to remove Jeffrey Ledford as real estate commissioner. And, pressed by Deal, Farmer says, the legally independent panel replaced Ledford with William Rogers Jr.
Farmer predicts the commission, which polices Georgia's 93,000 licensed real estate agents, will become a "rubber stamp" for Deal. "That's ridiculous," counters Deal spokesman Brian Robinson. "We followed the correct process."
Not that long ago I trumpeted the plus points of visiting Keramas on Bali’s east coast to anyone that would listen. This tale takes us a little further south but still on the east coast. If you really are interested in organic experiences, ones that leave you with an overall feeling of joy and that rich sensation of engaging with the real world and in this case real Bali, then this one will do that, and dare I say a whole lot more. Penelope Jane Williams is a one of a kind woman. Passionate, thoughtful, engaging and intense in the nicest possible way.
Normally in the case of default, lenders are hesitant to throw good money after bad. But often, like in most bankruptcy cases, there is a need for additional finance to keep the business going. This is why lenders have a provision for priority finance, where the lenders are given top priority at the time of settlement. MUMBAI: Minority lenders that are part of the consortium that has lent to Jet Airways have agreed to grant priority status to funding that would be provided by State Bank of India + (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB).
EAST LANSING — Michigan State has lost to North Carolina in football stadiums, the Dean Dome and on an aircraft carrier. Now they’ve lost to them at the Breslin Center, as well. The top-ranked Spartans never led in Wednesday night’s 79-65 loss to the unranked Tar Heels, their seventh straight defeat to North Carolina. None of the other six games were in East Lansing, but a fired-up home crowd didn’t help. North Carolina lost to Belmont and was coming off a defeat to Alabama-Birmingham, but the Spartans still shouldn’t have overlooked a team that had knocked off No.

Hundreds of middle school students gathered at Currie Middle School recently for the Tustin Unified Basketball Festival.
The spokesman for a faction of the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan said that the group intentionally targeted Christians in a suicide bombing which killed and wounded hundreds of women and children on Easter Sunday. “The target was Christians,” Ihsanullah Ihsan, the official spokesman of the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, said according to a statement obtained by The Long War Journal. Ihsan also said that Jamaat-ul-Ahrar wanted to “send a message to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that we have entered Lahore.” The group has been operating in Punjab province for nearly two years.
Are you a big holiday tipper? If so, you're probably in the minority, according to a national survey by Consumer Reports. Consumer Reports asked 1,900 people who they tipped and who they stiffed during the holiday season and found that the majority tipped just two types of people -- housekeepers and teachers -- and they didn't tip overwhelmingly generously. Everyone else was more likely to get stiffed than tipped, according to the survey. But that's based on the national average, said Tobie Stanger, a CR editor who led the research effort.

Agent Dale Cooper is back in "Twin Peaks," but he wouldn't be there without Minnesotan Mark Frost leading the way with longtime partner David Lynch. Mark Frost calls it the winter of his discontent. In January and February, he lost one of his best friends, actor Miguel Ferrer; neighbor Bill Paxton, who directed Frost’s golf film “The Greatest Game Ever Played”; and his father, Warren Frost, a beloved mentor in the Twin Cities theater scene. If the Minnesota-bred writer started the year in mourning, this summer is all about resurrection.
Twitter wants your money, or at least a new way to monetize all those characters you’re using up with more than those annoying sponsored tweets promoting nothing you ever want. According to Mashable, the social media company announced today that we’ll now be forced to steel our online shopping addiction while ranting about the day's hottest topic. There will be a “Buy Now” button on tweets for brands like Burberry and bands like Megadeth, where users can click and go right to where they can buy that fall trench coat or new metal album.
Murray said he directed both works at North Coast Repertory Theatre in 2002 and enjoyed them so much he wanted to repeat the experience. The two plays are actually connected by story, Murray said. “Travesties” is based on the true tale of Henry Carr, an elderly man, who during his performance in “The Importance of Being Earnest,” produced by James Joyce, reminisces about Zurich in 1917 during World War I. Because his reminisces go off track, he confuses his own story with the plot of “Being Earnest.” Carr ended up in a giant lawsuit with Joyce, who won.

The plans are expected to add more than 1,200 jobs in Southeast Michigan -- a signal that executives and experts say may be the start of an automotive job renaissance.

China on Monday accused Japan's prime minister of hypocrisy and said he would not be welcome in China after he visited a shrine honoring Japan's war dead, the latest sign of worsening ties between the two nations. Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to the Yasukuni shrine in central Tokyo had seriously hurt relations between the countries and shut the door for dialogue between their leaders. "Abe's hypocrisy in his claims of prioritizing relations with China and hopes for dialogue with the Chinese leaders has been fully revealed," Qin said at a regular briefing.
Could Strengthening the Association Between Antisemitism and Mental Illness Help to Curb It? This antisemitic sign targeting Jews at Yale University was posted in New Haven, Conn. Photo: Twitter. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) removed homosexuality from its official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM.) Aside from defusing the anger and shame of many gays and lesbians — which helped to improve their mental health — the APA shift facilitated great strides in the social, cultural, political, and legal arenas in subsequent decades.
Restaurant critic Amy Pataki and her family decided to rent chickens this summer. This is the sixth in an occasional series on backyard livestock. I live with six females: three human, three feathered. Each has her own qualities, habits and looks. Parents know this to be true of children — as do chicken experts. “Each chicken has a unique personality,” says Gail Damerow in animal husbandry bible Storey’s Guide to Raising Chickens. So, I felt up to the challenge when my editors asked me to profile our chickens’ personalities.

Bush left his beloved Texas for the final time yesterday, headed to Washington as the nation paid tribute to the 41st president for a lifetime of public service that began in the Navy during World War II, ended with four years as president and was characterised throughout by what admirers say was decency, generosity and kindness.
TENNESSEE VALLEY– A front positioned across north Alabama combined with extreme heat and humidity was all it took to ignite powerful summertime storms Saturday afternoon and evening. The strongest storms occurred in eastern Madison, northern Marshall and southern Lincoln County. Severe thunderstorm warnings were posted by the National Weather Service in Huntsville because the storms were capable of producing hail and strong, gusty winds. Several WHNT News 19 viewers reported hail in parts of Madison County between 6 and 7 p.m. One report published by the National Weather Service in Huntsville said half dollar-sized hail (1.25 inches) was reported in Moores Mill.

BlackBerry's Devices Get Dumped in the U.S. Senate, But Does It Matter? The former smartphone leader loses another key market, but it probably won’t hurt its core software business. BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) often highlights the use of its devices among government employees as a niche market which is defensible against Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android devices. In the past, BlackBerry argued that government agencies wouldn't forsake its "best in breed" end-to-end security for the convenience of using more popular iOS or Android devices.
The MHA also cautioned the state government about adopting transparency while recruiting to avoid a situation like previous years when there were complaints of rampant corruption and nepotism during recruitment of SPOs in Kashmir. The Union Home Ministry has for the first time sanctioned the setting up of two Reserve Battalions in Jammu and Kashmir that will comprise youths living in the border areas. One battalion each for Jammu and Kashmir has been approved with 2,014 posts and Rs 105 crore financial outlay, according to the Standing Committee on Security Related Expenditure headed by Union home secretary Rajiv Gauba, officials said.

July 1-4 event aims to put into action Pope Francis’ Evangelii Gaudium. ORLANDO, Fla. — The Catholic bishops in the United States want to form a Church of missionary disciples on fire to spread the joy of the Gospel to their communities. To be held July 1-4 in Orlando, Florida, it will be a gathering of thousands of Catholic leaders working in dioceses, apostolates and movements across the country. Having the U.S. bishops bring together Catholic leaders from all U.S. states and territories into a single meeting place to discuss evangelization has no precedent in the life of the Catholic Church in the United States.

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- Wake Forest's all-everything linebacker Aaron Curry was up to speed on his NFL history, at least enough to know that a linebacker hasn't been selected first overall in more than 20 years. He didn't know much about Aundray Bruce, who the Falcons selected No. 1 in 1988. That's probably a good thing since Bruce, kindly put, didn't live up to his draft position, although he did last for 11 seasons. While Curry wasn't precise on the particulars, he knows he wants to rewrite history and be the No.
Anna Heinrich sported an unusual bikini in Byron Bay. Anna Heinrich has baffled fans over her optical-illusion bikini. Currently in Byron Bay with hubby, former Bachelor Tim Robards, the blond-haired beauty posted an Instagram snap of herself posing in what appears to be a striped, nautical red-and-white bikini.

"This kind of thing can keep people up at night."

John Griffin is serving a life sentence for the first-degree murder of Denis Poirier. A former professional boxer and convicted killer with ties to the West End Gang has applied for a so-called faint-hope clause hearing in an effort to be eligible for parole later this year, instead of a decade from now, while he continues to serve a life sentence for a cold-blooded murder. John Griffin, 60, is serving a life sentence for the first-degree murder of Denis Poirier, a man who was shot while urinating in a parking lot near the Atwater Market in 2003.

Readers may be familiar with the fundamental changes that took place in the Roman world as it converted from paganism to Christianity in the fourth century, and as its emperors sought to govern, through the turbulent times of the fifth to seventh centuries, as Christian rulers. This is the stuff of late antiquity as it would be recognised in any classics or history university department. It is, as Tom Holland points out in the opening pages of his latest book, a period of fundamental importance for the shape of our world, as it is the era in which religious monotheism, rather than political kingdom, comes to dominate history.
The decision sent tremors through the music industry: Both big players like Apple and Amazon and smaller rivals like SoundCloud and Tidal will be affected. The news that music streaming giant Spotify has filed to go public in the first half of 2018 is reverberating through the music industry, leaving its rivals either terrified or under pressure to spend a lot more to compete. The move is a milestone given that Spotify is the first stand-alone streaming business to go public–even though it’s not preparing for a traditional IPO but is readying its stock to be publicly traded through a direct listing.
Many aren't ready to line up behind Trump and hope for a contested convention. Marco Rubio ended his bid for the GOP nomination Tuesday. TALLAHASSEE — They are too wounded to know what to do next. While Gov. Rick Scott has thrown his support behind Donald Trump and called on Florida Republicans to unite behind the brash real estate tycoon, Marco Rubio loyalists just aren't there yet. "It is very difficult for me to see Rubio move on," said state Rep. Julio Gonzalez, R-Venice, a member of Rubio's Florida leadership team.
Lately I’ve been dreaming of moving to the country. There’s something about the chance to work closely with the land, to have more chooks than suburban living allows, to grow one’s own fruit and vegetables, that I yearn for. I know this is not a unique dream—the possibility of escaping into the country seems to hold out a tantalising promise to many of us. Poets and writers have been romanticising the country, the pastoral life, since at least the 3rd century bc when Theocritus poetically idealised rural life in his Idylls.

Rowe, the Panthers’ general manager since May, said he “didn’t want to overload” his team with “too much information” on his first day as they prepared to play the Blackhawks in their first game back from a long road trip. “A lot of times we’re going to concern ourselves with our team more than the opponent,” said Rowe, who, before Tuesday, had not led a team in a practice since leaving the AHL Portland Pirates to become Florida’s associate general manager in December.
RANGERS boss Pedro Caixinha is thrilled Scott Brown is available to play in the Scottish Cup semi-final – because he wants to beat Celtic’s best team. And he has no problems with Celtic exploiting a disciplinary loophole to free their captain for the Hampden showdown, after he was sent off against Ross County last weekend, having launched an appeal. Asked which Hoops player he feared most ahead of his Old Firm debut, Caixinha said: “All of the team. And I’m glad Brown can play because it’s going to make it a very interesting match.

The deputy summoned help and didn't stop until backup arrived. A Taylor County Sheriff's Office spokesman says the deputy was terminated for violating office policies on inmate safety and security.

Irish physician William O'Shaughnessy is credited with popularizing medical marijuana use in the West. He used it to treat the pain associated with rheumatism as well as rabies, cholera, and tetanus. 3. Does marijuana smoke contain carcinogens (like tobacco smoke)? A 2005 study found that while marijuana and tobacco smoke were not equally carcinogenic, both types of smoke contain carcinogens and "particulate matter" associated with enhancing the carcinogenic effects of the smoke.
Construction crews renovating the future home of Harvard Student Agencies (HSA) cut into a gas pipe yesterday afternoon, forcing an evacuation of the building. Workers in the basement of the recently-christened Burke-McCoy Hall began to smell gas around 2:35 p.m. after they cut into a "charged" pipe they were told was empty, said Ken Trecartin, the construction superintendent. Two Cambridge fire trucks and one ambulance were called to the scene. "All the workers had been evacuated when we arrived, and there had already been a temporary patch put on the line," said Cambridge Deputy Fire Chief John O'Donoughue.

The Web is becoming a more effective tool over time to classify businesses than traditional industry classification schemes. The competitors I had three months ago are not necessarily the competitors I’m going to have three months from now -- or even today -- because business changes at the speed of light, as the Internet pumps information around the world and business strategies change on a dime.

You can take your time planting flowers for shady areas, such as bedding begonia, forget-me-not, caladiums, coleus, mimulus, torenia and impatiens.
ARSENAL star Mesut Ozil is ‘hoping’ that he is sold in January and he probably will be. That is the view of ESPN FC pundit and former Liverpool right-back Steve Nicol. The German midfielder seems to have been frozen out by Gunners boss Unai Emery in recent weeks after several below par performances. It had previously looked like the 30-year-old had a future at the Emirates after he was made the highest paid player at the club in January. Ozil signed a £350,000-a-week deal and it seemed then that former Sevilla boss Emery wanted to build his team around him.
“Pulse” at the Hirshhorn Museum lets visitors contribute to a masterpiece. At Rafael Lozano- ­Hemmer’s new exhibit, the art comes alive but only if you follow one rule: You must participate. But don’t worry, you won’t be graded. The exhibit is called “Pulse,” and it opened last week at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington. It has three installations that create art by collecting visitors’ biometric data. (Biometric data is information that identifies your body. A fingerprint is one example.)
There’s been drama around the House Judiciary Committee’s Matt Whitaker hearing, with all sort of procedural and legal back and forth between the committee and the administration and charges and counter-charges between Democrats and Republicans. It’s quite the spectacle, but it’s really how this should work. It isn’t an executive branch agency deciding to investigate the chief executive after he hires its head. It isn’t a subordinate executive branch official being given the responsibility to undertake what is, in effect, an impeachment inquiry. It isn’t, in short, the executive devouring itself.
A funnel cloud was spotted Wednesday, June 12, over Hanover, Ill.
Tornado watches and warnings stretched over the Midwest overnight Wednesday as a massive storm system menaced the biggest cities in the region, pushing tornadoes, extraordinary winds and heavy rain — and perhaps even a derecho, an explosive wind pattern that's like a hurricane on land. A tornado was spotted about 7 p.m. (8 p.m. ET) near Savanna in Carroll County in northwest Illinois. A county sheriff's dispatcher told NBC News there were some reports of injuries, but it was too early to have any indication of their number or severity.

Investors balked at extending the market�s recent rally Friday despite an improved outlook from Intel Corp.
Stocks closed mostly lower, as losses among health care stocks offset small gains in technology companies. The Dow Jones industrial average lost about 36 points, breaking an eight-day winning streak. Trading was quiet, as it has been all week, as summer vacations kept many traders out of the market. With fewer participants, the market lost some of its recent momentum that had sent the major indexes up about 5 percent in less than two weeks. Stocks managed to carve out their sixth weekly advance in seven weeks, but the gains were minimal.

Yuri Gagarin was the first man in outer space, when he orbited the earth in the first manned space flight exactly fifty years ago. Gagarin was for a brief time the most famous man on earth and hailed as a hero by millions around the world. However, the cosmonaut did not get to enjoy his celebrity – he died just seven years later in a mysterious plane crash that has generated a mountain of conspiracy theories. Gagarin died on Mar. 27, 1968 when the MiG fighter plane that carried him and instructor Vladimir Seryogin crashed in the Vladimir region just outside Moscow.
The South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) has hit back at allegations levelled against the union by trade union federation Cosatu. Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali reportedly claimed that leaders of Samwu are running away from members and not accounting for the use of union money. Ntshalintshali told The Star that the leadership of Samwu, the country’s biggest municipal union, were refusing to co-operate with the federation. “We tried to set up a task team outside of the Cosatu national office-bearers and included leaders from other affiliates to deal with this issue, but the national office-bearers of Samwu are refusing to co-operate.
Doctors first declared him ‘brought dead’ to the hospital, but Tariq Ahmad Kantroo survived a bullet in his head during the tumult of 2010. That injury left his life so devastated that he now wishes he hadn’t survived. But Kantroo’s only wish now is to be able to lead a dignified life and contribute to his family. In August 2010, Kantroo, 31, was on his way to a the sub district hospital in Tral for a checkup when paramilitary troopers chasing protestors caught hold of his collar and fired at him, he says trying to overcome difficulty talking and tears slipping down his face.

LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) - Aluminium touched a one-week high on Wednesday as inventories fell and prices shrugged off another step towards a full restart of Norsk Hydro's Brazil alumina operations. "We need to be cautious in terms of regulatory aspects in Brazil at the moment considering how volatile the news flow has been around Vale, with courts allowing restarts and other courts blocking it again," he said. At full capacity Alunorte can produce some 6.4 million tonnes of alumina - the raw material for aluminium - or 10 percent of the world's capacity outside China.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending slowed in October as the hurricane-related boost to motor vehicle purchases faded, while a sustained increase in underlying price pressures suggested that a recent disinflationary trend had probably run its course. Other data on Thursday showed a second straight weekly drop in first-time applications for unemployment benefits, pointing to a further tightening in labor market conditions that could soon generate faster wage growth and keep consumer spending supported, as well as push inflation higher. The reports strengthened expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. The U.S. central bank has increased borrowing costs twice this year.

Brian Rice hopes Hamilton fans enjoyed their superb win over Hearts, and hopes it helps to ease the pain of last week’s derby defeat. But the head coach insists beating Hearts is just three more points. Under Rice, Accies have beat St Johnstone, Aberdeen and Hearts, and drawn with Dundee, but he said: “I would like to take three points from anybody. A win is a win, it’s only three points, whether it’s a team from the top six or the bottom six.
National leaders rely too much upon hope. This will make them both dependent on the always-problematic assumption of rationality. of possibly no return. For Israel, the ultimate cost of this inaction could be existential. Why? National leaders rely upon hope. Again and again, however, they hope too much. Sometimes, this misplaced optimism has the emotionally satisfying, but strategically injurious, effect of blocking off productive policies. It may even have the effect of encouraging catastrophic war and terrorism. Notwithstanding the right of anticipatory self-defense under international law, neither Israel nor the United States has been willing to act preemptively.
But Pakistan almost certainly would have been aware that a drone had entered its airspace, others have said, because of a three-tiered coordination and liaison arrangement that stations 26 Pakistani military officers with U.S. troops in Kabul, Afghanistan. Additionally, the drone’s presence would have been detected by Pakistan’s air defense radars deployed to monitor the northwest border with Afghanistan and the air corridors in the North Waziristan and South Waziristan tribal areas. Those radars can track aircraft, including drones, flying as high as 50,000 feet, according to army and air forces officers who’ve previously worked along the border.

In March, The Tico Times reported that the Ministry of Agriculture would post on its Web site by the end of June the results of a study about pesticide residues on our fruits and vegetables.We could not locate such a report.Could you tell us how to find it, or could you find out some of the results? Are there certain foods the study revealed we should be especially leery of consuming? It appears the information you’re looking for is very late, but supposedly on the way. The complex process has taken the ministry longer than anticipated, she said.
For King Khan, Big B is still the super star of Bollywood. Asked about his super status at a press conference here, Shah Rukh Khan said the credit for his success should be given to "people who work behind scenes". It would be wrong for him to claim the whole credit for his current status, said King Khan. The super star said Big B remains "the most stunning actor and a gentleman". Shah Rukh Khan said the media has created a myth that film stars are petty-minded people who get together under one roof at awards ceremonies.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) led Republicans this week in an effort to defund Planned Parenthood for a practice he supported and voted for in Congress. The campaign came after doctored videos were released purporting to prove that Planned Parenthood offered fetal tissue for sale. The videos, made by an anti-abortion group, were proven to have been edited to deceptively show Planned Parenthood offered the tissue for sale. California’s attorney general, Kamala Harris, is now investigating those who produced the videos. Planned Parenthood does legally offer fetal tissue for research, but recovers only its costs in providing it.

The 5.2-inch Xperia Z4 comes after the company confirmed thousands of job cuts in its mobile division earlier this year.

(WSVN) - When you own a business, you have to advertise … ads on TV, things like that help. And something else is needed — a sign out front so people know you are there.

Now try running a small business by yourself. But Debbie says her landlord is not putting its customers first.
A blast of arctic air is forecast to make its way through South Florida on Friday, dropping weekend temperatures by double digits. The timing of the front is still a little unpredictable, but current forecasts have it moving through Friday night, leaving Saturday morning to shiver in the high 50s with a daytime temperature that will struggle to reach 70.

As of this morning, the guidance shows Friday staying warm at about 78 degrees with a 50 percent chance of rain.
EUSTIS — A California-based company that recently debuted a medical marijuana farm in Eustis says it has taken a number of steps to mute the noise and other operational issues that are bugging neighbors, but the neighbors say it isn't nearly enough. Neighbors have complained to the farm's owners, MedMen, which took over the old Treadwell Nursery last year on County Road 44A. They have also approached the Lake County Commission and state officials. But Ted and Vickie Miller, who live directly next door to the five-acre operation, say they can barely stand being there any longer.

Solapur: Drought has tightened its grip over Maharashtra. But ask the people of the drought hit village of Ropala in Solapur district, the epicentre of Maharahstra's drought, and they will tell you it is a crisis created not by nature but political clout. The villagers live just a few miles from the Ujani dam, one of Maharashtra's biggest, but don't receive a drop if its water. They claim it's because influential people divert the water, a surprising claim given that Ropala village falls in Madha, the Lok Sabha constituency of Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar.
EAST RUTHERFORD — Landon Collins isn't worried much about the scoring struggles of the Giants' offense, real or perceived. To a man, the Giants' defense is focused on the opposing offenses and making sure those teams - in the case of this Monday night, the Detroit Lions - struggle even more. "If we want the standard to be that we're a great defense, then it's not pressure to expect to keep a zero on the scoreboard," Collins told The Record and NorthJersey.com at his locker after practice Friday.
As with O2 there, so with AT&T here or more accurately with myself. Give the phone gratis and I'd ship it back out of pocket. It still begs the question, why the exclusive arrangements? I actually like the idea of the Fire Phone and I'm not committed at all to Amazon. (Newegg, &c, yeah) The instant lookups would suit the extended families just fine. Betcha I'd want a commission on each additional phone. No AT&T, period, from all of us to all of Amazon.

James Freeman says he’s always wanted to have some Blue Bottle products in a nice grocery store, but he always cringed at the thought of good beans withering away on shelves for too long. His solution: For the past year or so, he’s been working on a Blue Bottle iced coffee to sell … in bottles (!). He’s finally got it, and as of this week, Blue Bottle’s two iced coffees — Kyoto and New Orleans — are available in bottled form (see above) at the Ferry Building shop and Oakland’s Webster Street roastery.
Dial it. And waiting on the other end of the line you’ll find volunteers who aim to reunited dozens of faithful, furry and probably a little freaked-out animals hoping to somehow find their way back home. The San Francisco SPCA has joined ranks with scores of other pet shelters, vet clinics and assorted caring souls across Northern California to come to the rescue of the four-legged survivors of the deadly Camp Fire. The pets are homeless for now — their injuries ranging from singed fur to severe burns that are now being treated.

As we enter 2019, the question on everyone’s mind is: can we say goodbye to market volatility that 2018 unleashed upon us? The answer may not be that simple. By the end of 2018, while the Nifty50 gained a mere 3.5 percent over past one year, the mid-cap index and Nifty small-cap index lost 15.45 percent and 28.59 percent, respectively. The divergence between the large-cap stocks and the rest of the stocks, made many investors turn risk-averse. Although investors continued with their systematic investment plans (SIP), the outcomes varied.

She also interviewed 31 health professionals involved in infant care. She found that mothers seemed to be confidently following guidelines they had gleaned themselves either through others, literature or the internet, and that many felt intuitively that it was the best way to feed their baby.

It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas on Teesside. The trees are up - and Santa has even made an early appearance! Father Christmas swapped the North Pole on Saturday for Hemlington’s Viewley Hill Shopping Centre. And he got some practice in for his round-the-world gift giving mission in a few weeks time by also nipping over to Billingham to greet kids at the town’s 9th traditional Christmas event. But Santa wasn’t the only big name to visit Teesside on Saturday. Music star Alistair Griffin, from Fame Academy, opened the Christmas Tree Festival at Acklam’s St Mary’s Church.
PHILADELPHIA - Flyers forward Simon Gagne reiterated that he will sit out the rest of the season because of lingering symptoms from a series of concussions, with one caveat: A trip to the Stanley Cup final. "I'm going in the right direction like I want," he said. "I'm sure I'd like to be 100 per cent right away, but I know it's going to take time. We've got a long period of time in front of me before I start playing again." Gagne had his first concussion Oct. 24 when he was hit in the jaw by Panthers defenceman Jay Bouwmeester.

Mike Madrid's "Divas, Dames & Daredevils: Lost Heroines of Golden Age Comics" looks at pre-code characters from 1938-54. Mike Madrid became a fan of comics when he was a kid in the 1970s. He says he found himself drawn to the female characters and their story arcs. "I felt that they were allowed to have more developed personalities than a lot of the men in comics," Madrid says. "A lot of the men had to be brave and fearless, and that was the extent of it, but women could have that and show more emotion."
The will-she-or-won’t-she question on Clinton’s turn to the left. Senator Bernie Sanders is drawing crowds of thousands at campaign events and gaining momentum at a pace that suggests there is a real Democratic hunger for more populist and progressive—or, as Sanders calls himself, “Democratic socialist”—policies. That means Hillary Clinton, long presumed to be the front-runner in the fight for the Democratic nomination for president, needs to sharpen her rhetoric on regulation and income inequality. Despite sounding an increasingly populist note during her campaign, Clinton is hardly known as a foe of the financial industry.
China has sentenced a prominent civil rights lawyer to two years in prison in a trial that was denounced as political theatre by critics. Jiang Tianyong, whose past clients include a wide range of activists such as the exiled dissident lawyer Chen Guangcheng, was sentenced on charges of “inciting subversion of state power” in the central city of Changsha on Tuesday morning, after languishing in detention for the past year. Jiang said he would not appeal against the conviction, according to the court’s official social media account. He was also deprived of political rights for three years.
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Erin, thanks very much. Good evening, everyone. We have breaking news tonight. Exclusive new details that you will only see on this program about the attack in Libya that killed four Americans, including ambassador Christopher Stevens and two former Navy Seals, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods. They died heroes, we have known that. But until tonight, we had no idea of just how far beyond the call of duty these two men went. And again, you will be learning this right now for the very first time only on "360."

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans' confidence in the U.S. economy retreated last week, with the U.S. Economic Confidence Index averaging -14 for the week ending April 10. This is down from -10 in the previous week, and is in the lower range of what Gallup has measured over the past year. The latest index score is the lowest by one point since the first week of November 2015, but not materially different from most scores since then, which have ranged primarily between -10 and -13. Last week's -14 index score masks a period of falling and then rising confidence.
Paul Allen's cause of death was the septic shock brought on by his battle with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ... TMZ has learned. We obtained Allen's death certificate, and it lists septic shock and immunosuppression as causes of death ... but both were clearly the result of his cancer. According to the document ...

(TheStreet) -- The sudden departure of Chief Operating Officer Tom Rutledge at Cablevision(:CVC) has analysts wondering if the company is a buyout target in the coming months.

Got a news item from our tip line today that I'm confirming but I thought I would bring it to your attention. Seems that the French are potentially jumping on the SCAR bandwagon with a limited deployment of 10 SCARs to its contingent in Afghanistan and Sudan. Our tipster pointed us to a French blog called The Mammoth that said the French National Police officers stationed in Kabul and Khartum, Sudan, will get the 7.62mm Mk-17s. It seems that the forward deployed paramilitary police troops are also tinkering with the H&K 417 "for additional firepower."
The Port of Oakland is scheduled to approve a new contract with its workers at today's board meeting, but the port — the total workforce of which is divided between the agency's own public employees, and the employees of numerous corporate contractors who run the maritime and airport operations — remains unsettled with serious labor disputes.

At Oakland International Airport, workers represented by Unite HERE Local 2850 are now threatening to walk off the job because of an impasse in contract negotiations with a major contractor.

Do you insist on doing business with a live human being when you bank? It's going to cost you. Or, putting it another way, you can save money if you promise not to make any human contact with a teller. Welcome to the biggest trend among financial institutions: rewarding you for staying away from their employees. It's part of the industry's growing emphasis on caring for the more profitable, affluent customer, and penalizing folks who take up a teller's time with pesky little transactions and irritating questions.
Tigers started well, but had to come back strong after usual early season lull. ATLANTA — This was the start Auburn needed, and everything more. Exorcise those Atlanta demons. Prove you are the superior top-10 team from the start. Auburn did just that with a three-and-out to open on defense. A big punt return by Ryan Davis to set up the Tigers on offense. And a quick strike from Jarrett Stidham to Sal Cannella to start the scoring. No. 10 Auburn was bigger and stronger than sixth-ranked Washington, the prohibitive Pac-12 favorite, this was clear.
PORTLAND, Oregon (CNN)– The Tea Party Express rolled into Portland, Oregon, Friday and took aim at the city's left-leaning image. "It's great to be in a capital of liberalism," Tea Party Vice Chairman Mark Williams told a crowd of several hundred supporters who milled around the organization¹s two large tour buses. The event was held in a parking lot owned by a local Italian sausage sandwich shop. Before the invitation to host the rally there, organizers had spent several days trying to find a venue who would have them.
1 And he let me see Joshua, the high priest, in his place before the angel of the Lord, and the Satan at his right hand ready to take up a cause against him. 2 And the Lord said to the Satan, May the Lord's word be sharp against you, O Satan, the word of the Lord who has taken Jerusalem for himself: is this not a burning branch pulled out of the fire? 3 Now Joshua was clothed in unclean robes, and he was in his place before the angel. 5 And let them put a clean head-dress on his head.
Saints fans are not the only one outraged over the NFL’s lack of accountability in Sunday’s NFC Title game between New Orleans and the Rams. Louisiana’s governor is speaking out, as Gov. John Bel Edwards sent a letter Tuesday to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to express the “deep disappointment” of the people of Louisiana and Saints fans. The Democratic governor complained about the failure of officials to call interference or roughness penalties when a Rams player leveled a Saints receiver with a helmet-to-helmet hit near the end of Sunday’s game.
The Pro Football Hall of Fame is talking about becoming the center of a football-themed village. The Pro Football Hall of Fame has gone through four major expansions over the last 50 years. But if the newest proposal pans out, it will go way beyond its current Canton footprint – and even beyond football. WKSU’s M.L Schultze has more on the plan that proponents see as a transformation into a kind of Disney World of football. The answer has to do with the formation of the NFL in a Hupmobile dealership more than 90 years ago downtown.
JESSE LINGARD has had a pop at Cristiano Ronaldo - for having inferior abs. The Juventus striker scored a stunning volley for his side against old employers Manchester United in their Champions League clash in Turin. Many wondered whether the 33-year-old would celebrate a goal against his former loves. But celebrate he did, by pulling up his shirt to reveal his delightfully toned abdominal area. His joy was short lived however. United stunned the Italian giants with two goals in the last five minutes to keep their hopes of winning Group H well and truly alive.

On a sultry mid-July afternoon on this military base, a few hundred Marines, some with spouses and children in tow, were mustering for a free screening of the movie "Warrior" at a squat cement cinema house on Mainside, the section of the 200-square-mile facility reserved for civilian comforts like the Stars and Strikes bowling alley and Smokey's House of BBQ. In the film, which won't arrive in theaters until September, a Marine just home from Iraq (played by Englishman Tom Hardy) and his estranged brother, a fighter-turned-teacher (Australian Joel Edgerton), train for a mixed martial arts tournament.

While the suggestion of pollution-eating clothing may at first sound a little fanciful, or even utterly absurd, the fact is that thanks to the development of a special liquid laundry additive, it’s already a reality. The latest news is that scientists behind the pollution-busting creation are in talks with a manufacturer of environmentally friendly cleaning products in a bid to bring a detergent containing the additive to market. The additive, called ‘CatClo’ (short for Catalytic Clothing), is the result of a joint effort involving the UK’s University of Sheffield and London College of Fashion.
It was going to be tough, going against the top team in the state. And the Salpointe Lancers fell just short of winning another state title in the 4A conference, this time falling to perennial powerhouse Scottsdale Saguaro. Saguaro won their record 5th straight state championship. Lancers RB Mario Padilla called Saguaro "the definition of 4A football in the state of Arizona", earlier this week at practice. The game was scoreless heading in to the 2nd quarter, before Sabercats QB found Logan Pettijohn for a 36 yard touchdown. A Rodrigo Nieto interception set up another Sabercats TD, and Salpointe trailed 14-0 after 2 quarters.

Recent fighting in country's northeast has forced tens of thousands to flee since December of last year. A recent surge in fighting has plagued the northeastern territory of Ituri in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In a wave of attacks beginning in December of 2017, tens of thousands of members of the Hema community have fled the Djugu territory of Ituri to evade Lendu aggressors. More than 40,000 Congolese have fled the country to seek refuge in neighbouring Uganda, while tens of thousands more have travelled north towards the town of Mahagi and south towards the province's capital, Bunia.
"You are an idiot," the U.S. ambassador told Joseph Opala. Then 25 years old and finishing up a Peace Corps stint working with rice farmers in Sierra Leone, Opala had a degree in anthropology and no interest in viewing the 18th century ruins of a slave castle. Michael Samuels asked him to make just one visit, but 30 years later, Opala is still studying Bunce Island. More than anyone, he has put the island on the map of the transatlantic slave trade, linking tiny Bunce and Sierra Leone with the Gullah culture of the American South.

Queen's Park is obliged to pay close attention when one of its own top planners warns that a provincial strategy meant to reduce urban sprawl and protect the environment will, in fact, do the opposite. That's what's in store for the Simcoe region, north of the GTA, if Ontario proceeds with its flawed intentions, according to Victor Doyle, manager of community planning at the ministry of municipal affairs. Tellingly, this senior civil servant made his views known as a "private citizen," with a written response to the province's call for public input on the strategic growth plan for Simcoe.
Like many technology companies, Facebook must balance the convergence of digital dependence, digital dominance and digital distrust. Over 2 billion people worldwide check Facebook each month; 45 percent of American adults get their news from Facebook. Together with Google, it captures half of all digital advertising revenues worldwide. Yet more people say they greatly distrust Facebook than any other member of the big five – Amazon, Apple, Google or Microsoft. In March 2017 Facebook started taking responsibility for quality control as a way to restore users’ trust. The company hired fact-checkers to verify information in posts.

The company announced the acquisition will increase its servicing holdings by about $25 billion, and its originations by $10 billion annually. Multiple sources confirmed to HousingWire that Nationstar, also known as Mr. Cooper, is buying Pacific Union Financial.

If Vice President Mike Pence had only tried to avoid the appearance of impropriety, the example would work. But trying to avoid even meals with women alone inherently subordinates women when it comes to the business and political world he operates in. Liberals should be tolerant. But not of these examples. Julie Halatek, Wake Forest, N.C. It is true that President Donald Trump is sensitive to criticism. The inaccurate and biased coverage by the media of his views and actions has contributed to this sensitivity. He is also subjected to ridicule by his opponents in the political realm.

Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and evangelical Christian, says she gets slammed every day on social media for her contributions to establishing that climate change is human-made. But on Monday, she was welcomed with applause at a United Nations-backed climate summit in the capital of Canada's western province of Alberta, where polls show that climate skepticism rates are among the highest in the country. Hayhoe, a professor at Texas Tech University, has emerged in recent years as a leading voice sharing the science of climate change to skeptics - many of whom are fellow evangelical churchgoers.

President Donald Trump returned to Washington, DC on Monday for a very important event. It was not for a meeting with an international leader. And it was not for a joint session of Congress. No, on this day, Trump greeted thousands of children. They had come to the White House for the annual Easter Egg Roll. The event has been a U.S. tradition for more than a century. In the late 1800s, local children gathered on the hill beside the president’s house to play a game with their colored eggs following the Easter holiday.
In a bar in Chicago last week, these three guys invited me to a friendly poker game. They let me win the first couple of hands and then up the stage. Do you know I lost five thousand bucks by the time I realized I have been caught in a skin game? When the door opened, I almost jumped-out of my skin. There was my brother arms loaded with Christmas presents. He lives all the way out in California, but he decided to surprise me by flying to Washington for Christmas. Oh, there's Mr. Grey.
She brought him home to her house full of children, and a few days later, the social worker called. What happens when that absolutely adorable baby becomes a young adult. What then? Nechama and Yakov were genetically ill-matched, but deeply in love and consistently kind to one another, even under such duress.

Craig Grant, founder and operator of nonprofit so-called ‘cat sanctuary’ Caboodle Ranch was arrested for the neglect and abuse of nearly 700 cats in his care. On Apr. 2, donors and former owners of many of those cats formed a class action lawsuit that will eventually be filed against Grant. Records from the Lee, Fla.-based ‘ranch’ show that Grant embezzled and misappropriated donations (meant for the care of the cats) for his own personal uses: trips to Las Vegas, tickets to Disney on Ice and the Daytona 500, and personal online purchases.
“In Atlanta, with Delta (Airlines) getting so big and busy ... a lot of these charter operations struggle to get a space that operates on their timeline,” D’Leon said. Work continues behind the scenes to see if there will be more chances to partner with an airline and casino for more charter flights, he said. The airport’s commercial flight service expanded in December when Contour Airlines began flying to and from Tampa, Florida. The regional airport was able to surpass a passenger milestone in 2018 that will give it access to a $1 million federal grant.
The FDA has rejected a petition to ban certain antibiotics for use in livestock that are important for the preservation of human health. The two petitions, filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, Environmental Defense, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, Food Animal Concerns Trust (FACT), and the Union of Concerned Scientists, were requested in 1999 and 2005, according to Food Safety News. [T]he agency cited statutory hurdles -- such as a notice to the drug maker and an evidentiary hearing on the matter -- as reason to deny the petition.

Compared to the Waste Management Open's raucous, rowdy thrill ride, the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am projects a more subdued levity. With the notable caveat of Bill Murray. From tossing spectators into bunkers to hitting exploding golf balls and stealing children from the gallery, the comedian and Oscar nominee has become part of the tournament's attraction, sometimes more so than the professional players. Which makes the following news cause for creating sand angels: After his participation was in doubt following hand surgery, Murray has committed to this year's pro-am.

UNITED NATIONS, August 10, updated below -- In the run-up to Wednesday's UN Security Council "update" meeting on Syria, there was a preliminary skirmish in the Council as to whether the update, to be given by Assistant Secretary General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco, should be given only in closed door consultations, as requested by Russia and some others, or in the Council's larger chamber. At 3 pm it emerged it would be in the smaller consultations room.

I love roasted peaches, especially when their deliciously caramelized flesh is drizzed with a sweet pine nut sauce. If you don’t have peaches on hand, swap in nectarines or large plums. In a small microwave-safe bowl, whisk together butter, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon maple syrup. Microwave for 30 to 60 seconds or until butter is melted. Stir well. Place peaches cut side up in a baking dish. Brush with butter mixture. Roast for 10 to 15 minutes or until peaches are lightly browned. Meanwhile, in a food processor, combine pine nuts, maple syrup, and salt.
Years ago, Robert Frost wrote about a road less traveled, but even the famed poet couldn�t have envisioned the route Geneva senior Rocco Colavecchia has taken. At Shenango High School, he rewrote the record book, passing for more than 4000 yards in his career. From Shenango, he went to Kent State. He transferred to Slippery Rock when he was moved to tight end. Then, he moved on to Geneva. He always believed he was a quarterback. The Golden Tornadoes gave him a shot behind center and he�s set to finish his career this year with school records -- but not the ones he expected.

A review of available data from tsunami events puts these losses at 251,770 deaths and $280 billion out of recorded economic losses for earthquakes and tsunamis of $661.5 billion (1998-2017). The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction has sought attention to the significant loss of life and economic losses worth $280 billion associated with tsunamis, notably for countries bordering the Indian and Pacific Oceans, over the last twenty years. The figures came on Friday from the emergency events database maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, based at the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium.

Facebook is currently the second most popular website in the world after Alphabet&apos;s Google, according to site tracker Alexa, with over a billion daily active users. That massive user base is helping Facebook expand its ecosystem deep into Google&apos;s backyard. Over the past 12 months, investors have aggressively bought both stocks.

THE completion of major carriage way cutting through Glasgow's east end and linking two of the country's busiest stretches of motorway is to be given the go-ahead. Councillors are on course to approve the final stages of the East End Regeneration Route (EERR), which will connect the M8/M80 and M74 with a four-carriageway link scheduled for completion in around 2021. Like previous stages of the road's development, the £60million completion section cuts through residential areas of the east end, requiring a major eight-span viaduct to take it across the Glasgow to Airdrie railway line at the city's Duke Street.

Three health care workers who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor violations of federal health confidentiality law for looking at the St. Vincent Infirmary medical records of Anne Pressly, received probationary sentences today. Pressly, a KATV reporter, died of injuries from a beating by an intruder in her home about a year ago. Curtis Vance faces a capital murder charge in the death. All three defendants received one-year probationary sentences and varying fines, payable in installments. Candida Griffin, a former emergency room coordinator, looked at the records three times. She also was fined $1,500.
Thousands of people are in Youngstown this weekend armed with small pointy objects. It's all part of a charity dart tournament with a group that's once again on the rise. At some point in your life, you've probably thrown a dart or two, but the Youngstown Dart Association takes it to a whole new level. It's a non-profit group that's been around since the 1980s and after some lean years, it's back in a big way. "We started out with five teams and worked up now to 54 teams with 500+ members," said YDA president Carl Clay.
“By the time I opened the door, all I could see was black smoke,” said Sutton, 32. He dashed to a back bedroom and hollered at a neighbor. Hearing sirens, Sutton decided to ignore a neighbor’s suggestion that he jump and wait instead for firefighters, who soon put a ladder up to the bedroom window. Sutton scrambled down to safety. Firefighters also rescued his sister’s pet snapping turtle, Speedy, from the blaze in the four-unit apartment building at 9309 Newton Ave. No residents were injured in the fire, officials said.
So, does Disturbia, a teen-beat remake of Rear Window, imply that Hollywood is finally moving on from its obsession with underage remakes of Shakespeare plays? If so, it's just as well: At least it'll mean some less-played-out stories. Granted, it's harder to avoid comparing a remake with the original when both originated in the same medium. Still, while Disturbia doesn't live up to Rear Window—or credit it, though the parallels are unmissable—and it's often annoyingly fluffy where Rear Window is grim, it eventually evolves into a credible thriller, one pointedly rather than coincidentally embedded in the trivia of its time.
Dr. Erica Saphire, a scientist with the Scripps Research Institute, who used crowdfunding to research a cure for Ebola. As health-care officials scramble to contain the worsening Ebola outbreak around the world, an unusual fundraising effort from a leading institute has struck a chord with the general public. Dr. Erica Saphire and the Scripps Research Institute were part of the consortium that developed the ZMapp serum, the experimental drug believed to have cured five people infected with Ebola this summer. To create a road map for new treatments, though, they needed new equipment—and fast.

When Elena Meirzadeh immigrated to Israel from Iran with her family at the age of 12, her priorities were perfecting her Hebrew and acclimating to life in a new country. Despite the language barrier and culture shock at moving from the Islamic Republic to the Jewish state, Meirzadeh excelled at her studies and decided she wanted to become a scientist. While pursuing an undergraduate degree at an Israeli university, she attended a two-week summer program at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. It was there she discovered the joy of being in a top-notch laboratory working alongside established scientists.
"We shall have to repent in this generation not so much for the evil deeds of the wicked people, but for the appalling silence of the good people." "A strong civil society promotes responsible citizenship and makes democratic forms of government work. A weak civil society supports authoritarian rule, which keeps society weak." (February 12, Colombo, Sri Lanka Guardian) The Citizen's Movement for Good Governance (CIMOGG) is one of the few civil society organisations in Sri Lanka which has consistently stood up for civil rights and good governance in our country.
Reece MacMillan could be in line for his first title fight after picking up his sixth professional win in Bolton on Saturday night. The Morecambe super lightweight got the better of an action-packed four-round contest with Innocent Anyanwu at the Macron Stadium. The two fighters went toe-to-toe on the undercard of Hughie Fury’s British heavyweight title win against Sam Sexton with the former Skerton ABC youngster getting the nod 40-37 on referee Phil Edwards’ card. Now the 22-year-old, 6-1, is hoping to keep busy with a title contest possible for later in the year.
The Nationals dropped the rubber game of their three-game series with the Indians Sunday, losing 2-0 -- and spoiling Stephen Strasburg's return from injury -- while hitting 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position (including leaving a runner stranded at third with no outs on three separate occasions). Through 68 games, Washington is averaging 3.49 runs per game, second-worst in the majors behind only Miami's 3.13. What's even more startling is how the Nationals scored their eight runs over three games against the Indians: five solo home runs (all on Saturday), two wild pitches and one double-play grounder.
Irons responded Thursday by saying he is thankful to those who supported him through the recall process and hopes to move on to focus on city business. The group of opponents made several complaints against Irons, including his push to remove former City Manager Andrea Lueker and former City Attorney Rob Schultz, as well as his support for the relocation of the sewer plant, which they say will cost the city millions of dollars. Irons has defended his actions, noting that two other council members, Noah Smukler and Christine Johnson, agreed to move forward with employment discussions about Lueker and Schultz that ultimately led to their resignations.
With the launch of its first UK boutique just months away, British fans of American fashion brand J.Crew will no longer be forced to rely on its website for their fashion fix. But while you won't have to go far to get your hands on the brand loved by Michelle Obama, Anna Wintour and Beyonce among others, you'll be paying through the nose for the privilege. And it isn't just J.Crew that is charging British shoppers more than their American counterparts. Other US brands including Abercrombie & Fitch, Ralph Lauren and American Apparel are doing it too.
Nearly two months to the day after British-born film director and producer Tony Scott leaped to his death from the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro, California, the autopsy and toxicology report results are in. LA County coroner's officials have released the final cause of death in the 68-year-old's suicide, and the answers are both tragic and unsurprising: Tony Scott died of multiple blunt-force injuries from the 185-foot drop. According to the chief coroner investigator, no evidence was found that Scott had any serious underlying medical conditions, despite widespread rumors that he'd been suffering from inoperable brain cancer before his death.
MEMPHIS, Tenn. — MLGW is warning people about a scam that's making its rounds on social media. Customers called WREG filled with false hope after spotting a post in a Facebook group. Nancy Crawford, with the Better Business Bureau, says scams like this usually surface during the summer when it's really hot and people are in need for cash and are short on their bills. "It's called an impostor scam, and they use the name of a reputable company. If people are offering to help you out, people are going to want to take advantage of that.," Crawford said.
MANNING Ratz will have to improve their discipline and contain Wallamba’s backline aces James Handford and Chris Tout if they are going to progress to the Lower North Coast Rugby Union grand final. Captain-coach Jake Maurirere said this as the Ratz prepare to tackle Wallamba in the final tomorrow at Nabiac. Winner will move to the decider against Forster-Tuncurry at Tuncurry on Saturday September 22. The Ratz also have a couple of injury concerns. Centre Toby De Stefano and fullback Reece Holden were both causalities in Manning’s 55-13 demolition of an understrength Gloucester in the minor semi-final.
WARSAW, Poland (AP) - A prominent left-wing politician aiming to become Poland's prime minister, says he wants to shut down all coal mines operating in the country by 2035, improve health care and end state subsidies to the church. Robert Biedron listed those among other proposals Friday in Warsaw. The last national elections, in 2015, brought a right-wing party to power and deprived left-wing parties of any seats in parliament. Ahead of elections next year, some liberal Poles have put their hopes for change in Biedron, a charismatic and openly gay 42-year-old.
While Millennials are a much talked about demographic, there are many brands out there with little understanding, so instead just ‘do something online’ in an effort to connect with these young guys, argues Lauren Wilkin and Colin MacArthur from research company, Jigsaw. Spoiled, selfish, ambitious, connected, immature, tech-savvy, demanding, open-minded, fame-seeking, over-sharing. These are just some of the words that are commonly used to describe young consumers, (the so-called ‘Gen Y’ or ‘Millennials’). And there is a perception among some marketers that this target audience is particularly enigmatic and hard to connect with.
In the early nineteen-fifties, the United States government embarked on a top-secret endeavor to build a network of nuclear-missile launch stations beneath Greenland’s ice sheet. The initiative, known as Project Iceworm, faced a long list of challenges, chief among them a lack of essential knowledge about the deep structure of glaciers. At the time, sophisticated techniques for efficiently tunnelling through the cryosphere—the frozen parts of Earth’s surface—did not exist. A team of scientists and engineers set about tackling the problem, removing long cylinders of ice, known as ice cores, from the sheet for study.
This article is coauthored with Jonathan Nelson. Millennials have been called the most entrepreneurial generation. While this may be true based on their desires to start businesses, millennials are not following through on their entrepreneurial dreams. A Bentley University survey of millennials found 66% of respondents have a desire to start their own business, 37% would like to work for themselves, and 25% would like to own their own company. Yet, as of 2013, only 3.6% of all businesses were owned by someone under the age of 30.
Conferences are an important part of a startup’s strategy. They’re where you meet new customers and potential partners, foster existing relationships, and raise brand awareness. However, events can be a huge drain on your financial and company resources, and it’s not always easy to decide which events you should focus your efforts on. So here are some guidelines to help startups with limited budgets determine when to attend, skip, or sponsor an event. Prior to deciding if your startup should participate in an event, it’s important to create a list of goals.
Real Madrid 3, VfL Wolfsburg 0 (Agg: 3-2): Zidane revels in best night of managerial career as Ronaldo treble stokes Champions League comeback | City A.M.
Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane shrugged off speculation about his job security and instead chose to revel in his side’s stunning second-leg comeback after a Cristiano Ronaldo treble broke the resistance of Wolfsburg. Former Manchester United forward Ronaldo wiped out the German outfit’s advantage with two strikes in the space of 86 first-half seconds before taking his Champions League tally to 93 goals in 125 appearances with a late clincher.
“May, death, lads, Shropshire’ was Virginia Woolf’s mocking resume of A Shropshire Lad, AE Housman’s melancholy-sweet 1896 poem cycle hymning the transient glory of male youth and hope. A similar word-cluster applies to this astonishingly assured debut from Joe White which is set in the heart of Shropshire during a Sunday in May and has much to do with the death of a young lad. No hint of curt dismissal should accompany such a summary, though – this is a warm, wise, sad, enthralling evening.
It's hard not to root for UFC world champion Ronda Rousey, but a cinematic promo for her next bout might just leave you undecided. Clocking in at nearly 3 minutes, "Revolution" from production firm Mothership follows the lifelong trajectories of both Rousey and her Nov. 14 challenger, Holly Holm. We see Rousey witness her first judo bout at age 11, while 16-year-old Holm gets her start with her first tentative shots at a punching bag. The tension—and the music—build as Rousey sharpens her judo chops and Holm becomes a boxing phenom, both slowly finding their calling.
In the months before John Lennon was tragically gunned down outside The Dakota in New York City on December 8, 1980, by deranged killer Mark David Chapman, life for the ex Beatle and his bride Yoko Ono was full of 'unclouded happiness'. And those moments, during the creation of what would be their last album together, are captured in the collection of photographs of the couple, published for the first time in the book, Double Fantasy. The photographs were taken by Kishin Shinoyama, who has now written about them in a book by him and Yoko Ono, published by Taschen Books in multiple international editions.
Two different worlds in the same town will be shown next month. Dover Film Festival will have documentaries of the town in 1978 and last year. This continues the present format of the annual festival showing two films exactly 40 years apart. The production 1978 Dover Film, directed by the late Ray Warner, includes the town carnival with Jackie Rix, Dover mayoress from 2016 yo 2018, as a carnival queen. She was then Miss Jackie Doble. It also shows one of that year's Channel swimmers, Saudi Arabian Prince Fahid, preparing for his challenge.
You might think your legs do all the work when it comes to your running routine, but that’s just not true. Your core muscles, which include your hips, abs, obliques and back, all work to keep you upright, balanced and moving. A strong core is particularly important for trail runners, who need to keep both their back and trunk limber as they maneuver over exposed tree roots and unstable ground while running. All runners can benefit from strong core muscles, as they keep your pelvis where it needs to be.
Few toys tap into a children’s wild imagination quite like the incredibly simple yet wildly ingenious plastic bricks known as Legos. Be it a replica of Han Solo’s Millennium Falcon or a bustling colorful brick city, there are few limits on what can be created with a set of Legos. Understanding the inspirational power native to these bricks, an Italian entrepreneur decided to dramatically up the building-block ante with a project called Edo. Essentially Legos on steroids — and made of cardboard — Edo blocks expand on the DIY spirit in a manner similar to their smaller plastic cousins while adding their own unique flair.
UISEONG, SOUTH KOREA—They arrived from all corners of Uiseong County. They brought homemade signs, waved flags and screamed for every shot. They came to celebrate four young women from this farming community who have emerged as the most unexpected (and most gloriously bespectacled) stars of the Winter Olympics. On Tuesday afternoon, townspeople gathered inside the gymnasium here at Uiseong Girls High School to root for the South Korean women’s curling team, whose match against the United States was shown on a big screen as an emcee leaned into a microphone and banged on a drum.

The Patriots are back in the Super Bowl, but here in the deepest-blue region of the country, the jubilation is tempered with anxiety. We are none of us confident of victory. The arrogant, haughty, overconfident Patriots fan of old, or at least the last decade, is an endangered species. They started disappearing en masse on February 3, 2008, when the Patriots’ high-flying 2007 season ended with a whimper in a shocking Super Bowl loss to the New York Giants, 17– 14. Every season since has led to further worry.
The Saudi-led military coalition fighting against the Houthi movement in Yemen said on Wednesday it would allow aid access through the port of Hodeidah and United Nations flights to Sanaa airport. The coalition closed all air, land and sea access to Yemen earlier this month following the interception of a missile fired toward the Saudi capital. It said it had to stem the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran, seen by Riyadh as the movement’s main backers. Aid agencies warned the move would worsen the humanitarian crisis in Yemen where the war has left an estimated seven million people facing famine.
Edward Gentry would readily exchange his life for that of his slain daughter, he told a Howard County jury pondering the fate of her killer yesterday. "My son is destroyed. My wife is destroyed. I'm destroyed," he said, choking back tears. "There's no joy in our house anymore." Mr. Gentry was testifying in the sentencing hearing of Darris A. Ware, who was convicted last week of killing his daughter, Betina Kristi Gentry, 18, and a friend, Cynthia Allen, 22, in the Gentrys' Severn home.
AMD boss Dirk 'Diggler' Mayer will be tightening his belt and struggling through the recession like the rest of us this year. Advanced Micro Devices' Alpha male will probably be forced to do his grocery shopping in Aldi for a while after it emerged that his 2009 payment package was slashed by 15 per cent compared to 2008. Diggler may not be able to have his Athlon-heeled boots shined quite so often this year, as his carry-home remuneration amounted to a paltry $4.5 million, rather than the $5.3 he trousered in 2008.
Awful Announcing has learned through multiple sources that Fox Sports 1 is making cuts to its news operation. The news updates that regularly air on Fox Sports 1 during commercial breaks will be folded into the At the Buzzer online brand and most significantly, some personnel at the newsdesk and producers will be let go. We’ve also learned that Fox Sports 1 is planning on cutting back on live reporting for events it doesn’t have the rights to air and pundits and reporters will be doing much less traveling as a part of these moves.

A Kenilworth barber has made great progress in a national competition to find the best wet-shave barber in the country. Yucel Olmezkaya, 46, who runs Groom and Gents Barbers in Station Road, will compete against other barbers in the West Midlands during the regional final of ‘Britain’s Best Shave’, to be held in March.

Krugle's home page is a simple search field, with buttons to search for code or "content" (documentation and other information). View Slideshow For most people, open source is a synonym for free software. But for programmers, open source is about sharing code, building on the work of others and not having to reinvent the wheel – at least, that's the ideal. In practice, code reuse remains very low, because it's often too hard for programmers to find relevant bits of code for their applications.

Courtney Jones, 11, has spent the last three months at Alder Hey children’s hospital in Liverpool. Her mum Melanie, 34, from Beaumaris, Anglesey, said: “They’ve said if a fifth tumour comes, it’s quite likely they will let it grow and that will be it then. “It’s a matter of time. It could come back in a year, five or seven years. We just don’t know. In September Courtney had her fourth tumour taken out. She now suffers Post-Fossa Syndrome which has affected her left side and speech.
‘To the Bone:’ Can you make a movie about eating disorders without glamorizing them? “To the Bone” doesn’t come out until July 14, but a trailer for the Netflix film — about a young woman’s struggle with anorexia nervosa — has already been getting mixed reviews. Part drama, part dark comedy, “To the Bone” stars Lily Collins as Ellen, a young woman who, after multiple stays in inpatient treatment programs, grudgingly agrees to live in a group home run by an unconventional doctor (Keanu Reeves).

A wide receiver signed to the practice squad usually doesn't get much notice. That's not the case for former Ohio State QB turned WR Braxton Miller. PHILADELPHIA – Perhaps the Eagles decided that they needed a wide receiver with a better arm for future "Philly Special" attempts. Of course, Eagles quarterback Nick Foles will have to run a lot farther, and faster, to catch those passes thrown by Braxton Miller, a former quarterback at Ohio State, where he was a two-time Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year before switching to wide receiver his senior year in 2015.

The recent incident on a United Airlines airplane, in which a passenger was forcibly removed from his seat and dragged out of an over-booked plane, has prompted a reaction from pretty much everyone on the internet. Now, a pair of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belts—brothers Rener and Ryron Gracie—have added their expertise to the mix, posting a video that shows you how to fight off an attacker trying to drag you somewhere by the legs. The video, while obviously satirical, actually shows real Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) moves which would most definitely work in real life.

Now what: The House Oversight and Reform Committee announced plans to subpoena a former White House official to investigate the security clearance practices. He tweeted: "Democrats, working with Republicans in Congress, can fix the Asylum and other loopholes quickly. We have a major National Emergency at our Border. GET IT DONE NOW!" "Trump previously sought to unilaterally change asylum laws by signing a proclamation to block some migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally from applying for asylum. Trump's effort was blocked by a court order. Trump regularly complains about U.S. immigration law.

Have you had your hearing checked? While a hearing test may not get the publicity that mammograms and colonoscopies do, the Mayo Clinic recommends a baseline hearing evaluation at age 50. After that, the Mayo experts say, you should have a regularly scheduled followup assessment depending on your needs. Gayla Poling, Ph.D., Audiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, spoke with the Mayo Clinic News Network about the issue. Poling said that if you do have hearing loss, your audiologist can talk with you about options for managing your condition.

You can get your cheek swabbed by the folks from Love Hope Strength to see if you’re a match to donate bone marrow and save someone’s life, as sixteen Linkin Park fans have already been. You’ll learn how you can help the environment from Reverb, a nonprofit that worked with Linkin Park’s crew to minimize the environmental impact caused by the tour.
Hanuman Jayanti is the pious day on which Sri Hanuman descended on earth in order to serve the purpose of his eternal master, Lord Ram. He, being an unalloyed devotee of Sri Ram is revered by all Ram bhakts. It is said in Srimad Bhagwatam (10.32.22) that the Lord is perpetually indebted to his devotees on account of their selfless service rendered by them to him. Even if he tries to repay them back, it would not be possible for him in the lifetime of one Brahma (some 311 trillion years).
The recession has continued to present both opportunities and problems for the Bryan County Board of Education. The board, hoping that business-hungry builders will offer bargain pricing, plans to receive bids for construction of the new Richmond Hill middle school Dec. 8. But the board, looking for ways to save money and spend more efficiently, also decided to slow progress on renovation of the old Black Creek elementary school. Architect Craig Buckley, addressing the Bryan Board of Education during its regular monthly meeting Oct. 22, said schools around Georgia were being built for about $135 per square foot one year ago.
My friend Scott Walker should not sign the power-grabbing legislation. The Wisconsin GOP’s lame-duck power play was not the death of democracy. But it was bad enough: petty, vindictive, and self-destructive. It was, as the saying goes, worse than a crime. It was a blunder. In its arrogant insularity, the Wisconsin GOP became a national symbol of win-at-all-costs, norms-be-damned politics. Cut through the overwrought rhetoric and what did the Republican legislators actually accomplish? Not really a whole lot; certainly not enough to justify the political damage they’ve inflicted on themselves.
A hang glider sails along the San Francisco coastline at Fort Funston, south of Ocean Beach along the Great Highway. What you see: The black sand, magnetite, is magnetic. The hang gliders are sensational. Beach walks go on forever. Along Ocean Beach to Fort Funston, about 750,000 people visit this stretch of San Francisco coast each year, according to national park statistics. Most are inspired by the expansive natural beauty and recreation. Ocean Beach and Funston are outstanding destinations for jogging, walking, dogs, fishing, hang gliding and surfing.
Embargoed to 2000 Thursday December 06 File photo dated 14/07/18 of broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough, who will delve back to one of his first natural history programmes, Zoo Quest, as he takes to the airwaves. Sir David Attenborough has called for a plan to tackle environmental problems with our actions now affecting the next few thousand years. The veteran broadcaster, 92, used an award acceptance speech at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, on Monday to urge business leaders and governments to come up with “practical solutions”.
Savannah Guthrie isn't taking any chances. The 'Today' anchor announced her pregnancy on Tuesday and said she won't travel to Rio for NBC's coverage of the Olympics because of concerns about Zika virus. The disease, which is spread by mosquitos, has afflicted large areas of South America and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where the games will be held this summer. Zika has been linked to severe birth defects and microcephaly -- abnormal brain development that causes a smaller than usual head size and intellectual disabilities. "I'm not gonna be able to go to Rio," Guthrie said.
Security firm iSIGHT Partners said in a blog post that it believes that the world’s first power outage caused by hackers in Ukraine two weeks ago may be the work of Russian group Sandworm Team. The company said the use of trojans from the BlackEnergy malware family as well as the KillDisk tool, found after investigating the attack on Ukrainian power authorities’ systems, are common in Sandworm Team’s attacks. Those findings, along with intelligence supplied by ‘sensitive sources’ point to the Russian cyberattack outfit. Reuters reports that Ukraine’s SBU state security service also believes Russia is to blame for the outage.
Just as you can love the Internet's ability to yield information--facts, even!--without understanding the behavior of electrons on the motherboard, you can love the sport of horse racing without understanding the art of handicapping. For me, it's about the horses, the singularly most beautiful running creatures God gave legs. It's about precisely conditioned athletes and the adrenaline junkies who ride them. It's about the colorful ritual that surrounds that most basic athletic pursuit, the foot race. For me, it's not about calculating odds and picking winners, which is suspiciously like advanced-placement math.

The replies were sought after a PIL was filed by NGO Removal of Corruption and Welfare Society. Even though Parliament has extended protection to unauthorised colonies of Delhi by amending the National Capital of Delhi (special provision) Act, the South municipal corporation on Wednesday told the High Court that “illegal” properties will not be allowed to be sold or rented. The counsel for South corporation told the High Court that the properties that had already been booked as “unauthorised” before the Act was passed, will be held in status quo.
PARIS – Airbus (search) is eager to launch an aircraft to rival Boeing Co.&apos;s (BA) efficient new 7E7 (search) passenger jet and hopes to make an announcement by the end of the year, the European planemaker said on Tuesday. Airbus is studying the idea of developing the new A350 (search) as a long-range version of its wide-body A330 (search), Airbus marketing chief John Leahy told reporters. "We are looking at the A350 (after) airlines asked if we could build an A330 that flies longer," Leahy said.
GUCHENG, China — They were the first photos Marip Lu had ever taken of her son, and it broke her heart to think they might be the last. The 3-year-old was standing in their living room in rural China, brown eyes beaming as he watched cartoons on TV. He had no idea she was facing a heart-wrenching choice: stay with him and the family that was holding her hostage, or leave him behind and be free. Six years earlier, Marip Lu said, she had been drugged, kidnapped and trafficked to this place far from her native Myanmar.

I know what some of you are thinking, didn’t a Donnie Darko sequel already happen? Yes, it did. It was called S. Darko, and Donnie Darko writer-director Richard Kelly and Darko Entertainment publicly denounced it . Kelly had no control over the rights of the original film, so the sequel moved forward without his approval. The director and his producing partners didn’t even profit from the straight-to-DVD cash grab. Kelly is now interested in a real Donnie Darko sequel, or some “big and expensive” movie set in the Darkoverse, if you will.
Nobody should get complacent, but there is hope that the city could be starting to reverse its climbing rates of violence. After years of grim headlines and shocking statistics, there is finally a glimmer of good news in Wilmington's fight against crime. As of Monday, shootings are down 61 percent and homicides are down 63 percent from the same period last year. Compared to 2008, shootings are down 35 percent. Delaware's largest city desperately needed this improvement. Shootings and killings have steadily grown more frequent, and 2017 was Wilmington's worst-ever year of gun violence.

Danube Properties, a Dubai-based property developer, has revealed that it sold new homes worth AED820 million ($233 million) in 2017. This translates to a daily average sale of AED3.10 million and reflects the developer’s ability to sell homes despite tough market conditions, the developer said in a statement.

July 10, Kerry Caldwell of The Edge Brewing Co. in Boise sustained burns over almost 30 percent of her body in a boil-over accident. The next day she was transported to the Burn Center at the University of Utah, where she continues to receive treatment, and is expected to make a full recovery, according to a post on the Edge Brewing Facebook page. Boise's beer community being tight knit, a group of local brewers is throwing a fundraiser to benefit Caldwell's recovery at PreFunk-Boise Saturday, July 18, beginning at 3 p.m.
Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is right about one thing. Our national parks may be the last of the true bargains. They were never intended to be a money-making proposition, and should not be converted into one. Zinke has suggested fees charged to enter some parks should be increased substantially. New funding is needed to address the National Park Service’s $11 billion maintenance backlog, he explains. In testimony before a congressional committee, Zinke noted that an annual pass allowing admittance to all parks costs just $80 a year. Senior citizens can get lifetime passes for that much.
LAS VEGAS—The father of NBA rookie Shabazz Muhammad was sentenced to more than three years in federal prison and ordered to repay almost $1.7 million in restitution after pleading guilty in a Las Vegas mortgage fraud case. Ronald Holmes apologized Thursday before Senior U.S. District Judge Larry Hicks sentenced him in Las Vegas to 37 months in prison and five years of supervised release. Holmes is due to surrender May 30 to begin his sentence. His defense attorney, Michael Lippman, says Holmes looks forward to putting the case behind him. Holmes pleaded guilty in December to felony conspiracy to commit mail, wire and bank fraud.
I would like to update the citizens of Craig about the status of the American Legion. The Legion purchased the Shadow Mountain Clubhouse in 2010 for $250,000, with a one-year note. In February 2011, the Legion asked the Moffat County Board of County Commissioners for a five-year extension, which was granted. In February 2016, we (the Legion) were unable to come up with the money, so I asked the commissioners for another five-year extension. I was denied. Prior to asking for the extension, a new group was forming, and they were going to get a grant to buy the building.
Peterborough police are warning about a scam in which a person claims to be a bishop requesting iTunes gift cards. Peterborough police are warning the public about a new scam involving fake priests targeting parishioners for electronic gift cards. Police say last Friday a victim received an email from someone claiming to be a local priest who requested $400 in iTunes gift cards for a friend battling cancer at the hospital. The email also requests that the person photograph the numbers on the purchased gift card and send the image back. Police say the email scam appears to be targeting Catholic parishioners locally and across Canada.
Police say an unknown suspect in a black Lincoln Navigator shot an 18-year-old once in the chest near Route 13 Alternate and Virginia Avenue. An 18-year-old was shot in the chest by an unknown suspect in a black Lincoln Navigator early Wednesday morning, police said.

May speech: Last ditch attempt to improve position before business end of talks begins. So here we are again. Another Brexit speech from the prime minister, another inch further down the road to nowhere. Her glacial transformation from fairy tale to economic disaster continues. Watching her over the last 18 months has been like seeing a children's animation turn into a bleak kitchen sink drama. She began with gusto and passion, promising that Britain could have all the trade it wanted - "the exact same benefits", to use David Davis' phrase, outside the single market and customs union as inside.
There's a lot of talk about officials that move between government agencies and the law firms that work for the industries those agencies regulate, but that talk rarely includes details. Now the details are here. Thanks to a Freedom of Information Act Request filed by Bloomberg Businessweek, we get an inside look at the relationship between senior SEC regulators and a former commissioner turned Wall Street lawyer named Annette Nazareth. All of the e-mails were written between February 2009 and May 2011, while Dodd-Frank legislation was being written and the Consumer Financial Protection Board was being formed.
Not very long ago, British Prime Minister David Cameron used an international forum in mid-November this year, the Commonwealth Heads of State Summit, in the South Asian nation Sri Lanka, to project himself and British regime he is heading as the paragon of virtue of media freedom among other sacred rights. The 23rd Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) has been held in the capital city of Colombo, Sri Lanka, from 15th – 17th November 2013. The last CHOGM was held in 2011 in Perth, Australia and the first ever CHOGM was held in 1971 in Singapore.
The more I read about blockchain and the more I talk to the CIOs, CTOs, developers, and tech-savvy executives I call early adopters, the clearer it is that everyone will need to make sense of blockchain for their organization. In the biggest sense, blockchain is a proxy for the genuine excitement about applications and platforms that cross company boundaries and support vast ecosystems. Let’s call these collaborative ecosystem applications platforms. Marshall Van Alstyne explained the logic of these platforms in his book Platform Revolution. We should all be excited about such applications.
Crossrail, the scheme to build main line rail tunnels under Central London, has edged closer to reality after the City of London Corporation has promised £250m towards the £16bn construction bill. The new east-west underground train link would improve the transport connections to Heathrow airport, linking Paddington and Liverpool Street stations and providing an alternative to the Central and Piccadilly Underground lines. It is scheduled to open in 2017 and will carry 200m passengers a year. Although the deal is worth up to £350m, £100m will be in the form of voluntary contributions that have yet to be agreed with the 150 biggest companies in the City.
The way state government spends taxpayers’ money in the next fiscal year has been laid out. But financing for future years remains uncertain during a fragile and recovering economy. Senate appropriations chairman Kurt Schaefer says state government is on financially-reduced but stable footing heading into a fiscal year starting July first. But in a few months Schaefer and other budget-making lawmakers will be starting work on a new budget that will be missing federal stimulus funds that have propped up state programs for a couple of years. He expects state income to continue slow growth but he expects demands on that limited income to increase.
PORT ELIZABETH - ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa launched the ANC’s political school named after struggle stalwart, Oliver Reginald Tambo, at an event held at Gallagher Estate in Midrand on Thursday. In honouring the memory of the late leader of the organisation, the OR Tambo School of Leadership said in a statement that it would embrace the values of humanity, selflessness and foresight that underpinned his revolutionary leadership.

He was renowned for his fair, inclusive and embracing leadership.
Microsoft has adopted Git to manage the vast collection of code that is Windows' source, and has shared performance issues it's had to fix along the way. The state-of-the-nation report for what Microsoft calls the “largest Git repo on the planet” follows on from its launch of the “fat Git repo” handler, the Git Virtual File System, as the foundation of its planned shift. Redmond's certainly feeling pleased with itself about the move, in particular stroking itself about being able to move the whole 2,000-strong Windows OneCore team from the Source Depot internal tool to Git over a weekend.
Carlos Slim is the king of Business Bros and CEOs for the fourth time in a row—unseating Bill Gates and the Microsoft machine in 2010 with his Mexican Telecom Empire. Carlos Slim is settling into a somewhat traditional position on the Forbes list, this being his fourth year, however turnover happens and it happens fast. One time Big 3 winner Warren Buffet has been bumped down to a still-incredibly-enviable fourth place, by Zara owner Amancio Ortega, proving the global obsession with endless basics is still incredibly acute. Carlos Slim is worth $73 billion, and has a good lead in the game.
The son of former Punjab Vidhan Sabha speaker Nirmal Singh Kahlon has trounced the daughter-in-law of education minister Sikander Singh Maluka in the initial administrative battle of getting into the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) through the nomination route. The screening committee led by chief secretary Rakesh Singh has selected Amritsar district health officer Dr Shiv Karan Singh Kahlon as one of the five candidates for the single IAS post to be filled up through the nomination route, while another heavyweight, additional director general of school education (DGSE) Parampal Kaur, daughter-in-law of education minister Sikander Singh Maluka, has lost the race, say sources in the government.
Federico García Lorca, Spain’s most renowned poet and dramatist, in 1935. He was shot a year later by a Nationalist firing squad. In the Andalusian city of Granada, a little road leads uphill, past the forested ramparts of the Alhambra, to a cemetery. The earth there is a deep, raw red, and the olive trees that punctuate it are green and gray and very old. The cemetery wall is high and long, the same color as the earth, and it is crowned with rough clay tiles.
The 18th Annual Wichita Adult Literacy Council Book Fair offers low-priced books in more than 40 categories. It takes a lot of volunteers and support from the community to gather, store, transport and organize an event like the Wichita Adult Literacy Council's 18th Annual Book Fair. This year's event includes approximately 100,000 books in 48 categories, according to WALC Book Room Manager Franklin Bush, who, along with several volunteers were busily sorting and organizing the donated books Wednesday at the Midwestern State University Sikes Lake Center. The Sneak Preview costs $10 and goes from 5-8 p.m. Thursday evening.
This week should accelerate Garoppolo’s learning curve. Even though he’s been here a month, quality practice snaps are hard to get in the middle of a season. Wednesday’s practice was the first time Garoppolo has worked with San Francisco’s first-team offense from start to finish. He’s thrown to starters such as receiver Marquise Goodwin and tight end George Kittle over the last month, but the vast majority of those passes have come during warm-ups, not in the context of Shanahan’s offense and not with anyone playing defense against them.
I would first like to take the opportunity to publicly thank David Johnson for bringing my voting record to my attention. I have corrected the issue. Please feel free to check again. Oh, and the years before 2008 I was in Columbiana County. Please use the correct citation to check my voting history. ( https://trumbull.oh-vote.org/VoterView/RegistrantSearch.do ) I would like to continue to address Mr. Johnson’s assumptions and errors. When Mr. Johnson and I were first introduced, I was a clerk at the local Dairy Mart on East State Street in Salem.

We can’t wait until 2016 to set the agenda.
Gaza is a coastal strip of land that lay on ancient trading and maritime routes along the Mediterranean shore. Held by the Ottoman Empire until 1917, it passed from British to Egyptian to Israeli military rule over the last century and is now a fenced-in enclave inhabited by two million Palestinians. Tens of thousands of Palestinians took refuge in Gaza after fleeing or being driven from their homes. The invading Egyptian army had seized a narrow coastal strip 25 miles (40 km) long from the Sinai to just south of Ashkelon. The influx of refugees saw Gaza's population triple to around 200,000.
Exactly one year ago, the Mavericks played in Portland and during the second half, Wesley Matthews pulled up in the backcourt after nothing more than a routine move and later found out he had a ruptured Achilles tendon. His recovery has been nothing short of remarkable. He was back in time to play at the start of the season, which nobody seriously expected. He also has been an improving player. While he had to drag his leg around at times early in the season, he's been much sharper in the last month and recent games have proven that he's very close to being 100 percent.
Ladies and gentleman, may we introduce Dax Shepard, feature film writer/director. The star of Idiocracy and Zathura has written and co-directed Brother’s Justice, a mockumentary in which he also stars as himself, shopping around a movie pitch in which he’ll play a martial arts action star. Featuring Tom Arnold, Jon Favreau, Ashton Kutcher and Bradley Cooper, the film is currently on the festival circuit and seeking distribution. Check out the trailer after the jump. As a fan of films filled with inside Hollywood jokes, I think Brother’s Justice certainly has potential.
Is Wunderbrow any good? And how does it work? Good eyebrows are a God send. And trying to get good eyebrows is a ridiculously difficult skill, but is certainly made easier with Wunderbrow. It's the latest beauty trend sweeping the nation and works as a gel that you brush through your eyebrows, filling any gaps. You then brush the formula through your eyebrows, letting it work it's magic. Inside the packet you get a small pot of gel and an eyebrow brush. The results are pretty drastic and can be seen in the photo below from Melrae Segal's YouTube review.
For the second time so far this year, marijuana legislation in Congress has been officially designated with the bill number 420. It seems to be an obvious nod to the increasingly mainstream cannabis culture from lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Sen. Ron Wyden's (D-OR) proposal, S.420, would deschedule marijuana by removing it from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), establish a federal excise tax on legal sales and create a system of permits for businesses to engage in cannabis commerce. Marijuana enthusiasts, of course, celebrate their favorite plant on April 20, also known as 4/20.
Trade-offs apply to our economic lives, as well as our political lives. That means getting more of one thing requires giving up something else. Let's look at some examples. Black congressmen and black public officials in general, including Barack Obama, always side with teachers unions in their opposition to educational vouchers, tuition tax credits, charter schools and other measures that would allow black parents to take their children out of failing public schools. Most black politicians and many black professionals take the position of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is on record as saying, "We shouldn't abandon the public schools."

Shares of graphics chip company NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) rocketed 224% higher in 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Impressive growth in all of its major businesses -- including gaming, data center, and automotive -- in addition to optimistic growth expectations led investors to pile into the stock throughout 2016.

Recent allegations of sexual abuse and cover-up within a well known international ministry and subsequent public statements by several evangelical leaders have angered and distressed many, both inside and outside of the Church. These events expose the troubling reality that, far too often, the Church’s instincts are no different than from those of many other institutions, responding to such allegations by moving to protect her structures rather than her children. This is a longstanding problem in the Christian world, and we are deeply grieved by the failures of the American and global Church in responding to the issue of sexual abuse.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an "informal investigation" into the $130.6 million dollars worth of stock sold by Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo in the first six months of 2007, reports the Wall Street Journal. Mozilo's stock sales were supposedly "preset" by his "executive sales plan" -- a scheme designed to protect executives from charges of insider trading, but, report the Journal's Kara Scanell and James R. Hagerty, "earlier this year, the SEC said it is taking a hard look at these plans following an academic study that found that insiders were starting these plans just ahead of big stock drops.
DOVER, Del. - Greg Biffle put everything he had Friday into one qualifying lap for the Best Buy 400. Although NASCAR allowed two laps around the one-mile concrete oval, Biffle was still haunted by a spin during his second lap a year ago. However, after running 155.219 mph, he didn't need more than one lap. Biffle easily won the pole for Sunday's race, saying his plan all along was to channel his attention into a single lap. "It does take a lot of nerve, but when these guys give me cars like this it makes it easy on me," Biffle said.
The White House has issued a steady stream of commentary about how the U.S. economy is the best ever (not true) and how we have finally turned the corner from the slow growth of the Obama years (also not true). Sound analysis is often drowned out by political noise and ideological bias. The best way through the noise and bias is to look at hard data. The economy has been growing since June 2009, making this the third-longest economic expansion on record. However, it has also been the weakest economic expansion on record. That has not changed under President Trump.

Joe Calzaghe has relinquished the IBF World Super Middleweight championship he won with his career-best victory over American Jeff Lacy in March. The Welshman has chosen to fight American TV boxing reality show star Peter Manfredo Jnr rather than face his IBF mandatory challenger Robert Stieglitz. The sanctioning body had applied pressure on Calzaghe by putting the fight out to purse offers but Manfredo, a household name in America after his appearances on 'The Contender' television series, is a more lucrative option. in front of an anticipated 30,000 crowd at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on Saturday, March 3.

The London MC has smashed 2018 into pieces, releasing a string of vital cuts that underline her claim to be one of the country's most innately gifted rap artists.

Roasted coffee is seen inside the new Starbucks Reserve Roastery flagship in downtown Milan, Italy, September 4, 2018. MILAN (Reuters) - Italian consumer group Codacons has filed a complaint with the national competition watchdog accusing Starbucks of overcharging customers at its first cafeteria in the country. The world's biggest coffee chain is making its first foray into the home of espresso coffee by opening an upmarket roastery in a central Milan square. Customers walking into the converted post office now housing the lavishly decorated cafe will pay 1.80 euros ($2.09) for an espresso, almost twice the normal market price.
Ammonite, an open source tool to use the Scala language for scripting, should debut in its Version 1.0 production version in next two months. The two-year-old project lets Scala be used for small scripts. It offers an interactive REPL (read-eval-print loop) and system shell capabilities. The project also can be used as a library in existing Scala projects, via the Ammonite-Ops file system library. "Scala has traditionally been a heavy, powerful language with heavy, powerful tools. Ammonite aims to let you use it for small, simple tasks as well,” said Ammonite developer Li Haoyi, a former engineer at Fluent Systems.
Sliema registered their eleventh win of the season after beating Ħamrun Spartans 3-2. The Wanderers forged ahead after twenty-one minutes. Matias Muchardi saw his shot from a free-kick going past Sultana. Ħamrun hit back immediately and equalised four minutes later. Following a mistake by Glenn Zammit, Arthur Faria Machedo placed the ball inside the net from outside the penalty area. The Spartans went ahead for the first time in the match on the 27th minute. In his attempts to clear Lydon Micallef’s cross, Kurt Shaw finished past his own goalkeeper. Sliema scored the equalising goal three minutes into the second half.
Two senior Fianna Fáil TDs have said they have "no doubt" the party's hierarchy will consider running Billy Kelleher in the imminent European elections despite his failure to be selected by grassroots members. Thomas Byrne and Fiona O'Loughlin said they believe officials will be "looking" at adding Mr Kelleher or female candidates in the coming days - despite insisting the decision is entirely in headquarters' hands. On Saturday, long-standing Cork TD Mr Kelleher lost out by just eight votes to Wexford councillor Malcolm Byrne in his bid to be selected as Fianna Fáil's Ireland South candidate in the European elections.

CAIRO – Clashes between rival Libyan militias fighting for control of the international airport in the capital, Tripoli, have killed 47 people over the last week, Libya&apos;s Health Ministry said. The ministry said on its website late Sunday that the fighting also left 120 people wounded. It also said it had not yet received the full casualty report. The weeklong battle over the airport is being waged by a powerful militia from the western city of Zintan, which controls the facility, and Islamist-led militias, including fighters from Misrata, east of Tripoli.
A pair of speculative developers, a philanthropist and one of Hollywood's biggest tickets were among those closing deals in L.A. County's high-end real estate market in late October and early November. After selling a $100-million spec house to Tom Gores, developers Gala Asher and Ed Berman may have found their next project. Through a limited liability company, the pair bought a French chateau-inspired home in the 2000 block of Wallingford Drive for $2.9 million less than the asking price. Sitting on more than five acres, the estate centers on a 22,163-square-foot home with seven bedrooms and 15 bathrooms.
The death of Border Patrol Agent Rogelio Martinez near Van Horn late last year was a heartbreaking tragedy, but there is no evidence it was an assault. That’s the conclusion of the FBI following an exhaustive investigation. Such a finding does not make the loss any easier for Martinez’s loved ones, nor does it diminish the dangers or challenges of working along some parts of the U.S.-Mexico border. The terrain can be brutally rugged, and agents work in isolation covering remote areas used by traffickers. But it is a reminder the best judgments are not rushed.
JUBILANT sailors are celebrating the triumphant climax of the world’s longest and most gruelling ocean adventure. Thousands lined the banks of the River Thames in London to welcome home crews from the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race. Hampshire sailors were among the 250 amateur sailors receiving a hero’s welcome at the grand finale of the epic nautical adventure which has taken them 40,000 nautical mile circumnavigation around the globe. Over the last 11 months the 12 competing vessels have faces everything from violent tropical storms, to savage 90-mph winds, freezing nights and scorching heats over six continents.
It appears that pro-life groups in America such as the Pro-Life Action League, view Ireland as the “last bastion of an abortion-free Europe,” according to Irish writer Angela Nagle, in her piece for The Atlantic. After it was long assumed that pro-life groups in Ireland received American money for their funding, the American Pro-Life Action League's spokesperson Joseph Scheidler confirmed the notion in a recent interview with the Sunday Business Post. Scheidler was quoted as saying in his Sunday Business Post interview that "They [Irish pro-life groups] need the money for publicity.
Dangerous driving conditions could affect drivers this weekend and snow plow drivers have some words of wisdom for commuters. ROCHESTER, Minn. -- A Winter Storm is being issued for 11 counties in Southeast Minnesota and snow plow drivers are warning drivers about how to commute safely. Kyle Decker is the owner of Kyle's Lawn Service and is going out with 4 other drivers to clean out residential lots and driveways. In fact, he is still getting calls about it. "It sounds like it's going to be wet snow, heavy," Decker said. He is preparing to work overtime.
Panel discussions and events continue to take place in support for Omid Kokabee, the UT physics graduate student who many are saying was unjustly sentenced to ten years in prison in Iran. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology panel discussion took place Thursday to alert the academic community about Kokabee‘s situation. Eugene Chudnovsky, co-chair on the Committee of Concerned Scientists, spoke along with Kamiar and Arash Alaei, two brothers charged in Iran in 2008 for communicating with enemy governments and sentenced to prison. Like Kokabee, the brothers pleaded innocent at their trial.
ANOTHER Ipswich Turf Club race meeting was lost last week as the scheduled Metropolitan Wednesday program was transferred in its entirety to the BRC track Doomben. While stakeholders were disaffected due to the early transfer on the day prior, the reputation of Racing Queensland and the ITC took another battering. It was the third time in a month that an Ipswich race meeting was affected by postponement, abandonment due to rainfall, or transfer to another track. The abandoned Friday meeting two weeks ago was simply due to the lack of drainage that is the Ipswich racetrack.
In their victory speeches, Vice President Cheney and President Bush claimed a "mandate," "historic victory," and that "America has spoken." Pundits have declared that the election was about "moral values." Americans in the red states voted against homosexual marriage and abortion. Let's hope that this is correct. Otherwise, America is doomed if Bush's reelection is based on his economic and foreign policy record. Can you imagine our peril if Bush's mandate is for unprecedented trade and budget deficits and job loss? Or for taking the country to war based on incompetence or deception?
Combined company will make Chevron second-largest petroleum producer in the world. The combined company will remain far behind Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. in market capitalization, but Chevron will jump from being the world's fourth biggest energy producer, to second, according to Wood Mackenzie. The cash-and-stock deal announced Friday comes as U.S. crude prices have shot up 40% this year. Chevron gets access to Anadarko's liquid natural gas operations in Mozambique and it would control a 75-mile-wide corridor across the Delaware Basin, a region bountiful with natural gas. Oil prices have been on the rise as OPEC members cut production.
A Rhode Island man who has been convicted of drunken driving nine times in jurisdictions across the country, pleaded not guilty this morning in New Bedford District Court to his 10th offense, State Police said. Trooper Fernando Dasilva found Brant while responding to a call for a motor vehicle crash on Interstate 195 in New Bedford at around 8 p.m. Saturday. Brant was walking around a Toyota Corolla that appeared to have veered off the road and crashed into some trees, State Police said. Dasilva suspected Brant was intoxicated and arrested him. Brant declined medical attention and refused a Breathalyzer test, State Police said.
Sci-Fi fans will rejoice with today’s news as details about the upcoming game, Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock which was first announced last month, have been revealed in a trailer that was released by BBC Worldwide today. The main revelation was the fact that the game will be a 2D platform, but don’t let that put you off. In the past the video game world has only left fans of the famous sci-fi series disappointed as it has failed to deliver a game worthy of being a big hit as the series has been for decades.
Data journalism works best when there's a lot of data to work with. Wikileaks' Iraq war logs release has dumped some 391,000 records of the Iraq war into the public arena. We've had them for a few weeks - what have we found out? This is in a different league to the Wikileaks Afghanistan leak - there's a good case for saying the new release has made the war the most documented in history. Every minor detail is now there for us to analyse and breakdown but one factor stands out: the sheer volume of deaths, most of which are civilians.
The opposition SNP group are demanding free parking in Kirriemuir, Brechin and Carnoustie, where they say the charges have brought “devastating effects on the fragile town centres”. Other proposals include a report on installing parking meters which accept cash in some parts of Forfar, Arbroath and Montrose, where smaller, peripheral car parks would be free. The group also want to see all short-stay car parks extended from two hours to four hours – a prospect already raised by Montrose and District Independent councillor Mark Salmond. SNP group leader Lynne Devine.
*The winners of the “48th NAACP Image Awards” were announced tonight during the live broadcast from Pasadena Civic Auditorium which aired on TV One. The two-hour live special was hosted by Anthony Anderson. There was a live pre-show from the red carpet hosted by Nischelle Turner and Terrence Jenkins including Tai Beauchamp and Chris Spencer as special correspondents. NAACP Chairwoman Roslyn Brock presented the NAACP Chairman’s Award to Harvard Law Professor Charles J. Ogletree, Jr. NAACP President Cornell William Brooks presented the NAACP President’s Award to Lonnie G. Bunch, III.
Over the past two weeks, we have been laying some groundwork on the need to empty our hearts of offense and unforgiveness. And while some people may go through life looking for reasons to get angry and offended, most of us would prefer a life devoid of these feelings. But how do we do that in a world that is insensitive on a good day and downright cruel on the next? We have a couple of options here. The world's way is to avoid people and self-protect. God's way, however, is far more effective.
Mysuru and Kodagu MP Prathap Simha said, efforts will be made to established the IIT, sanctioned in the current Union Budget, in Mysuru to mark the centenary of the UoM and also that of the late chief minister D Devaraja Urs and the campus would be named after Urs. He was addressing a media conference, here, on Tuesday, after listing out the achievements of the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, to mark its completion of one year in office. He sought the support of Chief Minister Siddaramiah for the establishment of the IIT in Mysuru.
In days gone by, when our economy was dominated by agriculture and manufacturing, an employee’s value was gauged by their inputs into the company. If they slacked off by not placing a bumper on a car fast enough, they were unproductive. And if they slept on the job, they were stealing time from their employers and could be fired. Today, however, we live in what is largely a knowledge economy in which an employee’s value is based on their outputs, not their inputs. This means their performance is often more about ultimate results and less about the hours clocked.
Jason Ritter went to a dark place on The Long Road Home. In the eight-part National Geographic series, based on Martha Raddatz’s best-selling 2007 book, Ritter plays real-life commander Troy Denomy, who, along with his comrades, came under surprise attack in Sadr City, Iraq, on April 4, 2004, now known as Black Sunday. The series doesn’t just detail the soldiers’ lives in the harrowing moments during and after the attack, but also peels back the curtain on the stressful hours their family members thousands of miles away endured not knowing if their loved ones were OK.
I'm sure there are worse things in life than encountering "the Wall" on a golf course, but at the moment I'm drawing a blank. For those unaware of "the Wall," it's that painfully slow group ahead impeding your round. It's usually not intentional, yet the sight -- and subsequent stoppage -- of "the Wall" is an emotional dagger, on par with your family dog dying in front of your eyes moments after your wife leaves you for the tennis instructor. (Slight exaggeration.)
Highstrung, overachiever, neat freak? NEVER. The term Type A was coined when cardiologist Meyer Friedman discovered a connection between heart disease and personality type — mainly that individuals who were most likely to have a cardiac event also tended to have more driven impatient, high-stress personalities. Type A Behavior (TAB) has become a way of speaking about a loose set of characteristics related to highly competitive people. People with Type A personalities tend to be very competitive, self-critical multitaskers. They never do just one thing at a time. If they're watching TV, they're also folding laundry.
Missouri football pulled out a 28–24 win against Arkansas for Senior Day. For the Battle Line rivalry matchup and Senior Day, the Tigers brought home a win against the Arkansas Razorbacks on Nov. 25. An unranked Arkansas came in with a 7-5 record and bowl game prospects, while Missouri, with only three wins to its name, knew this would be the final match of the season. Though Arkansas was first to score, Missouri was quick to tie up the game. The Razorbacks went on to finish the half with a 28–7 lead.

Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed statements from Eron Brainard to Michael Carter. Chairman of the Fire and Police Civil Service Board asked for immediate removal of the interim chief of the Shreveport Police Department for abuse of power. The Civil Service Board sent public notice of a special meeting Monday with chairman Michael Carter's request that Ben Raymond be removed as provisional chief of police. Raymond recently ordered Carter, an SPD Sergeant, be transferred from patrol to human resources. Carter is asking the board to cancel that order. An agenda item said the transfer was retaliatory.
JC Penney, Applied Materials Visit Friday’s 52-Week Low Club - 24/7 Wall St.
August 17, 2018: Here are four stocks trading with heavy volume among 110 equities making new 52-week lows in Friday’s session.

Delegates at the provincial general council had cast their votes for the ANC's top six in a secret ballot, and counting began just before 5am on Thursday. It appears some of the disputes from ANC members – who claimed the selection of delegates was done fraudulently – were still underway. On Wednesday night, a brief fracas erupted outside the Cape Peninsula University of Technology hall where the council was being held. A group of members from ANC branches in the Boland region demanded access to the council to settle disputes about the selection of branch delegates.
Sprint superstar Usain Bolt will seek a final golden hurrah when he takes to the track at the IAAF World Championships in London this week. Bolt has dominated sprinting since taking double individual gold at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, going on to win a further six Olympic golds and also picking up 11 world titles. World records of 9.58 and 19.19sec in the 100 and 200m when winning in the 2009 Berlin worlds were followed by the towering Jamaican winning consecutive world golds in the 100, 200 and 4x100m relay in 2011, 2013 and 2015, with the exception of a false start in the 100m in Daegu in 2011.
The justice secretary had admitted this morning that he was giving "further consideration" to the case for public interest after reports over the weekend suggested reasons for the move. Venables, 27, was ten years old when he murdered toddler James Bulger in 1993. After being released the Ministry of Justice confirmed he was returned to jail following a "breach of licence conditions" on Wednesday. James' mother Denise Fergus said she had a "right to know" why the recall had taken place. But this afternoon Mr Straw told the Commons that it would not be in the public interest to make further revelations.
Trilobites are the arch-iconic Cambrian animal, having burst onto the scene without known ancestors along with the other Cambrian phyla, equipped and ready to explore the world with those sophisticated compound eyes that “evolution” generously invented. The mystery of how animals “burst onto the scene” in such a marvelous fashion is the question with which Stephen Meyer begins his investigation in Darwin’s Doubt. As Dr. Meyer argues, sudden appearances and explosive events in the fossil record are an enigma that bedeviled Darwin in his day, still disturbs the sleep of evolutionists, and forms an initial observation in the case for intelligent design.
People living in Ghana’s mining communities may now be better protected from deadly mercury poisoning. On March 23, Ghana ratified the Minamata Convention on Mercury – a real step forward for communities affected by mercury pollution. Mercury, a toxic liquid metal, is used in small-scale gold mines all over the world to separate the gold from the ore, and then released into air and water. Ghana is one of Africa’s top gold producers, and about a million people work in its small gold mines. Workers and nearby communities are directly exposed to mercury.
He serves on board at Technical College of the Lowcountry and Beaufort-Jasper Academy for Career Excellence. He was a past member of the town's Redevelopment Commission, the Beaufort Regional Chamber of Commerce's board of directors and the city of Beaufort's Design Review Board. In preparation for a possible council run, he spoke with town manager Van Willis and council members about what the job entailed. He talked with mentors, his dad and his boss at The Greenery, where Ashmore is the director of workforce development. Ashmore interpreted the positive responses as a green light.
The Obama administration’s ambitious long-term health study, dubbed the Precision Medicine Initiative, has tapped the Mayo Clinic to build a repository for biological samples collected from the study’s participants. Through the National Institutes of Health, the administration has awarded $142 million over five years to the Rochester, MN-based Mayo Clinic for the so-called “biobank,” which is meant eventually to house more than 35 million blood samples, tissue specimens, and more. “It’s not meant to be an archive,” said NIH deputy director Kathy Hudson (pictured).
The Wharf has been a success in its first year, and there are a lot of ways to get there without using your car, but the rapid density change has made getting around the old-fashioned way a little more difficult. The development’s success has come at a cost to some drivers confounded by traffic backups and parking problems. WASHINGTON — One year ago, a sleepy corner of Southwest D.C. suddenly blossomed into a beehive of social activity. Now, business is booming at the District Wharf, a year after the 24-acre development’s grand opening.
When we think of a movie about closed-in people, instinct often goes to a Virginia Woolf-like figure -- a lonely person languorous in a walled room. John Cameron Mitchell’s Rabbit Hole is about closed-in people, but he chooses to begin his film in the open space of a yard, somewhat like the similar first shot of Carolyn Burnham in American Beauty. With Rabbit Hole, we meet the neighbors, we see what kind of lives our protagonists, Becca and Howie, should be leading. Then, we see them hiding in a house to avoid a neighborhood grill-out.
A regular bus user has expressed safety concerns following work to erect four new shelters on Rutherglen Main Street. Dave Clark also accused First Group of leaving passengers in the dark by failing to post timetables on the newly installed bus shelters. Dave, of Cambuslang, says pavements were dug up during work to erect the new shelters around the Rutherglen Exchange shopping centre and the Mecca bingo hall. But he said the uneven surface made it dangerous to passengers boarding and disembarking from buses. Retired IT consultant Dave, who regularly uses the bus service, said the new shelters had display boards – which contained no timetables whatsoever.
Future space missions may send dozens of rug-like robots fluttering down to the surface of alien worlds, taking much of the risk out of planetary exploration. Researchers are developing flat, blanket-size landers that could be delivered en masse to worlds such as Mars or the Jupiter moon Europa. The approach represents a radical departure from the surface-exploration status quo, which generally launches single-shot, big-ticket landers or rovers that cost hundreds of millions of dollars to design and build. Hemmati and his team got a $100,000 grant from NIAC last year to develop the "flat lander" concept.
The president's case for citizens to go to the polls remains potent 50 years later. The Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas recently unearthed this fantastic, rarely seen public service announcement taped by President John F. Kennedy on October 31, 1962. It was a tense time: The Cuban Missile Crisis had officially ended just three days earlier, and the nation was still on edge about the prospect of nuclear apocalypse. In that atmosphere, Kennedy filmed this ad. In these tense and anxious weeks, I know that every American citizen wants to know what we can do for his country.
Amy Lynn Thornburg and Timothy Lee Myers were united in marriage on June 16 at the Marshall County Courthouse with Judge David Hummel officiating.

Attendants included Owen and Gavin Myers, sons of the groom. A reception will take place on a date to be determined. The bride is a 1999 graduate of John Marshall High School and is employed by Wheeling Hospital as a laboratory clerk.
(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected a request by President Donald Trump’s administration to halt a trial set to begin on Monday that will test the legality of the government’s contentious decision to ask people taking part in the 2020 national census whether they are citizens. The justices announced the action in a one-sentence order. Three conservative justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch - said they would have granted the request for an indefinite postponement of the trial. Trump’s new appointee to the nine-member court, Brett Kavanaugh, did not state publicly how he voted on the matter.
At least 19 people, mostly children, killed when rains swept away a group of teachers and students touring the Dead Sea. At least 19 people, mostly children, were killed when torrential rains swept away a bus carrying students and teachers touring near the Dead Sea, according to sources in the country's civil defence directorate. The director general of the kingdom's Civil Defence, Mustafa al-Basaiah, said on Friday that 13 of the dead were middle school students. The official news agency Petra said 37 students, along with seven adults, had been touring near the Dead Sea when heavy rains unleashed flash floods in the area.
BY THE 1980S, IT WAS EASY TO SEE that the Alaska Air National Guard had changed immensely from the early days of the 8144th Air Base Squadron. It had not only grown larger but evolved, gaining experience and taking on more responsibility as it matured. That being the case, it was perhaps no surprise when, at age 34, the organization spun off a new unit of its own. The 168th Air Refueling Squadron started life in 1986 as the 176th Tactical Airlift Group's Eielson-based Detachment 1. Its mission, under Lt. Col. Doug Clinton, was to build a tanker unit from the ground up.
Slamming the opposition for stalling the reform process in the country through the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that GST will bring in economic integration in the country. “There are some people working for putting obstacles on growth and hence are stopping GST as well. All the chief ministers are in favour of GST, even the opposition is in favour. There are no numbers to stop it in the Parliament and hence, they adopted a new strategy of affecting the working of Parliament during the three day extension adopted for passing GST.
Cinema Guzzo has changed its rules to allow children under the age of two to go to the 10:30 a.m. movie screenings for free. “I’m calling it the Stuart Becker amendment,” Vince Guzzo, executive vice-president and COO of Cinema Guzzo, told Global News. The change comes after Becker told Global News that he, his wife and two children went to see Finding Dory over the weekend. “I wanted to take my almost three-year-old son for his first movie ever,” he explained. However, because his wife is breastfeeding their two-month-old daughter, the couple didn’t want to leave her behind.
About a month ago, SportsCenter host Jemele Hill stirred up some controversy when she used her personal Twitter account to point out that Donald Trump is “a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself with other white supremacists.” While a lot of people constantly do that same thing all the time without anyone getting mad, the backlash against Hill was so extreme that ESPN released an apology, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called for Hill to be fired, and Trump himself even retaliated in the most vicious way he could think of (by tweeting that ESPN has bad ratings).
The other day on social media someone asked about the difference between the words тайна and секрет, both of which mean, in part, “secret.” I thought: Oh! What a great question! The difference is actually quite simple… well, one is native Russian and one is borrowed from … um… somewhere, though originally, um, from the Latin… but of course there is a distinction… mutter, mutter… sound of dictionaries being pulled off shelves and frantic flipping of pages. What a perfect way to spend a snowy evening!

THURSDAY’S PUZZLE— Nothing brings people together like a good one-liner. The inspiration for today’s puzzle, constructed by David Steinberg and Bruce Leban, came from a quip that Bruce delivered at the National Puzzlers’ League convention. The pair was able to work this joke into a puzzle, and you will find it spread across four entries in today’s grid. Leaving the theme aside for a moment, the puzzle lived up to a Thursday-level of trickiness. There were precious few giveaways in the fill, with entries like ZANTAC, HEINE and ENAMELER requiring a lot of time to figure out.
Collider was in attendance this morning at a press event in Burbank where Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group celebrated their 90th anniversary* (*technically the company turns ninety on April 4th, 2013) by unveiling their new 90-year logo and announcing a slate of new Blu-ray and DVD transfers. However the biggest surprise was an announcement that they’re currently working on a special restoration and conversion of the 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz from 2D to 3D. The new 3D edition of The Wizard of Oz will hit shelves everywhere sometime next year in September or October.
Disney stock jumped 10% in early trading on Friday, to a record high of $128, one day after the Mouse House revealed its upcoming $7-per-month streaming service. Netflix’s stock on Friday morning, meanwhile, dipped 3.3%, with many analysts now seeing the upcoming Disney+ streaming service as its chief competition. Disney, led by CEO Bob Iger and a slew of other executives, walked investors through its new service, dubbed Disney+, in a nearly three-hour investor presentation on Thursday afternoon. There was a lot to cover.
Lahore's squad has only one technician who responds to 35 bomb threats every month. Lahore's bomb disposal squad (BDS) has only one technician who responds to nearly 35 bomb threats every month, that too with a screwdriver, scissors and a rope only! And, he performs the job in the field sans bombproof jackets or blankets and explosive detectors! The BDS department uses tools like those of hairdressers to defuse all types of bombs and has only one vehicle, which was given to them in 1987. A new vehicle was approved in 2005, which is used by other officers, reported the Daily Times.
Managers Neil Warnock and Billy Davies were angered after Crystal Palace's Clint Hill and Nottingham Forest's Paul Anderson clashed in their 1-1 draw. Hill appeared to elbow Anderson during the match but was unpunished, although he was booked for squaring up to Chris Gunter in the subsequent melee. "It was a red card and when Neil Warnock doesn't complain to you then you know he also knows," said Davies. Warnock argued: "It was a yellow card. It was reckless but not deliberate." When the incident took place on the stroke of half-time, Davies leapt off the bench to protest.
When Doveman (Thomas Bartlett) kicked off his Burgundy Stain Sessions at (Le) Poisson Rouge—a series of shows modeled on old-world salons, where an eclectic group of artists would convene for a night of semi-improvised entertainment—the evening was full of special moments.

Minister Gajdoš ordered that professional soldiers who were active in the paramilitary group are excluded from the Slovak army. Defence Minister Peter Gajdoš (junior coalition party, SNS) ordered the exclusion of professional soldiers who were active in the paramilitary grouping Slovak Levies from army ranks, without stating the precise number. The minister pointed out, as quoted by the Aktuality.sk website, that the group is trying to replace the state's role in defending the nation. “Professionals take part in these activities and pass on their experience to civilians,” Gajdoš explained, as cited by the website.
Elections to revive a defunct forum have been postponed to the end of August. The Mitchell’s Plain Community Policing Forum (CPF) initiated elections along with the three active block watches in the Westridge area to elect a subforum. A forum executive was elected five years ago but was declared dysfunctional and disbanded. The CPF then called for organisations to register as part of the forum at the end of July, with the election set to be held on Wednesday last week. Ashley Potts, CPF deputy chairperson, says the meeting needed to be postponed due to the lack of a quorum.

"The windows, the bare walls. It was that every day. Every single day. They put me in a room on my own, I was in isolation," says Casey, 16. More than 200 pupils spent at least five straight days in isolation booths in schools in England last year, a BBC News investigation has learned. Casey's school disputes the length of time he spent on his own and said he was "regularly disruptive". The teenager says he was placed on his own after he contracted fibromyalgia. He takes the painkiller Tramadol for the chronic pain condition.

"We can't go back to school," one boy told Gene Rosen. "Our teacher is dead." Gene Rosen had just finished feeding his cats and was heading from his home near Sandy Hook Elementary school to a diner Friday morning when he saw six small children sitting in a neat semicircle at the end of his driveway. A school bus driver was standing over them, telling them things would be all right. It was about 9:30 a.m., and the children, he discovered, had just run from the school to escape a gunman.
When SoCal natives move out of the state, they normally miss two things: weather and In-N-Out. That proved particularly true for Ryan DeForeest of Norwalk. On a visit home from film school in New York, he's eaten at In-N-Out not once, but five times. Last week, he was enjoying a late-night dinner at the restaurant with his friend. When they walked back to his car after dinner, DeForeest paused to admire the design of the restaurant's logo. He then thought that capturing his friend in front of the logo would make for a beautiful image.
Patent-holder&apos;s lawyer says city did not try to deliberately cheat client. The city of Naperville could be liable for unspecified financial "royalties" a Florida-based company contends it is owed in the wake of the city's installation of its "smart meter" utility system. The owners of Miami-based Atlas IP maintain they patented the way in which a smart meter "hub" controls communications between the "remotes" installed at residences and businesses in the network, said George C. Summerfield, of the Stadheim & Grear Ltd. Law firm of Chicago, which represents the company.
A few major VPN services used by businesses contain a security bug that could allow a hacker to infiltrate a company's internal network. The problem affects VPN software from Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, and Pulse Secure, according to a security advisory from the US's Computer Emergency Response Team division (CERT/CC.) It deals with how the VPN applications store cookies, which can keep you logged in without needing to enter a username and password each time. Normally, these cookies should be encrypted, but the affected VPN applications store the data in non-encrypted memory and log files within a computer, CERT says.
Publishers identify and publish books that attract readers. Book publishers take responsibility for all aspects of book publication. Their aim is to attract good authors and publish books that achieve commercial success. Depending on the size of the publishing company, the book publisher may carry out all aspects of publication, or may delegate part of the work to editors, designers and marketing specialists. Some publishers concentrate on broad categories, such as fiction or non-fiction. Others specialize within those broad sectors, publishing non-fiction books on art, business or science, for example.

Russell is used to covering the BlackBerry market at BBHub. But when the BBHub was decommissioned it made a lot of sense to toss another blog Russell's way. He also covers broadband and VOIP for ZDNet. While Russell has been riffing on the BlackBerry 8800 today Research in Motion's patent application for a "pickpocket mode" when a device is stolen may have bigger implications.
What exactly happened and/or who is to blame, if anyone, will be up to the courts to decide. But it’s still a tragedy. It will be quite some time before we know the outcomes from a host of inevitable lawsuits filed on behalf of those who lost their lives in the Branson duck boat tragedy a few weeks back. And of course, it will be even longer before those families can get back to some sense of normalcy (if they ever do) in their lives and back to what they would call a regular routine.
As the San Antonio Spurs continue to come to terms with a 67-15 regular season ending in the second round of the playoffs, the biggest question surrounding the team remains whether franchise icon Tim Duncan will retire. If the 40-year-old Duncan – or 38-year-old Manu Ginobili, for that matter – has made a decision one way or the other, he’s certainly not tipping his hand. Duncan has won five titles and Ginobili four with the Spurs, but they are slowing down. Duncan averaged a career-low 8.6 points and 7.3 rebounds this season, and those numbers dropped to 5.9 points and 4.8 rebounds in the playoffs.

Due to a sharp decline in metallurgical coal exports, as well as a near weeklong disruption at the Port of Virginia from Hurricane Florence, US coal exports fell to a six-month low 8.6 million mt in September, down 5.7% from 9.12 million mt in August, but were capped off by thermal exports, which were at the highest level since March 2013, US Census Bureau data showed. However, the latest month was up 6.6% from 8.07 million mt shipped out in the year-ago month. Thermal coal exports were at 4.9 million mt, up 23.2% from August and 56% higher year on year.

Police work the scene where two people were shot on Chicago's South Side on April 24, 2018. Epileptics who live in areas with higher crime rates, including the South Side and the Loop, had more seizures than those living in areas with less crime, according to a UIC study. Chicago residents with epilepsy who live in areas with higher crime rates, including the South Side and the Loop, had up to three times as many seizures in a month as those living in areas of the city with less crime, according to a University of Illinois at Chicago study presented Sunday at an annual American Epilepsy Society conference.

A proposed new lease agreement that would see one tenant’s price increase 44 percent drew a large crowd to Falcon Field in Peachtree City for the Airport Authority’s meeting Thursday night. Tommy Turner addressed the crowd and asked for a better solution than the one that is being offered. “The new lease terms and other fees will raise our rent by 44 percent and reduce the length of the lease to five years. My first thought upon receiving this huge increase was that the airport must really be in a financial bind.
A member of the team that carried out the only major scientific study of the Turin Shroud has dismissed new claims that the shroud was an item in a medieval Easter ritual rather than the burial cloth of Christ. The claims came in an article in the magazine History Today. Historian and author Charles Freeman argued that the famous linen cloth was probably used in a 14th-century Easter re-enactment of the Resurrection known as the Quem Queritis, “Whom do you seek?” The dating ties in with the 1988 radio-carbon findings, although these have been disputed by believers in the ancient and miraculous origins of the shroud.
C.S. Lewis is one of the most inspirational and enlightening Christian theologian and novelist of the 20th century. I was introduced to C.S. Lewis’ writings during college and read many of his works each year to strengthen my faith. His perspectives on scripture, faith, and God make you think for yourself and challenges you to think about your faith at a deeper level. These C.S. Lewis quotes are some of the most inspirational of all his quotes and may be the encouragement you need today. One of the most powerful passages from Mere Christianity is C.S.

We're back with another edition of 'Design in 9' -- our series on the d.school fellows and their response to five questions around their experience. Since we've started the series, we've accumulated the songs, as promised, in a playlist on Spotify. We will continue to add to this as we publish the remaining pieces in the series. 1. What is the most important thing you have learned about design thinking? Prototype to learn. Never stop prototyping. My motto is BAB (be always in beta). 2. What is your favorite song to play when leading a design workshop?
Politically entrenched in a self-made predicament, US President Barack Obama is going through tough times these days regarding Syria. Those whom he thought would unconditionally support him in launching an invasion of Syria, ridding the West of Bashar al-Assad, and installing a West-friendly puppet in the country have turned their backs on him. The President has now no choice but to wait for the formal report the UN would release on Monday to expose the real culprit behind the use of chemical weapons in Syria which reportedly killed 1500 people, among them, women and children. But does it really matter what the UN report would be?

Researchers are hoping that a new cancer screening test will eventually be part of routine health check-ups as a way to catch the disease early. MIAMI • A new blood test for cancer has shown promise of detecting eight different kinds of tumours before they have spread elsewhere in the body, offering hope of early detection, researchers said on Thursday. Further study is needed before the test - called CancerSEEK - can be made widely available for its projected cost of about US$500 (S$660), said the report in the journal Science.
Lloyd Webber was born in London on March 22, 1948. His father was a faculty member at the Royal College of Music and his mother was a piano teacher. Andrew showed musical aptitude at a very young age, and, while still a youth, composed short musical entertainments for his family. His first musical was “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” (1967). With lyricist Tim Rice, Lloyd Webber created an eclectic score to accompany the Old Testament story of Joseph and his brothers. Musical numbers ranged in style from Elvis-style rock to calypso and soft rock ballads.
In June of 1921, F. W. Woolworth Company opened a new 5, 10, and 15 cent store on the corner of E. Houston and Alamo Streets, where the Maverick Bank Building once stood. The $225,000 building had been designed by Adams and Adams. This local architectural firm went on to design other noteworthy structures, including Jefferson High School, the Hall of State for the Texas Centennial in Dallas, and the Alamo Cenotaph, featuring Pompeo Coppini's sculptures. Woolworth's, a popular national discounter, first came to San Antonio in 1912.
Cleanup operations after hurricane Charley moved into high gear in Florida, where 25 of 67 counties were declared disaster zones eligible for federal aid, officials declared Sunday. More than 4,000 National Guard troops, 600 law-enforcement officers, and hundreds of power-company workers have been deployed to areas along the track of the storm, which hit Friday halfway between Sarasota and Naples on the gulf coast and moved off into the Atlantic Ocean near Daytona Beach. The number of deaths rose to 16 Sunday as rescuers assessed the impact of the fiercest hurricane to strike Florida in 12 years.
Parents seeking answers gathered Thursday for the last of 10 town halls on youth mental health. APPLETON - Parents seeking answers gathered Thursday evening for the last of 10 town halls on youth mental health in Wisconsin. Panelists acknowledged the shortage of mental health professionals in the state and offered advice to parents on navigating the often complex world of mental health care and in reaching out to kids who are in crisis. "Be a strong advocate for your kids," said Hugh Davis, executive director of Wisconsin Family Ties, a Madison-based advocacy group for families dealing with mental health issues.
Following on from our earlier report this week which confirmed a surprise China event for Apple’s upcoming iPhone 5S and 5C launches, it appears that the juicy gossip is continuing to emerge from the Far East. We now have a potential launch date to give you for when the Chinese market may receive both new products, and it is pleasantly surprising to say the least. To recap briefly, Apple will hold a satellite stream to the Chinese audience on September 11 – just one day after wrapping up their main festivities at the Apple Campus in Cupertino.
Sometimes, comedy seems like the simplest machine in the world. You start off, down a sentence, and just when you think you've got the gist, the writer pulls the e-brake. Oh elegant irony, thy name is hardy har har. Today, after decades of rewarding Commenters of the Day with images of scantily-clad "professionals," $kaycog receives a COTD of her own. Yes, I said "her," (which is secret code for that strangely built, yet alluring creature in the photograph above the calendar hanging on your garage wall).
So, is cyber insurance worth it? Is it right for your company? What type of coverage should you get? How much is enough? And what are the gotchas to watch out for? The first point to understand is that standard business insurance does not cover data breaches or almost any other loss involving data. Standard insurance covers tangible losses and damage. Data isn't tangible. For that distinction you can thank American Guarantee & Liability Insurance Co. vs. Ingram Micro Inc., a U.S. District Court ruling in Arizona in 2000.
The way we approach business is changing. As we continually pivot to keep pace with rapidly evolving technology, individual departments within an organization are becoming as agile as the larger companies themselves. IT departments are experiencing tremendous changes as their roles expand to impact customer service, sales, and even business strategies. As a result, organizations are increasingly turning IT into a driving force in all aspects of business. One thing to understand when managing the growing pains of IT is that it’s no longer the work of a single department.
It’s dense, interesting, weird and funny, but what it’s all wrapped around is another “Chosen One” story that really feels drawn out and convoluted, crumbling into something tiresome and tedious. Where the science-fiction genre is concerned, it’s not hard to at the very least appreciate the ambition of the storytelling. It takes an honest, extra layer of creativity to create a reality not bound by the restrictions of our own, and it can be a delight to watch a perfect mixture of detailed universe building mesh with smart, unique storytelling.
American officials have accused Russian-backed hackers of trying to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election by leaking Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s emails. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin denied this. But in doing so, he also questioned the nature of the American democracy, and threw a little love to his bro, GOP nominee Donald Trump. Putin’s shadow has loomed large over the 2016 presidential race. On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly praised the Russian leader for commanding more respect than Clinton or President Barack Obama.
Hearts winger Andrew Driver could yet switch allegiance to Scotland even if he plays for England at the European Under-21 Championships this week. Driver was an unused substitute as England beat Finland 2-1 in their opening match on Monday. But a draft Fifa proposal would allow players like Driver to switch as long he has not played a full international. The home nations are awaiting approval for extending their own eligibility rules to five years schooling. Only if world football's governing body gives the green light to both proposals would 21-year-old Oldham-born Driver be eligible to play for both England and Scotland at full international level.
The occupant was said to be violent, so officer Carlos Ramirez approached the apartment warily. A dank smell wafted from inside. Ramirez bristled with body armour, radio, gun and Taser, but before knocking on the door he adjusted just one piece of equipment: a tiny camera on his collar. A tubby, barefoot man with broken teeth and wild eyes opened the door. He appeared to be high. Ramirez questioned him about allegedly beating and evicting his stepson, a mentally disabled teenager. The man shifted from foot to foot and babbled about death threats.
Without eye contact, I felt as though I was talking to someone immersed in a crossword puzzle, only speaking to me absentmindedly in hopes I could cough (please) up an answer to help him fill in the blank squares. Yes, I want my doctor to be conversant with the latest medical technology, but not at the expense of conversing with me. The problem of electronic absorption in the doctor’s office seems to be common, as evidenced by a Viewpoint article (subscription required) published online today by the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Mata will go straight in for his debut against Cardiff at Old Trafford tonight with Moyes insisting the arrival of the club’s £37.1m record signing will give United the impetus to clinch qualification for the Champions League which he admits is “imperative”. Rovin Van Persie is also back after two months out with a thigh injury as United bid to start a winning run to avoid the embarrassment of failing to qualify for European football’s elite club competition for the first time in nearly two decades. United are seventh and manager Moyes said: “Undoubtedly, this club wants to be at the top.
Grand Forks Central pitcher Zach Vodden spent the start of the 2019 spring high school baseball season throwing indoors at Gambucci Arena as the Knights waited for this winter’s heavy snow to melt and dry. The 6-foot-1 righthander was outdoors on the Kraft Field mound for the first time this season on Tuesday night and the senior appeared in midseason form. The top NFL draft analysts don't have any UND football players being selected in this weekend's seven rounds. Saturday, though, could still be an exciting day for the pro futures of five former Fighting Hawks.
HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (WHNT) – Board members and staff of the Harris Home for Children gathered Thursday morning to celebrate with community leaders and supporters during a ribbon cutting for a new activity center and residence hall. The organization caters to foster children, ages 12 to 21, from around the state who are placed here as wards of the state. Carol Claflin, a board member and mentor, said the staff takes care of the residents, offering mentoring, tutoring, transportation and other resources to help them gain education and move towards positive changes in their lives until they leave or are reunited with their families.
The taxpayer-funded guide — entitled “Career corner: Understanding microaggressions” — also identifies golf outings and the words “boyfriend” and “girlfriend” as microaggressions. The UNC Chapel Hill guide, published on Thursday, covers a wide range of menacing microaggressions — which are everyday words that radical leftists have decided to be angry or frustrated about. Interestingly, the long break between semesters at UNC Chapel Hill for the 2016-2017 academic year will last from December 17 to January 10 — thus covering Christmas as well as the New Year’s Day of the Gregorian calendar.
Carly Simon says the second verse of her infamous song "You're So Vain" is about Warren Beatty. The 70-year-old singer tells People magazine that she's "confirmed that the second verse is Warren." She adds that Beatty "thinks the whole thing is about him!" Simon will release the memoir, "Boys in the Trees," on Nov. 24. The subjects behind "You're So Vain," released in 1972, have been a matter of speculation for years. The singer said the No. 1 hit is about three men, including Beatty, though she isn't naming the others.

What Will Retailers Do With Billions in Corporate Tax Savings? As investors work to identify the winners and losers of the recent tax bill, it&apos;s clear that one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new corporate tax rate will be the retail sector. In this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Vincent Shen recruits senior Motley Fool contributor Adam Levine-Weinberg to break down why the news is so good for retailers and its likely effect on companies, including TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX), Target (NYSE: TGT), and Macy&apos;s (NYSE: M).
Intel easily topped analyst estimates for the fourth quarter, reporting records in virtually all of its meaningful metrics for the year as a whole. Intel’s sales typically peak during the holiday sales season. A number of analysts polled by Yahoo Finance had expected earnings of 66 cents per share and revenue of $14.7 billion. For the fourth quarter, Intel matched the revenue expectation of $14.7 billion, a 6 percent increase, but exceeded the earnings expectation, hitting 74 cents per share. Intel also reported profits of $3.7 billion, up a whopping 39 percent from a year prior.
With 32 of 81 seats filled, the MSA Senate is taking measures to attract more members. Missouri Students Association held their first senate meeting of 2019 at Hulston Hall on Feb. 5, 2019.

With a love of partying, she's never had a reputation as much of a demure type of singer. And Kesha was all the more determined to have fun in the sun in true carefree style as she larked around on a boat in Brazil with a group of friends yesterday. The 24-year-old singer boarded a boat called Felicita Due in Sao Paolo where she munched on snacks and gave onlookers an eyeful as her bikini bottoms slipped down a little too far. The singer wore a rose-printed one-piece swimsuit and grey trilby style hat with her blonde wavy hair loose around her shoulders.
"Finding Feminism: Millennial Activists and the Unfinished Gender Revolution"
From the publisher: In 2014, after a young man murdered six students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and then killed himself, the news provoked an eye-opening surge of feminist activism. Fueled by the wide circulation of the killer’s hateful manifesto and his desire to exact “revenge” upon young women, feminists online and offline around the world clamored for a halt to such acts of misogyny. Despite the widespread belief that feminism is out-of-style or dead, this mobilization of young women fighting against gender oppression was overwhelming.
The hybrid device may very well sport a qHD screen resolution and a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor. In the five months since Asus announced the Asus Padfone, few details have been revealed about this Android smartphone that can turn into a tablet. On Monday, however, specs leaked on a mobile benchmarking tool reveal the hybrid device may very well sport a qHD screen resolution and a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor. Notebook Italia spotted the Asus in the GLBenchmark database, where you'll find in the system info area a Qualcomm MSM8960 SoC processor, part of the Snapdragon S4 platform.
WHEN the former Irish international football star and now Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn first met his beautiful wife Gillian in 1990, he wasn't deterred by the fact that there was a five-year age gap between them. "Gillian was far more mature than I was," he says. "I was just a kid really. She was 18 going on 30, and I was 23, still waiting for my 18th." When they met, Gillian was working as a model, taking part in a photocall for Ballygowan at Dalymount Park.
Hundreds of people around the upper Midwest, especially in Wisconsin and Illinois, have reported witnessing a fireball event early Monday. At around 1:30am Central Time, the fireball was spotted by witnesses as far west as Wisconsin and as far east as New York, the American Meteor Society (AMS) reported Monday. Trajectory estimates compiled through witness reports suggested the meteor "ended its flight on the Lake Michigan somewhere between Sheboygan, Wi and Manitowoc wi," [sic] AMS wrote. AMS, a nonprofit that monitors reports of meteors and similar phenomena, has fielded more than 200 sighting reports of the event.
Brian Sullivan singled home Calvin Rogers with one out in the bottom of the 13th inning to give host Lansdowne a 1-0 victory over Franklin (11-6) in the state Class 3A, Region II title game yesterday and advance the Vikings (13-4) to a semifinal game against Thomas Stone today at Arundel at 7 p.m.
Rogers led off the inning with a walk, and went to third on a wild pitch and a single by Pat Parsons. After Adam Keim was walked intentionally and Randy Musgrove flied out to right, Sullivan got the game-winning hit.
IN DECEMBER 1994 I wrote the first of what would become a yearly series of columns on the subject of liberal hate speech. That was the year Republicans swept the midterm elections to win control of Congress, and ideological passions were running high. I had noticed that when a prominent Republican or conservative said something offensive about liberals, it typically set off a storm of media condemnation, while an anti-conservative smear voiced by a liberal or a Democrat rarely drew any protest. There was no end of sour commentary, for example, when Newt Gingrich recommended that Clinton Democrats be portrayed as "the enemy of normal Americans."
The University of Louisville’s Athletic Association approved a plan Friday that would reduce single-ticket prices for some upper- and mid-level sections next season. LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) - If you’re already looking ahead to UofL basketball tickets for next season, you could end up paying less.

With no end in sight to their gloom, shop owners at Manish and Sara-Sahara market are facing an arduous task in locating new premises. Taking advantage of the lack of rental space after the fire, majority of the shopkeepers say that shop owners in the vicinity are soliciting higher rentals that is way above the market rate. Traders, most of them in debt, who are already facing enormous losses, grumble that galas which were earlier available for Rs 8,000 per square feet are now selling at Rs18,000 plus. Moreover, merchants who have decided to relocate to neighbouring Crawford market are also in distress.
The Investigative Committee plans to spend 1.1 million rubles ($36,300) on monitoring media and social networking sites in 2013, with more than 3,000 publications to be analyzed, news reports said Monday. According to a report on Lenta.ru, the Investigative Committee will focus on, among other things, media that "offer criticism in relation to the Investigative Committee," "criticize government and law enforcement bodies" and "commit crimes against children."

A Whangārei woman is urging motorists to travel with their doors locked after a man tried to climb into her car as she drove home from a late night shift. Krystal Marsh, 25, has spoken out after the scary incident early yesterday. "I just finished work and was at the lights on Hatea Dr heading towards Nixon St and someone tried to jump in my car. Not only did they try the front door they also tried the back door too," Marsh recalled. At the time Marsh was on her own and had no cellphone with her.
You heard it for years but after a while it sounded more like a defense mechanism than a demand. Buffalo hockey fans conditioned themselves into thinking a hard-working team mattered most, which was their way of taking comfort knowing the effort was there when the talent was not. The Sabres are immensely skilled and have been scoring at a furious pace since the Olympic break, but we should appreciate how often those pretty plays began rather than gush over where they ended. Take a step back and see how good Toni Lydman and Henrik Tallinder have been this season. OK, stop yawning.
TORONTO -- Streaks are not built on blowouts alone. There have to be a few nail-biters along the way just to keep things interesting. But this was above and beyond. The Indians ruined Canada Day for the Blue Jays on Friday, winning a franchise-record 14th straight game with a 2-1 triumph in 19 innings at Rogers Centre. The Jays, who had manager John Gibbons and two players ejected, lost for the eighth time in their last 12 games. The 6-hour, 13-minute affair was the Indians' longest since they played 21 innings against the Twins on Aug. 31, 1993.
The man who stole a teenager’s Make America Great Again hat called the incident a lapse in judgment and said that seeing the cap was like seeing a Ku Klux Klan hood, he told KSAT 12 News. Kino Jimenez, 30, of San Antonio has been charged with felony theft after the incident at Whataburger in which he dumped a drink on the 16-year-old. KSAT 12 was on the scene as Jimenez left jail after posting bail. On his way out of jail early Friday morning, he tried at first to avoid a KSAT 12 News camera.
Don't just open the can this Thanksgiving. In a heavy bottomed saucepan, combine the water, vinegar, orange juice and sugar. Bring to a simmer to dissolve the sugar. Add the cranberries , orange zest and salt. Stir to mix, cover and gently boil for about 12 minutes or until some of the cranberries begin to pop open. Stir to mash some of the cranberries and allow their natural thickening to incorporate into the liquid. Note that the sauce will thicken upon cooling so don’t worry if it looks a little too thin. Taste the sauce for sugar content.

Low-income advocates question disruption to health care, future shift of tax burden from wealthy to middle-class. (Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) Bonnie Mitchell who has Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, an inherited connective tissue disease lends her voice to speak out over the current tax plan being discussed that eliminates the deception for medical expenses and long term care. A group of Utahns gathered to rally at the Wallace Bennett Federal Building in Salt Lake on Monday, Nov. 20, 2017, to tell personal stories of how they might be impacted by the tax reform plans currently on the table in Congress.
In 2011, Tel Aviv’s Daphni Leef helped ignite the J14 movement for social change. She looks back at what went wrong. The Tel Aviv tent protesters say they speak for a nation demanding social justice. In truth, they’re entitled yuppies who’ve finally found something worth fighting for: themselves. Protests against increasing housing prices in Israel shake the Netanyahu government. But in the tent cities erected as part of the campaign, the conversation is about civil society. In the recent tent-city protests, middle-class Israelis took to the streets to protest a political system that ignores them.
BANGKOK, Thailand - Ten years ago, a plunge in the Thai baht sparked a wave of recessions across Asia's high-flying economies, bankrupting entire nations, putting millions out of work and shaking markets around the world. Some feared that decade of growth would be lost. Today, the region as a whole has bounced back from the 1997-98 crisis and is better equipped to deal with financial emergencies. Banking is more transparent, corporations are better managed, poverty rates have dropped and the region's collective economic growth has doubled. Still, the recovery has been uneven.
While leading evidence, defence lawyer Lesego Mmusi said police could have implemented other measures and avoided a violent clash. Mmusi is requesting the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrate's Court to consider the bail hearing of the group of men in detention as an urgent matter. "It is undisputed that the group had been gathering on that hill every day and dispersing every night. Why didn't the police cordon off the hill at night and in the morning the people would find the place secured," asked Mmusi. "They [police] didn't apply the reasonable means in this matter.
Why Does a Woman's Razor Cost $1.08 When a Man's Razor Only Costs 75 Cents? Blame it on the so-called 'pink tax,' where products aimed at women cost more than similar ones designed for men. The so-called "Pink Tax" is neither pink nor a tax. Rather, it's alleged gender-based price discrimination that critics say consumers face when buying items aimed at girls or women vs. almost identical goods that are gender-neutral or designed for males. What's the big deal about paying a few extra pennies for a shirt or a razor?
As we reflect on the lessons learned through the big-data boom, of how organisations securely capture, store and retrieve data and how they can derive value from these huge data sets, we must begin to prepare for a yet another new wave of data. This data will come from millions of new Internet enabled devices, a continued push towards the use of virtualised machines and the adoption of cloud enabled business-critical applications. This volume will make it more important than ever for organisations to holistically manage their data and storage more intelligently, and cloud services will be a key element to achieve this.
SPECIAL POST — Lots of complaints about the answer LENE (16-Across — “Voiceless consonant like “b” or “p”) in today’s crossword. Because I figured few solvers today know what LENE means (the last dictionary it seems to have appeared in is Webster’s Second New International in 1934, where it was already labeled “rare”), I decided to spell it out with examples. Unfortunately, the example “b” is wrong. That is a voiced consonant, not a voiceless one.
Feb 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Monday as the latest trade talks between the United States and China began in Beijing, while U.S. lawmakers attempted to hammer out a deal to avoid another government shutdown. China struck an upbeat note on the talks and the Shanghai exchange rose 1 percent after a week-long Lunar New Year holiday, but a U.S. Navy mission through the disputed South China Sea weighed on sentiment. The latest discussions come against the backdrop of last month’s negotiations ending without a deal and the top U.S. negotiator declaring that a lot more work needed to be done.
Public urination has gotten so bad in San Francisco that the city has painted nine walls with a repellant paint that makes pee spray back on the offender. Mohammed Nuru, director of San Francisco&apos;s public works department, says offenders will need to make the mistake only once to get the idea. "If you have to go," he said, "go in the right place." Nuru got the idea from Germany, where walls in Hamburg&apos;s St. Pauli quarter are painted with the material to encourage late-night beer drinkers to find a bathroom rather than an alleyway.

For those who are preparing to mourn for Mad Men, why not start the healing now . . . with nature’s favorite antidepressant, scotch? * So send your secretary to the store to pick up some Wemyss, a pack of cigarettes, a Rand McNally map to nowhere, and yeah, some chrysanthemum tincture—because you’re going to need it. This week’s cocktail comes to us from Fung Tu, a delicious Chinese-American spot of the non-takeout variety on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Think pork belly egg rolls, Chinese spaetzle, peanut-butter-and-chocolate sesame balls, and other magical combinations.

Financial sanctions under GOP attorney general are lower than previous leaders of the Justice Department. Attorney General Brad Schimel reported penalties on environmental cases totaled $226,770 in the first quarter of the year. The Justice Department in 2017 prosecuted cases totaling $1.45 million — the highest in Schimel’s first three years in office, but lower than the average of recent attorneys general. Schimel, a Republican, is running for re-election this year. The penalties in the first three months involved 12 cases related to polluting waterways and wetlands; air pollution and solid waste violations; and pollution problems related to underground storage tanks.
Fans of “Game of Thrones” have gotten used to getting jolts in the series’ penultimate episode — this time, the shocks came in the finale. And they kept coming. Cersei’s walk of shame. Arya’s bloody act of vengeance. And yes, Jon Snow’s death. Director David Nutter — who also helmed the infamous Red Wedding episode — breaks down all the twists and turns behind the episode. How do you approach such a big, complicated episode? My first reaction is complete and utter fear. How am I going to basically do this?
Things get a bit messy in a new brand campaign from Chobani. Centered on the tag "Love This Life," its anthem film opens with a young family -- dad, mom, young daughter and son -- looking a bit worse for the wear as they trudge back to their farmhouse, caked in mud, pulling a calf along. All is not quite right as the woman glares back at her husband when he looks at her regretfully -- we don't know quite why -- maybe he let the calf get away and the kids got lost trying to retrieve it.

The Winnipeg Police Service says overtime costs are down — and could have been lower except for the Winnipeg Jets’ NHL playoff Whiteout street parties. The WPS will present their second-quarter report at the police board meeting at city hall on Friday, which says overtime costs to the end of June are down 11.54 per cent compared to the same period last year. Those numbers would have been much lower, however, officers were assigned to the Whiteout street parties, which counts as overtime they said. Also down is photo radar revenue — the report projects a $900,000 drop by the end of the year.
Peter Shumlin (left) held a 190-vote lead in the Democratic primary Wednesday afternoon. Shumlin claims victory in Vt.
With all precincts now reporting in the Vermont Democratic primary for governor, Peter Shumlin clung to a 190-vote lead and was ready to claim victory Wednesday afternoon, but his nearest rival, Doug Racine, wasn’t ready to concede just yet. When all precinct totals were tallied at 1:30 p.m. ET Wednesday, Shumlin had expanded his razor-thin lead to 190 votes, taking 25.1 percent of the vote to Racine’s 24.8 percent.
"Family Guy" creator Seth MacFarlane is going back to the future to resurrect "The Flintstones." It's gotten so that just seeing the words "reboot" or "remake" in a headline about a new version of a popular TV show or movie is enough to make us cringe. We've been conditioned by years of disappointment to expect the worst. But even after suffering through re-imagined renderings of "Psycho," "Bewitched" and "The Dukes of Hazzard,” we maintain a glimmer of hope that Hollywood somehow won't screw it up again.
It takes thousands of forks, knives and plates to feed 2,500 of your closest friends, but the restaurants in Park City, Utah, were up to it Saturday night. Thirty establishments, their chefs and wait staff moved outdoors to historic Main Street to serve dinner on a half-mile long "Grande Table" in the former silver mining town for "Savor the Summit." In its sixth year, the event offers flavors from sushi to Italian to steak. "There are many restaurants that put a ton of work into this," Ginger Ries, executive director for the Park City Area Restaurant Association.
Charlie: After working out and doing a few errands, I came home and realized that I had left my jacket in the locker room of the gym. This wasn’t the first (or probably the last) time that I had done something like this. It was more like the twentieth time that I’d left something-a book, a pair of socks, a shoe, a set of headphones, a towel, a lock, you name it- behind, only to discover the loss the next day or the next week, depending upon how regularly I happened to be working out at the time.

Who's ready to do some reading? !� Madailein's little chair looks perfect in the corner�with her new Owl-dorable coat tree!!
Malta and Slovakia have signed a memorandum of understanding setting the framework within which authorities from the two countries will identify, screen and facilitate the process of adoption of Slovak children by couples in Malta. The MoU was signed yesterday by Social Policy Minister and Slovak Social Affairs Minister Viera Tomanova in Slovakia. Both ministers emphasised that the priority would be the welfare of the children, who would be assisted to integrate into their adoptive Maltese families whilst retaining ties with Slovakia, their country of birth. They agreed that this process of integration would actually be facilitated by the fact that the two countries share similar values and traditions.
Why is Vectren pushing for an expensive, unnecessary plan that will harm its customers? As an engineer who works at an energy company and a father, I think a lot about the cost of energy. It’s a subject that’s particularly important to me as a lifelong resident of Southern Indiana, where our electric utility, Vectren, has forced consumers to pay the highest electricity rates anywhere in the Midwest — and is now putting forward a plan that would drive those rates even higher. While Vectren proudly points to essentially flat rates since 2011, those rates are still nearly 40% higher than the Indiana average.
Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian has hinted at new Armenia-related project in a series of Facebook posts. “It's almost time, my friends. Secret project unveiled tomorrow,” Ohanian said. “A secret project I’ve been working on is almost ready to share with you all. Hint: It involves patience, persistence, and wisdom,” Alexis said in another post. On Saturday, November 10, Alexis Ohanian took his family to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the ARMENIA! Exhibition. “That said, this collection was extensive and I learned a ton.
In a slow changing of the seasons we have seen winter outstay its welcome in the northern hemisphere. Likewise, summer has been reluctant to leave some areas south of the equator. Sydney, Australia continues to bathe in summer-like warmth. As of Monday, the temperature here reached 26 Celsius for the fourth day in a row. It has now been 45 years since the city has been as warm this late in the year. Indeed, in the past 150 years Sydney has only once seen such heat this late in the season, and that was back in 1968.
Regardless of what struggles you’re grappling with, know there is help available. That’s the message of a new installation, The Silent Screams Project, curated by Edmonton photographer Lorna Dancey, that involves four seven-foot columns covered in eight local stories which detail the ripple effect of family violence on victims, families, first responders and the community. As part of Family Violence Prevention Month, the city’s Family and Community Support Services (FCSS) and the Fort Saskatchewan Families First Society aided in the collaboration that is now on display at City Hall.

The mother of two who died alongside her three-year-old son when the tractor she was driving crashed was expecting her third child. Nadine Tomlinson, 33, and her three-year-old son Angus were trapped inside a tractor which lost control and slipped into a reservoir on their property in Dunback-Morrison in East Otago on Sunday afternoon. But today her grieving family revealed the accident had also claimed the life of their unborn child as well. Ann Restieaux, Nadine's mother was delighted when her youngest daughter told her she was 16 weeks pregnant. But now Restieaux and widower Scott Tomlinson are struggling with the enormity of what they've lost.
The preliminary agreement for a 1.9 percent pay boost runs counter to President Trump's recommendation for a pay freeze and faces Democratic opposition over other policy provisions. Republicans on Capitol Hill reportedly have reached a deal among themselves to include a 1.9 percent pay increase for federal civilian employees in 2019 in a spending bill, but Democrats say they will reject the deal over “partisan” add-ons. An agreement between House and Senate Republicans and offered to Democratic appropriators would provide a pay increase next year for federal workers, first included in a Senate spending bill, and it would lift a long-running pay freeze on some executives and political appointees.

Newfoundland health officials are having trouble finding medical specialists for Labrador's air ambulance service, the province's health minister said. The province moved the service's base to Happy Valley-Goose Bay last year from St. Anthony, and nurses and paramedics were supposed to be hired to fly with sick patients, but minister Jerome Kennedy said most of the applicants that have since applied for jobs did not have the right qualifications. "We were hoping that we will get that team in place but there has been some difficulty with recruiting both as a result of geography and the professional requirements," the minister said.
AT a recent media briefing held in Malacca City by DRB-Hicom Bhd, there was much focus and attention paid on the company’s biggest contributor: Proton Holdings Bhd. MELAKA: DRB-Hicom Bhd is in talks with two other auto brands to assemble their vehicles. A RARE red-flag by IHH Healthcare Bhd’s external auditors earlier this week cast the spotlight on the biggest public-listed hospital operator in Asia for all the wrong reasons. KUALA LUMPUR: Foreign donations are still subjected to tax on a ‘case by case’ basis, said the LHDN CEO Datuk Seri Sabin Samitah.

Rosie and the first rooster of the day during a birthday hunt at a game production area near Hot Springs. Rosie is shock-collar free and a little giddy prior to the hunt. About this time each year, I can really feel my age. The calendar tells part of the story. My birthday is Nov. 3. This year on that date, I turned 67, an age where a guy can feel things he didn’t feel at 47 or 27. Sore things, mostly. Aching things. But there are other reasons for my annual aging epiphany, Rosie and the pheasants included.

The family of Aharon Joseph Zindani, a Yemenite Jew who was murdered in his native country in May, is urging Yemen’s remaining Jews to emigrate to countries that are safer for Jewish people. Mr. Zindani, a native of Yemen who moved to Israel ten years ago, had returned to his native land in 2010 to sell his family’s remaining assets, after financial troubles plagued his father in Israel. Zindani’s brother-in-law explained that Zindani, who had become a community leader in his two years in Yemen, hoped to buy a small synagogue, among other things, in Rehovot, his hometown.
"Whoever gets him, they'll be getting a good one," David Montgomery said. INDIANAPOLIS — Hakeem Butler has been surrounded by some of the best wide receivers on the planet this week at the NFL Scouting Combine. It’s an experience that might humble some. But for Butler, it has only enhanced his confidence. As it stands, 22-year-old Butler is not regarded as the best wide receiver in this year’s NFL Draft. He’s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round.

CLEVELAND, Ohio - City Council on Wednesday approved a tax incentive program to help clear the way for redevelopment of a downtown Cleveland eyesore. Council, at the request of Mayor Frank Jackson's administration, approved a tax increment financing package that will support a $78-million makeover for the long-empty John Hartness Brown complex on Euclid Avenue. The complex -- across from the old Cleveland Athletic Club, which itself is being refurbished -- stretches from 1001 to 1101 Euclid Avenue between East Ninth and East 12th streets. Project developer Alto JHB Acquisition intends to refit the building with 228 market-rate apartments and 18,000 square feet of commercial space at ground level.
Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, has signed a Soviet-style law banning swearing in films, television broadcasts, books and public performances. In a move harking back to the cultural conservatism of Russia's Communist years, books containing "foul language" will have to carry a special warning, and offenders may be subject to fines of up to £830. The text of the new law “bans the use of obscene language while ensuring the rights of Russian citizens to the use of the state language, and protecting and developing language culture,” the Kremlin said in a statement.

She was chosen to the LHSAA's All-Academic Composite team and she also made a 34 on her ACT.
Kane Brown polled his fans on Twitter Wednesday (Jan. 30), asking for help buying a new car. Instead, he's the proud new owner of a new-to-him 1978 Ford truck. The reason why is pretty sweet. “I actually was going to buy a Chevelle and do a Vin Diesel, Fast and the Furious sort of thing," Brown tells Taste of Country, calling from his tour bus while on the road for his headlining arena tour, ‪Kane Brown Live Forever Tour Fueled by Marathon. "But I ended up getting the 78 Ford.
The U.S.-led coalition is committing to the creation of a 30,000-strong local force to protect Syria’s border regions for the ostensible purpose of preventing insurgencies, but Turkey is outraged at the idea of a force near its border. In an announcement Sunday, Coalition spokesman Army Col. Ryan Dillon told AFP that because direct combat operations against the Islamic State are starting to draw to a close, the new focus is on re-purposing local militias like the Syrian Democratic Forces to work on border security. “There is a goal of a final force of approximately 30,000,” Dillon said.
Council candidate upset after 20 campaign..
Council election campaigns are getting ugly. A former mayor was apparently arrested for defacing posters in Whittlesea, and Neil Mitchell has received a string of emails saying it’s not an isolated incident. One candidate for Knox Council has had his posters stolen and damaged. Sean Doherty told Neil he’s been informed damaging campaign material is illegal. Mr Doherty said that, as far as he’s aware, he’s the only candidate in his race that’s had posters damaged.
The Factor displaced his palate during his seventh-place finish in the Grade I Arkansas Derby on April 16 and underwent minor throat surgery last week to correct the issue. Baffert said his concerns about The Factor's one-dimensional running style and ability to handle the 11/4 miles were also big reasons he is inclined to point the son of War Front to a different race. A confirmed front-runner, The Factor blazed his way to victories in the Grade II San Vicente and a 61/4-length win in the Rebel while on the lead but was clearly not as comfortable when he had to sit off horses in the Arkansas Derby — displaced palate or not.

English football has been warned to clean up its financial mess or face government intervention to save the national game's reputation. The opposition Conservative Party's spokesman for sport Hugh Robertson says governance cannot be exempt from measures introduced in other parts of society and business. Dozens of clubs have gone into administration in recent years because of cashflow problems and unpaid debts, including the most high-profile casualty so far, Portsmouth, the first Premier League club to call in the accountants. Robertson could be be sports minister if the Conservatives win what is expected to be a close-fought election on Friday.
Simon Dawson/Bloomberg NewsStandard Chartered’s offices in London. The bank has been accused of helping the Iranian government conceal billions of dollars. LONDON — Long a golden child among global banks, the British bank Standard Chartered now wears a somewhat tarnished crown. The bank’s investors were rattled by accusations that it had schemed with the Iranian government to hide $250 billion in money transfers over nearly a decade. On Tuesday, shares of Standard Chartered fell as much as 25 percent — their sharpest one-day decline in more than two decades — before recovering to end London trading down 16 percent.
Due to the rising price of natural gas as a result of the ever increasing demand and hurricane induced supply shortages, there's an interesting story developing in Colorado. This winter, Xcel Energy's customers in Colorado who purchase Wind Source electricity will be paying "up to $10 less than their neighbors who use conventionally generated electricity" per month! This Denver Post article goes on to suggest that this could open a huge flow of customers wanting to transfer into the green power program for the economic savings alone. It's still up in the air whether the price differential will continue or if it's just a temporary phenomenon.
Phnom Penh's ChildSafe Network, managed by Friends International, involves key members of society and travellers in actively protecting urban children and youth from abuse by training them to recognise and respond to dangerous situations. ANZ Royal Bank, The ChildSafe Network and Java Arts on Monday launched the new SpotMap at the ChildSafe Center. Phnom Penh is becoming known for both its heritage and progressive culture, and the new SpotMap pinpoints the city's increasing number of galleries, performance spaces, studios and architectural icons in an effort to boost the Kingdom's cultural and tourism sectors.
From the latest polls it doesn't seem so, or there are not very many of them. Best NDP argument against the pipeline is that it is shipping jobs out of Canada. Another argument is the bulldozing of provincial rights. I think most Canadians want their municipal and provincial laws to be respected. The argument that democracy is undermined by BC thwarting the pipeline is nonsense. It is just the opposite. Democracy is being strengthened. Disputes are settled through dialog not force. If Alberta cannot convince BC to support or allow the pipeline then it shouldn't go through.
NEW YORK (AP) — A man who joined the Marines two days after the Sept. 11 attacks was sentenced Wednesday to a decade in prison after blaming post-traumatic stress disorder for car bombing his neighbor after a parking dispute. Despite a fireball and an explosion powerful enough to buckle the car’s doors, the victim miraculously escaped injury when the bomb was detonated as he drove down a Bronx street in 2016. U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said he would have sentenced Richard Laugel to 20 years in prison if not for his military heroism, which included two stints in Iraq.
The island is expected to receive at least tropical storm winds tomorrow, and possibly typhoon-strength winds. Typhoon Dolphin continued to strengthen yesterday and track toward the Mariana Islands. Guam is expected to receive at least tropical storm winds tomorrow, and possibly typhoon-strength winds. As of yesterday afternoon, the island was placed under Condition of Readiness 3, which means damaging winds are expected within 48 hours. Public schools and other government of Guam offices are scheduled to be open today, at least until the governor declares Condition of Readiness 2, which means damaging winds are expected within 24 hours.
Hemet residents will have a chance to speak out on the sanctuary state law at an upcoming workshop. Cities across the region have been coming out against SB 54, the California Values Act, which aims to shield undocumented immigrants from deportation, putting new limits on state and local law enforcement’s ability to help the federal government enforce immigration law. Hemet Mayor Michael Perciful announced Tuesday, April 24, that a workshop likely will be scheduled in the next month to discuss the law. Seven speakers addressed the Hemet City Council on Tuesday, three in favor and four opposed to the law.
By Savion Glover and Bruce Weber. William Morrow & Company. $19.95. Tap fits uneasily into book form. The dance is all about sound and movement; Gutenberg's descendants sit silent and static. The tap star Savion Glover, in particular, is all about loud: a heel hard enough to break the floor, a shuffle to make you skip a heartbeat. But the book works -- in part because it uses more than language. Sometimes its medium is a written approximation of metal against floor: ''Tickety BLOO kah tickety bloo kah SHUCK.''

For this week’s edition of our Throwback Thursday series we go back exactly five years ago this week to the launch of Belgard Kitchen in Railtown’s Settlement Building. I was able to tour the final stages of its construction a couple of weeks before its launch in April 2014. It was a confusing jumble at the time. Vancouver Urban Winery and FreshTAP were already in operation in the 7,700 sqft space, but incoming was Postmark Brewing and the 65 seat Belgard Kitchen. If I recall correctly, the brewing side of things was still very much under construction but the restaurant was only getting its kitchen equipment installed.
Young Lions skipper Brad Galvin isn’t afraid of taking his side’s ‘scrappy’ style of play into Sunday’s semi final clash with Henwood Park. Galvin has headlined the Lions’ defensive unit from centre back this season, putting together a string of solid performances to contain rival sides to just 28 goals in their 19 games to date. Now, the 27-year-old is relishing the lead-up to a shot at grand final glory and says there’s no reason why his team mates can’t tough out another gritty win against the favoured Hawks.
Going into May 2011, many of the games from April’s top 25 Facebook games stay with us while some foreign language games vanish. Add to that a few notable newcomers, and you’ve got our top 25 Facebook games for May 2011. First up, we sort the top 25 by daily active users. This gives us an idea of which games people tend to visit habitually. Be sure to compare this list to the top 25 monthly active users list for an idea of which games have a higher retention rate (or “sticky factor”) with players.
MANILA, Philippines - Freddie Aguilar â€œdeserves to be castratedâ€ for having a relationship with a 16-year-old girl, according to a lawyer who filed qualified seduction charges against the 60-year-old folk singer before the Quezon City prosecutorâ€™s office. â€œThis cradle snatcher wants to take advantage of the adulation of the child by pretending to be loving her and allegedly marrying her later. This old man deserves to be castrated to spare the children,â€ lawyer Fernando Perito said in his two-page complaint filed on Tuesday but released by the prosecutorâ€™s office yesterday. Perito charged Aguilar with qualified seduction under Article 337 of the Revised Penal Code.
At the risk of being run out of town by an angry, pizza-peel-wielding mob, we have to concede that the No. 1 pizza in New York is no longer Italian-American, but straight out of Naples. So much for 100 years of local tradition. Not only that, the top pie is made by a former cheese salesman from Italy named Roberto Caporuscio, who in his spare time serves as the American-chapter president of the Associazone Pizzaiouli Napoletana (an organization dedicated to teaching any pizza maker with ten days’ time and $4,000 to spare the error of his ways).
Domaine Badoz Crémant du Jura Rosé Brut, France NV (£19.90, The Sampler) I’ve never drunk pink champagne on Valentine’s Day, but judging by the various promotions on the stuff in the shops, quite a few people do, and there are worse ways of spending Tuesday evening than sharing a bottle of one the classics of the genre: the graceful Laurent-Perrier Cuvée Rosé Brut NV (down to £43.99 from £58.99, Waitrose) or the gossamer, soft, red-berry prettiness of Billecart-Salmon Rosé NV (from £60, Laithwaites).
Predicting the future of mobiles is easy -- devices will get thinner and Steve Jobs will get richer. For a more optimistic vision of the future of mobile phones, read our list of probable prophecies. Haptic technology was all the rage a year or two ago, and what did we get out of it? Touchscreens that buzz a little when you press them. Wow. The next generation of touchy-feely gadgets won't be quite as underwhelming, if Intel has anything to do with it. The chip company just demonstrated the first system that can simulate different kinds of springs using miniature actuators and software.

Prague, July 31 (CTK) - Some 150 people took part in a protest march against violence and discrimination against the Roma community in the Czech Republic, Italy and Ukraine that was held in Prague on Tuesday. The people gathered at the Letna plain and they walked to the seat of the Ukrainian embassy. Outside the embassy, they read out a statement recalling the violence against Roma people that occurred in Ukraine this year and the repressive steps recently taken by the Italian government. The protesters called on Czech, Italian and Ukrainian authorities and the EU to face xenophobia and racism.
It shouldn't come as too much of a shock that many Americans aren't saving as much as they should be for their retirement; but the magnitude of the situation may be surprising. According to a recent report, the shortfall -- that is, the gap between what Americans have saved and what they should have in savings -- could be as high as $14 trillion. Here's how to play catch-up if you've fallen behind. In a study conducted by the National Institute on Retirement Security (NIRS), Americans' retirement shortfall is $14 trillion, based on the current balances of retirement accounts.
A professor at the University of Michigan says Ariana Grande can teach Secretary of Defense James Mattis about counterterrorism operations against the Islamic State. Juan Cole of the Center for Middle Eastern and North African Studies at the University of Michigan published an op-ed this week in which he compares the anti-terrorism philosophies of Mr. Mattis, the former head of U.S. Central Command with over 40 years of military experience, to the singer behind the "Dangerous Woman" album. Ms. Grande's message of "inclusiveness" following the Manchester, England, terror attack after one of her concerts won out over Mr. Mattis' "kill them all" approach.
Members of the Chamber of Commerce in American Samoa are bracing themselves for increased costs but support the government in its revenue raising efforts. The territory is facing a projected 7.2 million US dollar shortfall in the payroll from reduced excise, individual and corporate taxes in an effort to stave off a reduction in work hours for government employees or cutting staff numbers. The chamber's chairman, David Whitby, says either way, it will mean further increases for many businesses which have been struggling over the past year to recover from the 2009 September tsunami, and the economic impact of reduced cannery operations and an increased minimum wage.
Men who developed persistent sexual side effects while on finasteride (Propecia), a drug commonly used for male pattern hair loss, have a high prevalence of depression and suicidal thoughts, according to a new study from researchers at George Washington University. For the study, Dr. Michael Irwig, an assistant professor of medicine, interviewed 61 men who were former users of finasteride with persistent sexual side effects for more than three months. The interviews gathered demographic information, medical and psychiatric histories, and information on medication use, sexual function, and alcohol consumption.
HOUSTON (NBC News) -- A Texas man who entered an abandoned home to smoke marijuana on Monday found a tiger in the garage, according to authorities. NBC affiliate KPRC report that police say the man, who was not identified, initially believed he was hallucinating when he found the female tiger in a “rinky-dink” cage. The garage,which is in a home southeast of central Houston, was secured only with a screwdriver and a nylon strap, the station reported. It wasn’t immediately clear who the tiger belonged to.

As many as half of publicly traded commodity shipping lines may breach their loan covenants by April after a record collapse in hire rates, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group, the third-largest lender to the industry. The cost of second-hand capesizes, the largest group of commodity carriers, plunged 70 per cent last year, according to the Baltic Exchange in London. Fleet values are one of the key covenants used. Banks review loans as often as every quarter, Lambros Varnavides, the bank&apos;s head of credit to the shipping industry, said in London on January 12 and January 13.

The "Outnumbered" panel on Tuesday reacted to reports that North Korea is moving ahead with its ballistic missile program at more than a dozen hidden bases. "Satellite images suggest that the North has been engaged in a great deception: It has offered to dismantle a major launching site — a step it began, then halted — while continuing to make improvements at more than a dozen others that would bolster launches of conventional and nuclear warheads," the New York Times reported, referring to a think tank's analysis of satellite images. The story in the New York Times concerning North Korea developing missile bases is inaccurate.
I felt like Daddy Warbucks (or perhaps more like his female counterpart Grace) the other evening as I led Anna Lee up the carpeted stairs and into the regal magnificence of Prague's Národní divadlo. Dressed in her holiday finest down to her shiny patent leather shoes, blond hair slightly askew, Anna looked every bit as wide-eyed as the orphan Annie had in the unforgettable scene from the 1980s movie Annie. When billionaire Warbucks took the night off and rented out the theater so that he could take Annie to see the stars, it was a night to remember.
MOSES' FINAL BLESSING ON the tribe of Benjamin is timeless, really. "The beloved of the Lord" includes us all. And this assurance seems especially needed now, following last week's massacre in a Colorado high school. Notice, this biblical prayer speaks to who we really are: loved of God. And it spells out where we really are: between His shoulders, in God's safe presence. This is as true of those who died as it is of those who survived. Of course, this promise of safety stands at odds with last week's tragedy.
Dozens of mummified mice have been discovered among about 50 animals found in an ancient tomb that was unveiled in Egypt on Friday. The well preserved and finely painted tomb discovered near the Egyptian town of Sohag, a desert area near the Nile about 390km south of Cairo, is thought to be from the early Ptolemaic period, dating back nearly 2,000 years ago. The tomb was built for a man named Tutu and his wife, and is one of the seven discovered in the area last October, when authorities found smugglers digging illegally for artefacts, officials said.
In the backdrop of reports of threats issued to Kashmiris based out of Jammu and Kashmir following the Pulwama terror attack, a Srinagar-based CRPF helpline on Saturday asked them to approach it in case they face any harassment. The 'Madadgaar' helpline posted a tweet in this context stating that Kashmiri students and the general public who are presently out of the state can contact it over the Twitter handle '@CRPFmadadgaar'. They can call on 24x7 toll-free number 14411 or send an SMS at mobile no: 7082814411 "for speedy assistance in case they face any difficulties or harassment".

Drake is having a huge week. Not only is he going public with his J.Lo relationship, but he’s also reached a historic milestone on the Billboard Hot 100, tying Lil Wayne for most appearances ever on the chart among soloists. This week, his new Gucci Mane collaboration “Both” debuted at No. 41, marking his 132nd time on the Hot 100, a chart with history that dates back to 1958. Only the “Glee” cast has more appearances on the chart with 207, an achievement reached by the Fox show’s rotating cast of characters from 2009-2015.

The FBI's failure to secure its case files made it possible for Robert Hanssen to'freely and without detection'gain access to data for his espionage activities, a new report concludes. What's more, according to the independent commission that conducted the review, the FBI still fails to adequately control its case files. But the commission also found that after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks'eight months after Hanssen's arrest'senior FBI officials lifted many access restrictions to the bureau's Automated Case Support system, a primary source of Hanssen's stolen information. The restrictions apparently slowed investigation of the World Trade Center and Pentagon bombings.
Gandhi's attack came over a media report on politicians and adivasi groups asking the Centre if it wants to "sacrifice" the forest law. Congress president Rahul Gandhi on February 14 alleged that the BJP was standing as a "silent spectator" in the face of the Forest Rights Act being challenged in the Supreme Court. He also claimed that this was indicative of the ruling party's "intentions" to drive out lakhs of tribals and poor farmers from forests. "The BJP is standing as a silent spectator in the Supreme Court, where the Forest Rights Act is being challenged.
Madonna always has been — and always will be! — the H.B.I.C. Before Nicki Minaj joined her onstage during Super Bowl XLVI on February 5, the 53-year-old Material Girl personally approved every aspect of the rapper&apos;s look. "Madonna was the first person in history who was able to make me change my wig," Minaj, 29, said on Ryan Seacrest&apos;s KIIS-FM radio show Monday. "I had some choices in terms of color, but. . . she has a way with words."
This year marks 60 years since the United States started sending satellites into space, and during that span, we have led extraordinary scientific discovery across our solar system. But our space exploration has taken a toll on one particular thing: the orbital environment. There is a lot of debris orbiting Earth. And if we don't do anything about it, we will see an increase in collisions to the detriment of space operations, space commerce and space exploration. The U.S. Strategic Command currently tracks and maintains knowledge of approximately 23,000 things in orbit, so-called resident space objects.

Kash Delano Register begins to cry as he realizes he will be a free man; with him are his lawyers, Lara Bazelon, left, Laurie Levenson, second from left, and Adam Grant, right, with the Loyola School of Law. In 1979, Brenda Anderson testified that a young man with whom she had gone to high school shot her elderly neighbor to death. Thirty-four years later, Anderson's sister Sharon took the stand and said the account, which helped send the young man to prison, was a lie.
New York - Joel Sajiun is one of the lead performers of "Men of The Strip." He sat down and chatted with me at Gramercy Theatre in New York City, prior to their show on December 17. This male revue is hosted by Jeff Timmons from the Grammy-nominated vocal group 98 Degrees and it is choreographed and directed by Emmy nominee Glenn Douglas Packard. Garo Bechirian from "Men of The Strip" served as the emcee at this show. Joel praised New York's Gramercy Theatre for being a "magnificent place."
Animal rights activists hoping to stop the sale of foie gras at restaurants and hotels in Arundel took to the high street this weekend for an awareness raising event. The day of action organised by local campaigner Wendy Lockwood on Saturday was arranged to coincide with a national protest organised by animal protection group Animal Equality. The group has launched a petition calling for the government to ban the import of foie gras, which is made of the liver of a duck or goose that has been specially fattened, after its investigations revealed the ‘extreme suffering’ of animals on foie gras farms in France and Spain.
A Rifle Police Officer initiated a traffic stop May 14 after noticing a red vehicle traveling 15 miles faster than the speed limit. The officer said he started following the vehicle at about 1:50 a.m. It swerved over the emergency lane repeatedly. The officer said he turned on his emergency overhead lights and the driver slammed on the car’s brakes, swerving onto and off of the highway’s exit ramp before finally coming to a stop. The officer said he observed the driver and passenger switch seats before making contact with the vehicle, adding the suspicious behavior prompted him to call for backup.
The changes at Cond? Nast continued unabated on Tuesday. Ari Brandt will remain general manager of the site, overseeing its business. Carey compared the structure to that of Wired, which was placed under his purview last week, and which has a Web site editor who works both with Wired editor in chief Chris Anderson and CondeNet president Sarah Chubb. The New York Observer reported in December, and sources at Portfolio confirmed, that Colarusso had been interviewing for the position of Portfolio.com editor in early 2007, just before he was promoted to the Post’s city editor.
Exclusive: Listen to Frontier Ruckus' New Single "Positively Freaking"
I remember learning the word “anxiety” as an 8-year-old—riding with my mom across the Michigan state line once a week for her to attend a group therapy seminar in Toledo. She brought home a collection of self-help cassettes that foreshadowed a world of adult gravity that, at the time, I couldn’t for the life of me comprehend. “Positively Freaking,” like much of Enter the Kingdom, catalogs that universal, inevitable divorce from childhood wonder. Grandparents and pets, the mascots of youth, dying off one by one.
A bill being considered in the Iowa Legislature could make it a crime for young people to come home and surprise mom and dad with a nose ring. House File 33, sponsored by Rep. Kevin Koester, R-Ankeny, would require parental consent for those younger than 18 seeking any non-earlobe body piercing, making the violation a simple misdemeanor for both the piercing specialist and the person receiving the piercing. "Even minors have the right to freedom of expression," said Daniel Zeno, a lobbyist with the American Civil Liberties Union who spoke against the legislation.
Following the truly unfortunate news that a contestant on the French version of Survivor, Koh Lanta, died during production of the series' thirteenth season, comes word that the doctor who treated the man has committed suicide, following what he says were unjust accusations. We learned last week that Koh Lanta was being cancelled for the season following the death of 25-year-old Gerald Babin, who complained of arm cramps not long after the group jumped from the boat to swim to the island, and engaged in a game of tug-of-war. The contestant was reportedly airlifted to a hospital but he suffered a series of cardiac arrests and died.
The follow-up to Brantley Gilbert's chart-topping single 'Country Must Be Country Wide' allows the singer to show a dark vulnerability that is sure to make him a more appealing artist to country music fans who may be turned off by his brand of country rock. 'You Don't Know Her Like I Do' is sentimental without being sissy. Gilbert wrote or co-wrote all of the songs on his 'Halfway to Heaven' album, often drawing from personal experience. This mid-tempo cut about heartbreak feels genuine, though a little rushed. More time was needed to turn his pain into artistry.
Some Forest Grove High School students got the chance to share their own ideas with Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici on Wednesday. Bonamici visited six schools in Columbia and Washington counties March 19, making a stop at the 4-H Tech Wizards after-school program at Forest Grove High School.

DURBAN - Global sensation Akon has announced that he will be launching his own cryptocurrency called Akoin. The rapper who made at the announcement at the Cannes Lion festival also announced his strategy to better the conditions in Africa. According to Akon, blockchain technology will help improve the conditions in Africa.

He added that it allows people to use in a way that they can improve themselves and not allow the government to do things that are keeping them down.
The latest word on the Apple smart watch is that it could include one or more interesting charging methods. There is still no official word from Apple on what its new watch will be like, when it will be released or what it will be called. Heck, the thing might not even exist. However, that hasn’t stopped rumours of the iWatch (as some people are guessing it will be called) coming thick and fast. The latest one suggests that you will be able to use the watch without ever plugging it in to charge it.
New developments in laser technology could see nuclear fusion as a viable power source within 15 years. Clean, cheap nuclear energy is often touted as a means to battle climate change. But how close are we to having nuclear plants that fit the clean, green bill? What are the different technologies and what do they offer? More than 10 per cent of the world's electricity currently comes from nuclear power plants. These existing plants all rely on nuclear fission — a chain reaction where uranium atoms are split to release extraordinary amounts of energy and, unfortunately, high levels of radioactive waste.

Budget — or — How Alice Can Buy Ads to Track Bob at the Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society in Dallas; the paper details a novel way that stalkers and other low-level criminals can accomplish state-grade surveillance on the cheap with targeted ad-purchases. The attack relies on the fact that major "Demand Side Platform" ad brokers like Google Adwords allow you to target an ad to a specific place and a specific person. By placing ads that only get served if a target is on a given block, the attacker can trace the target's movements in space and time.

Cannabis smoke is not as carcinogenic as tobacco smoke. In a review article published today in Harm Reduction Journal, Dr. Melamede from the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, USA, writes that although cannabis smoke and tobacco smoke are chemically very similar, evidence suggests that their effects are very different and that cannabis smoke is less carcinogenic than tobacco smoke. The pharmacological effects of tobacco and cannabis smoke differ in many ways, mainly because tobacco smoke contains nicotine while cannabis smoke contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The cancer-promoting effects of smoke are increased by nicotine, while they are reduced by THC.

The United States Bishops’ Catholic Campaign for Human Development has announced its 2014 grants. Our news story summarizing the grants suggests that a very large number of them fund political advocacy. It would be very interesting to know what percentage. As compared with what? Well, as compared with direct charitable activities in which Catholics help those in need to adopt the values required for human well-being, acquire the education and formation necessary to spiritual and material success, develop the habits and infrastructures necessary for economic and community development, and fund specific initiatives (such as new businesses) which put people to work.
Thanks to the AFA breaking the story and cranking up the heat on the U.S. military, the Pentagon is now scrambling to unblock the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) website on military computers. The reason given by the military's IT unit for the original blockage is that the SBC website contained "hostile content." The Pentagon has since claimed the blockage was due to the detection of malware on the SBC website. This may be so. Pentagon officials have stumbled all over themselves trying to deflect the accusation that the occlusion represented an expression of anti-Christian bias.
ITASCA – Itasca resident and father Brian Emmett won the CBS reality show “The American Baking Competition” on July 10. From Feb. 28 to March 27, 10 amateur bakers from across the country presented their confections to judges Marcela Valladolid and Paul Hollywood in North Georgia.

What does the world of everyday physics look like? From tracking your every breath, to getting frizzy hair when it's hot - physics is everywhere. But girls who take A-level physics only account for 21.5% of entries in Wales, according to Stats Wales. A new Physics Mentoring Programme aims to increase the subject's take up at A-level, particularly among girls. Students from five Welsh universities will be mentoring hundreds of pupils studying GCSE physics across Wales. Aberystwyth University physicist Carys Huntly said she had come across misunderstandings about who studies physics and what it is about.

Indiana National Guard members have been sent to North Carolina to help with relief efforts after the deadly Hurricane Florence ravaged the region. Gov. Eric Holcomb activated the armed force, which has responded to both Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma, to support victims of last week's storm, Maj. Gen. Courtney Carr said in a news release Wednesday. Hurricane Florence is responsible for at least 37 deaths in the Carolinas and Virginia, officials said.
Most Americans believe transgender people should be allowed to serve in the U.S. military, according to a new poll. The findings come after President Donald Trump decided to bar transgender people from military service. A Quinnipiac University national poll released Thursday found that 68% of American voters think that transgender people should be allowed to serve. That’s including 55% of voters in military households who support transgender service, according to the poll.

Things got a little heated on Wednesday’s Good Morning Britain as Piers Morgan’s views on feminism were challenged by co-host Charlotte Hawkins. The debate sparked up as the show ran a poll among its viewers asking how many of them identified as a feminist – with Charlotte expressing surprise that the majority of respondents said they were not. And as she began to say there was ‘no excuse’ for not being feminist, and Piers attempted to join in the conversation, she abruptly shut him down in order to make her views known.
For a few nights over the upcoming week, the past and present of the Riverdale Rising Stars will unite on one stage. Laurie Walton, the acclaimed theater company’s founder and director at the Riverdale YM-YWHA, has gathered a cast of 17 talented performers — a mix of current members and graduates of the program — for a special production of Stephen Sondheim’s A Little Night Music. Ben Becher and Emily Walton, long considered the “faces of the Rising Stars program,” head the list of alumni who will return to the stage where they have performed since their early teenage years.
IF we had a consumer confidence index for world events, as we do for the economy, its graph would have zigzagged sharply downward in recent weeks. In doing so, it would have dropped far beyond what any rational analysis of events called for. Fear hasn't exactly been in the saddle, but its foot was in the stirrup. The Western world -- particularly America -- has just gone through one of those periods when large numbers of its citizens seem almost to enjoy talking up their fears -- of terrorism, of travel abroad, of radioactive fallout, of unfair trading partners.
Oscar-nominated BlacKkKlansman co-writers Charlie Wachtel and David Rabinowitz are teaming with Gunpoweder & Sky to develop Madness, a TV drama series set in the world of college basketball. The series will follow the corrupt inner workings of a prestigious college basketball program through the eyes of its new assistant coach. Producers said that with a House of Cards feel, Madness reveals the repercussions the team must face after their head coach makes a bad deal. The project joins Gunpowder & Sky’s TV development slate that includes Shirmp, with Zelda Williams adapting her short film.
To indicate that you are fed up or that you've had it up to here with something, the French phrasebook says, hold your hand up to your forehead as if shielding your eyes from the sun, and drag it across your forehead while saying "J'en ai ras le bol!" That, in a nutshell, is what the French have just done in municipal elections which swept the Socialists from power in 155 cities across France, handing a large victory to the mainstream right and a smaller but still significant victory to the National Front.
Belfast Star coach Darren O'Neill hopes a round of golf in Killarney will ease his mind after a "baffling" defeat away to Cork side Demons, 83-66. At the break, Star seemed to be on course for one of their best wins of the season. A fine first half display, lit up by 23 points from Aidan Quinn, had given them a 10-point lead, 47-37 - and then the wheels came off. It didn't help that American DeAngelo Grier, who had looked so promising, came up with another dreadful shooting display - finishing with a paltry 12 points.
Bexhill and Battle MP Huw Merriman has revealed that he voted for the UK to remain in the EU yesterday. Mr Merriman was the only Sussex MP who went into the referendum without publicly declaring a position. He said: “After chairing debates, listening to the arguments and explaining both sides at over 30 public meetings and schools in the constituency, I have cast my vote in the EU Referendum and the polls are now closed. “I want to thank all members of the community who have spoken and engaged in the democratic process.
Well, that didn't take a long. The inevitable Rob Ford joke at the IndyCar Honda Toronto race this weekend, I mean. A deluge of rain in Toronto today led to a delay in the afternoon's race, and it also got the better of this Honda Accord pace car driver. He lost it in a turn and bumped the wall with the car's rear bumper. "You didn't give the keys to Mayor Ford, did you?" Bob Varsha says to Paul Tracy, who took hizzoner the mayor out in that same car earlier in the day.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has collected extensive information on the tactics, training and organization of antiwar demonstrators and has advised local law enforcement officials to report any suspicious activity at protests to its counterterrorism squads, according to interviews and a confidential bureau memorandum. The memorandum, which the bureau sent to local law enforcement agencies last month in advance of antiwar demonstrations in Washington and San Francisco, detailed how protesters have sometimes used ''training camps'' to rehearse for demonstrations, the Internet to raise money and gas masks to defend against tear gas.

Brazil's currency -- the real, or plural reais -- exchanged for roughly 64 U.S. cents in August 2011. The U.S. State Department warns about rampant street crime in Brazil, so you should avoid carrying large sums of cash there, especially at night. Be particularly careful when withdrawing cash from ATMs, as targeted robberies occur frequently. The people populating the land that is present-day Brazil did not use money until the arrival of Europeans. European colonists with commercial interests in the country wanted coins for transactions, leading to the beginnings of the Brazilian banking system.

Matchups were released Sunday night for the 256 teams that qualified for the high school football playoffs with three city teams and seven more area squads getting their ticket to the postseason.
Even a team as inept as the Clippers was able to do the right thing Thursday night. The Clippers made Blake Griffin, a 6-foot-10 power forward from Oklahoma, the No. 1 player taken in the NBA draft. Griffin, widely considered to be the best player on the board, should be able to make an immediate impact in an organization that has had just two winning seasons in the last 30 years. "That's just history, that's in the past," Griffin said when asked if he was concerned about going to a franchise that has had such a consistent lack of success.
In the weeks leading into the academic year, UCLA cross country runners were given the chance to train like professional athletes. Every year, the team engages in a three-week training camp at Mammoth Lakes, California, for a chance to train at altitude. Redshirt sophomore Tyler Janes said the goal of the camp is to bring the team closer together. In addition to the friendly competitions outside of practice, the team also builds confidence and chemistry during its intrasquad competitions.

Jerusalem -- In the early morning hours of 20 May, Israeli military forces broke into and occupied UNRWA's Jenin Camp Reconstruction Project Office near Jenin camp in the West Bank. A shot was fired in the direction of UNRWA's senior project manager, Mr. Paul Wolstenholme, as he attempted to gain access to the office, but fortunately he remained unharmed.

Mr. Wolstenholme, who attempted to convince the soldiers to leave the UNRWA installation, was not only detained for over three hours and threatened with physical violence, but was handcuffed and blindfolded as well.
Marion Anthony Gales, who did yard work for Thomas, was another suspect. He denied that he committed the crime. Police never charged him. But Friedland filed a wrongful death lawsuit in civil court against Gales, alleging that Gales had killed his wife. A jury in 1997 agreed and ordered Gales to pay Friedland $8.6 million. Gales is in prison for voluntary manslaughter in the death of LaCoya Monique Martin, whose shirtless body was found face down beside a house on Oaklawn Avenue in Charlotte on April 6, 2008. He will remain behind bars until 2025.
Charles Shrem, an outspoken proponent of Bitcoin who has come to symbolize the government’s crackdown on the virtual currency, pleaded guilty on Thursday to one count of aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business. Mr. Shrem was arrested in January and was accused of using his company to convert dollars into Bitcoin for users of Silk Road, the now-defunct online marketplace known for selling narcotics and drug paraphernalia. Federal prosecutors contend that he operated the scheme in cooperation with Robert Faiella, known as BTCKing. Mr. Faiella also pleaded guilty on Thursday to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.
The seductive pull of the Finger Lakes wine region beckons in all seasons, and the wineries are close enough that it only takes a few hours to get a taste of what the world is talking about. Casa Larga Vineyards in Fairport is the closest, and just won Best Dessert Wine at the Florida International Wine Competition. The March 2007 National Geographic Traveler paid compliment to the Finger Lakes’ “long vistas of blue water” and “wines that stand alongside California’s best.” The Finger Lakes have been featured on the cover of the Wine Spectator and in numerous trade magazines and wine books.
President Nixon had prepared a speech he would have given if the Apollo 11 mission had ended in tragedy. Fortunately, it didn't. But, says disaster expert Lee Clarke, only by imagining catastrophe can we cope with it. On the night of July 20 1969, 500 million people tuned in to watch the first humans walk on the moon. During the historic broadcast, President Richard Nixon spoke to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. "Hello, Neil and Buzz, I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House," said Nixon drearily.

In a welcome U-turn, Kenya’s highway authority (KENHA) has admitted that it was wrong to forcibly evict more than one hundred people from an informal settlement and promised full redress to all those affected, said Amnesty International on the eve of World Habitat Day. Driven out for development: Forced evictions in Mombasa details the impact of a road expansion development on the informal settlements of Jomvu and Bangladesh. It also exposes the failure by three of the project’s funders - the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and the German Development Bank (KfW) - to comply with their responsibilities.
If you work for yourself you create job opportunities for others, these were words uttered by the multi-faceted artist from Grassy Park. Emile YX? Jansen and the team, have an upcoming project, which is a continuation of what he has done in the past. It is targeting school going boys and girls and they are planning on rolling it out as soon as the second term of school resumes.

Karelian bear dog 'Orca' is hot on the heels of a roughly 140-pound, 2-year-old male black bear during a release earlier this year off Kingsbury Grade. • Use bear resistant containers (BRCs) and place them outside at least 30 feet from the house so bears do not learn to associate the smells and food rewards with your home. • Use removable bird feeders (including hummingbird feeders) for temporary placement, or better yet, scatter bird seed on the ground, not in a container or in a pile. This way, bears and other animals like deer won’t be able to easily get it.
We probably should have seen it coming. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Tuesday applied her quick questioning style to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, leading the attorney general to say at one point, "I don't want to be rushed this fast. It makes me nervous." Social media blew up over their exchange. There goes McCain (who isn't on this committee) interrupting Kamala Harris again, and admonishing her to be nice. It's not a partisan statement to say that it is absurd and insulting that @KamalaHarris keeps getting interrupted.
Gov. Greg Abbott's decision to call an emergency election for ex-Rep. Blake Farenthold's Texas District 27 seat will get maybe six extra voting days. Gov. Greg Abbott has just wasted millions in hard campaign dollars that could be spent on other tough races across the country in November. The governor has called for an Emergency Special Election to fill the seat of Rep. Blake Farenthold, who resigned in early April. Texas already had its primary March 6. In that race, neither of the top two Republicans in this R+13 District reached 50 percent of the vote, forcing a runoff May 22.

As a busy mum-of-three - including a six-month-old baby - Holly Willoughby is grateful for any ‘me time’ she can get. So when she lands in the make-up chair for her new prime time show Play To The Whistle, it’s a chance for some much-needed pampering. “You go in and say, ‘Can you just pluck my eyebrows please?’, and things like that. I leave there feeling slightly normal again,” says the presenter, who’s on maternity leave from This Morning after giving birth to son Chester in September.
Akim Oda, Nov 9, GNA - The Presidential Candidate of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Professor Evans John Atta Mills, said on Monday that the main opposition Party would not support any plans to destabilise the country.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) The big plays that have eluded the 49ers most of this season showed up again, with Anquan Boldin and Torrey Smith leading the way against the very Baltimore Ravens team they helped lead to a Super Bowl victory against San Francisco three seasons ago. Colin Kaepernick, sporting a rare postgame tie and spectacles, is regaining some of his swagger. Even if the Niners are now just 2-4 after snapping a four-game losing streak in Sunday’s 25-20 win against the hapless Ravens. Kaepernick for one is sensing a shift as his team makes small strides each week.
A national scheme to turn around the lives of disadvantaged families has been defended locally, despite doubts over its effectiveness. Analysis by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) into phase one of the Government’s Troubled Families scheme was ‘unable to find consistent evidence that the programme had any significant or systematic impact’. But West Sussex County Council, whose own version of the scheme, ‘Think Family’, was adjudged to have helped turn around the lives of more than 1,000 families between 2012 and 2015, has highlighted the benefits of the scheme.

When the Justice Department is done violating journalists’ First Amendment rights, it looks like they’ll move on to employees’. In a chilling memo to DOJ staff, the Obama administration is warning managers that they’d better start embracing homosexuality — or else. The email, which a Justice employee leaked to Liberty Counsel, is a scary reminder of how far this administration will go to crush free speech and expression in America. DO use a transgender person’s chosen name and the pronoun that is consistent with the person’s self-identified gender.
It will go a long way to determining whether it's tacky or tasteful. When Carrie Aulenbacher turned 40, she didn’t want a big party. Instead, she opted for a cake from her husband and an afternoon visit from her mother and father. Secondhand gifts are standard practice in Aulenbacher’s family, but what she unwrapped was far beyond what she expected: a late 1970s palm-sized emergency sewing kit, a dozen plastic icicles and a broken plastic bead organizer, all presented in a cracked plastic tote. Giving secondhand gifts: Tacky or tasteful?
TORONTO — Federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer shrugged off suggestions Tuesday that Ontario’s premier was overshadowing him on matters of importance to the national Conservative cause, saying they simply shared common goals. Scheer faced pointed questions about Doug Ford’s political influence after meeting with the Progressive Conservative premier at Ontario’s legislature, where the pair discussed issues including their opposition to the federal Liberal carbon pricing plan. Ford has been a strong critic of the tax, launching a court challenge against it and raising his opposition to it during recent trips to meet with Conservative political leaders in Saskatchewan and Alberta.

In London, Builders Dig Deep To Offer More Room The high cost of housing is encouraging Londoners to build down instead of up. They're digging out basements to create underground mansions — often to neighbors' dismay. The high cost of housing is encouraging Londoners to build down instead of up.

The New York Times reports that the FBI launched a counterintelligence investigation into whether President Trump was working on behalf of Russia after Trump fired FBI director James Comey. Today, the president denied being under Russia's influence. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., tells Judy Woodruff whether he believes Trump and what we still don’t know about Trump’s meetings with Vladimir Putin. And a short time ago, I spoke with Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. He's vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. I started by asking him if he takes the president at his word that he hasn't worked for Russian interests.

An informative book about the creatures of the Australian Outback. Australian author Margot Finke’s new book Kangaroo Clues is a masterpiece. The picture book introduces the reader to the Australian outback. The story is about a kangaroo named Roo being pursued by dingoes. Learning about Roo’s world is very fascinating. The icing on the cake is when the author introduces other wildlife from the Australian Outback. I enjoyed learning about a kookaburra, an emu, a koala, an echidna, a frillneck lizard, a galah, a platypus, and a goanna.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (CN) — Citing “legal and ethical outrage” over Wells Fargo’s fake accounts scandal, California State Treasurer John Chiang said Wednesday that the Golden State will immediately suspend major aspects of its lucrative relationship with the beleaguered financial behemoth. Chiang, who oversees nearly $2 trillion in annual banking moves, issued lofty sanctions against Wells Fargo including the suspension of his office’s investments in all of the bank’s securities. California will also forgo using Wells Fargo as an underwriter for the sales of state bonds.
When you grab an over-the-counter pain reliever, the assumption is that it’s reasonably safe, but the line between a safe dose of acetaminophen and a toxic one is scarily narrow. A new study, published in the Journal of Hepatology, found that acetaminophen is responsible for a shocking 46 percent of liver failure cases and 100,000 calls to Poison Control every year. What is going on with acetaminophen? Why a prescription? Because of how easy it is to take too much, which results in serious liver damage. I first learned about how unsafe acetaminophen can be from an episode of Adam Ruins Everything.

Come July, Google Chrome will add stark security warnings that could turn business away from your website if it’s unencrypted. Specifically, Google will brand your site as “not secure” in the address bar of its popular web browser if it senses you’re operating without encryption. “Users presented with this warning will be less likely to interact with these sites or trust their content,” so it’s “imperative” that site operators get their websites encrypted, said Patrick Donahue, security engineering product lead at Cloudflare, a web services provider.
Sharon and Terry Cassady say their stretch of the South San Gabriel River has become a cesspool. "Stir up the algae that’s settled to the bottom, and it smells like sewer," said Terry Cassady, an environmental engineer with a background in selling equipment to water and wastewater treatment plants. In places, stagnant water is covered with algae. "We don’t let the grandkids get in the water anymore," said Sharon Cassady. The couple point the finger at the nearby Liberty Hill Wastewater Treatment Plant, which legally discharges effluent into the river.

Jon Lester had gone eight straight starts without a loss, but that doesn’t mean that the Red Sox left-hander was exactly racking up a ton of Cy Young votes. Quite the contrary, as demonstrated by his Monday night performance, a 7-3 loss to the visiting Chicago White Sox. Lester needed 127 pitches, three off his career high of 130 during his 2008 no-hitter against Kansas City, to go 52/3 innings and was ultimately done in by a two-run bloop double by Alexi Ramirez. In reality, he was done in by his own ineffectiveness.
Chrysanthemums have been used in herbal teas and medicine for millennia. 1 Do Mums Do Better in Sunlight or Shade? 4 Can I Plant My Potted Mums Outside? Hardy mums (Chrysanthemum morifolium) bloom throughout the fall. They require little maintenance and grow best in U.S. Department of Agriculture hardiness zones 5 through 9. They prefer well-draining, fertile and moist soil, in addition to full sunlight. They can be transplanted from pots to the ground in early spring after the first frost, giving them time to develop a full root system, or in the fall before the first frost.
November 18, 2012 (JUBA) - South Sudan has rescheduled plans to resume oil production and exports out of neighbouring Sudan, in order to reach an understanding with Khartoum over security issues, the head of the state-owned Nile Petroleum Corporation (NilePet), Paul Adong, said Sunday. South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir declared on 14 November that his country’s oil production will be restarted this week, nearly a year after suspending exports through Sudan over a dispute with Khartoum on transit fees for exporting the crude through the north’s pipelines.
If ever a group set out to be teeth-grindingly annoying it is Gorillaz, Damon Albarn's 'other' band. In fact they're less a band than a virtual supergroup comprising four cartoons conceived by the Blur frontman and his one-time flatmate, illustrator Jamie Hewlett. Worse, they labour under names like Noodle and 2D and converse in character when they give interviews, most of which boast little else save knowing doggerel. You couldn't make it up - except, sadly, someone has. Still, all of it would be just about forgivable had their eponymous debut been magnificent.
The storage industry and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are crafting energy consumption standards for enterprise storage as that part of the data center becomes a bigger target for questions about efficiency. On Thursday, the EPA will hold a public meeting here at Storage Networking World in Orlando to solicit input on its developing Energy Star Data Center Storage specification. It released Draft 1.0 of the standard on April 9 and plans to conduct more meetings to refine that document, which may be finished by the end of the year. Storage vendors will then be able to label their products as compliant with the energy-saving standard.

The United Nations has confirmed the release of all 45 Fijian peacekeepers who had been held for two weeks by the rebels in the Golan Heights on the Israeli-Syrian border.

Rumors have surfaced that Apple is planning to launch a cheaper version of its iPhone 4 device along with the iPhone 5. An unknown source sent an image of AT&T’s inventory list to Engadget, in which the US wireless carrier has listed a certain iPhone 4S White, indicating that the device may be released soon. The leaked list also contains Apple devices like the black and white iPhone 4 16GB and 32GB. The list fails to mention the storage capacity of the iPhone 4S White, however. It is widely believed that the company plans to launch two new iPhones in October.
CES attendees inspect Intel UltraBooks at the Las Vegas Convention Center. “We fundamentally believe that there’s a convergence happening between tablets and notebook,” Kirk Skaugen of Intel said. LAS VEGAS — Pity the poor laptop. The darling of the tech world just a couple of years ago, laptops have become one of the biggest casualties of the tablet phenomenon. For consumers enamored of touch-screen tablets, laptops suddenly seem like stale, clunky gadgets whose basic clamshell design hasn't changed all that much in two decades. It opens. It shuts. Yawn.
By , LONDON, January 20 – British luxury clothing brand Burberry said Tuesday it planned to eliminate up to 540 jobs in Britain and Spain as the global economic slowdown takes its toll. The company famed for its iconic trenchcoat said it would shut a sewing factory in Rotherham, northern England, and close its "underperforming" Thomas Burberry business in Spain. "Burberry will shortly be entering a consultation process in Spain, which could lead to around 250 redundancies," the group said in a statement.

The Lok Sabha Tuesday night finally approved a bill to create a Lokpal but a move to grant it constitutional status failed, leaving the government red-faced. The Lok Sabha Tuesday night finally approved a bill to create a Lokpal but a move to grant it constitutional status failed, leaving the government red-faced. In Mumbai, Anna Hazare refused to give up his three-day fast despite falling ill, but questions were raised about the future of his movement. It was a bitter finale to a day-long animated debate on the Lokpal bill, with Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee's passionate speech towards the end drowning much of the criticism from opposition MPs.
It’s hard to argue that more price transparency in healthcare isn’t needed – especially as employers increasingly shift to high-deductible plans and Health Savings Accounts that demand more responsibility from their employees. But a new study in the Journal of Consumer Research suggests that price transparency alone could lead consumers to risky conclusions about their need for certain medications and procedures. As part of the study, the researchers, Janet Schwartz of Tulane University’s A.B. Freeman School of Business and Adriana Samper of Arizona State University, gave two groups of people two different flu shot prices, $25 and $125.
HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — The ruling Communist Party of Vietnam disciplined the country’s communications minister Thursday for approving a mobile phone operator’s purchase of a stake in a private pay TV provider, a deal that caused serious financial losses to the state. Minister of Information and Communications Truong Minh Tuan was given a warning and removed as head of the ministry’s party organization following a meeting of the all-powerful Politburo chaired by General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, the party said on its website. Tuan signed the approval for the deal and other related documents that “go contrary to the regulations,” it said.

Yep, Fossil will release its first fashion smartwatch, an as-yet-unnamed Android Wear device, to market in October 2015. That's not the only product due either. A connected bracelet and a connected watch (not an Android Wear device, it seems) will make-up a trio of devices, as shown on stage at the forum by Greg McKelvey, Fossil Group's Executive Vice President.

We talked to Arlene [Klasky, co-creator], we talked to Nickelodeon, and we said, 'Let's do that she's divorced.' And they said, 'No, no, we don't want to touch divorce. That's too heavy a subject, we don't want to go there.' So we said, 'Okay... so... you know... that means... Chuckie's mom... is dead?' And they go, 'No! No! No! We definitely don't want to talk about that, that's scary!
Double Down Game Change 2012: Jon Huntsman's independent dreams, Michele Bachmann's migraines. Jon Huntsman and Michele Bachmann greet each other prior to a debate at Constitution Hall on Nov. 22, 2011, in Washington, D.C.
I’m coming out very shortly with a review of Double Down: Game Change 2012, the irritatingly titled campaign tell-all. Though I dreaded reliving that race as much as anyone, I would never deny the deep reporting of John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, and bow before the bizarre scoopage they’ve shown off here. Bachmann’s brain.

View drawings and descriptions in their own words from children who survived atrocities in Darfur from part of Human Rights Watch's "The Smallest Witnesses" exhibit. This excerpt excerpt from Worse Than War describes strategic political acts embedded in larger political contexts, practices, and goals that can eventually lead to genocide. Goldhagen was invited by the Singapore Mission on November 19, 2009 to present his book Worse Than War to members of the United Nations. Watch the presentation in this video. This section of Worse Than War examines evidence that the perpetrators of eliminationist campaigns live in a milieu over­whelmingly supporting and affirming their treatment of the victims.
The United States can't afford librarians, according to a new analysis of federal data. Between 1999-2000 and 2015-16, U.S. public schools lost 19% of full-time equivalent school librarians, according to a School Library Journal article by researcher Keith Curry Lance that examined National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data. The shortage in public school librarian employment — which saw the most dramatic drop following the Great Recession of 2008 and hasn't recovered since — has hit districts serving minorities the hardest. Among all the districts that have retained all their librarians since 2005, 75% are white, Education Week reports.
Raymond Owl, a First Nations elder and environmental activist, handles his hunting rifle in Sagamok Anishnawbek First Nation on Nov. 21, 2016. His organization, Traditional Ecological Knowledge Elders Group, wants an herbicide banned in traditional First Nations territory. When Raymond Owl hunts and forages for medicines in woodlands around his Northern Ontario First Nation, he routinely finds blistering, withered plants and seldom sees game. The forest is part of a tract of land sprayed with glyphosate, the active ingredient in an herbicide used to expedite the growth of coniferous trees after clear-cutting.
Michael Flynn, who resigned over contacts with Russian officials, wants protection against 'unfair prosecution'. Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has offered to testify before congressional committees probing potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia but wants protection against "unfair prosecution," his lawyer has said. Flynn was forced to resign as Trump's national security adviser in February over contacts with Russian officials. "General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit," said a statement on Thursday from Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner.
A mother-of-two has revealed how suffering a miscarriage inspired her to transform her life and lose a whopping 155lbs. Francesca Lara, 31, from Texas, weighed 368lbs when she suffered a miscarriage in November 2016. 'After that, I felt an extreme sense of guilt. I couldn't help but think that the miscarriage was related to my size or health,' she told Popsugar. The mother-of-two explained that she was hospitalized during most of her second pregnancy, and she thought her third pregnancy was bound to be worse because she was larger and older.
BEIJING - China’s economy grew at a forecast-beating 6.9 per cent last year as it rebounded from the 26-year low of 6.7 per cent in 2016. The recovery was helped by stronger global trade that boosted exports and strengthened the manufacturing sector, say analysts. Robust consumer spending and the effects of supply-side reform measures that began in 2015 also played a big part, they add. Analysts are forecasting growth of between 6.4 per cent and 6.7 per cent for this year. They see few risks to the economy although there are some concerns over escalating corporate debt and trade tensions with the United States.
The Public Protector has confirmed that Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA), Des van Rooyen, lied to parliament when he denied visiting the Gupta’s compound in Saxonwold in the run-up to his disastrous appointment as Finance Minister. - Minister van Rooyen’s conduct was also in violation of section 96(1) and 96(2)(b) of the Constitution.

What if it is only folklore? What if girls are adept and clamoring to be in STEM classes and women, in STEM fields? Daniel and Susan Voyer just released their study Gender Differences in Scholastic Achievement: A Meta-Analysis in the Psychological Bulletin. They raise doubts that about the generally accepted belief that girls are not interested in science and math. They turn it into an urban legend. The meta-analysis asked and answered questions about the generally reported STEM gap between genders from elementary school through the university. "The largest effects were observed for language courses, and the smallest gender differences were obtained in math courses.
With the reach of U.S. surveillance now global and with the U.S. military deployed all over the world anger at President Obama’s unprecedented crackdown on whistleblowers who disclose the U.S. government’s abuses and crimes has gone international, as this Norwegian opinion piece by Victor Wallis shows. The more extreme the crimes of state, the more the state seeks to shroud them in secrecy. The greater the secrecy and the accompanying lies, the more vital becomes the role of whistleblowers and the more vindictive becomes the state in its pursuit of them. Whistleblowers are people who start out as loyal servants of the state.
Amazon.com Inc. said Tuesday that second-quarter earnings plunged nearly 58 percent as the online retailer focused on investing in a shipping deal and new technologies.

Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad arrived at the start of a tour to shore up support from the region's leftist leaders, as tough new Western sanctions aim to isolate the Islamic republic and target its vital oil exports.
On the show today, we hear new music from “outlaw” Shooter Jennings. And, we answer a question about the meaning of Washington, DC. But first we here about a public showing in that city of a very old and important object. In 1879, British scientists discovered an important, ancient object at an archaeological dig in what is now Iraq. The small, simple clay cylinder is covered in cuneiform writing. Many experts believe the writing is the world’s first declaration of human rights. The cylinder is now on display for the first time in Washington, DC.

Joey Davidson was on hand to put a well placed drag flick into the corner to level the match.
Kremlinology was more fun when it meant deciphering other countries’ Kremlins and not our own. For those inclined to palace intrigue, Steve Bannon’s removal from the national security council (NSC) could mean any number of things – the triumph of Jared Kushner’s business wing over Bannon’s ethno-nationalist wing, the consolidation of power by national security adviser HR McMaster, President Trump being mad about something on Twitter – but the most absurd explanation is what’s already being touted in the media as a “shift towards normalcy”.
ARM has shared part of the Always connected PC roadmap that is currently only executed by Qualcomm Snapdragon, and also showed some expected performance projections of the 7nm and 5nm parts. Currently the Snapdragon 850 that just became available with Samsung Galaxy Book 2 launched yesterday and Lenovo Yoga C630 machines are powered by Kryo cores based on Cortex A75. Based on SpecIntl 2K6 ARM/Snapdragon is expecting to catch up with Core i5 7300 performance in this single thread benchmark with the next generation, and probably exceed it.

The weekend analysis of the Bears' first preseason game seems to have taken on life-and-death significance. Television and radio sports talk show hosts fielded impassioned comments, dissected every play and fueled arguments regarding the Bears' lackluster victory over the expansion Carolina Panthers. Meanwhile, the mind of veteran Bears cornerback Donnell Woolford remains fixed on a real-life tragedy. "My niece died at about 3 o'clock in the morning. She got killed in a high-speed car chase during a bank robbery," Woolford said Friday night after the last wave of reporters had quizzed him about the progress of the Bears' secondary.

Originally from Quebec, Marc J. Philippon has a passion for hockey but has worked on the hips of athletes ranging from skiing gold medalist Julia Mancuso to two-time British Open champion Greg Norman. March 4, 2009 — Editor's note: This 2006 story profiling Marc Philippon soon after he moved to Vail from Pittsburgh underscores the skills and the clientele the Quebec native brought with him to Vail's renowned Steadman-Hawkins Clinic.

An architect’s rendering of what a new Dighton-Berkley bridge might look like was both rewarding and exciting. The wait for a new bridge has been long and frustrating. As the old span fell bit by bit to the ravages of time, residents and non-residents who use the bridge daily got much less than what they should have received. That’s a way of saying that a new bridge should have been erected years ago. Each time the bridge failed an inspection and was classified as dangerous, the state made repairs with a patch here and a patch there, sometimes raising the weight limit.
Would Rupert Murdoch uphold the Dow Jones code of conduct? Can Murdoch Pass the Stink Test? Assessing the mogul against the standards of the Dow Jones code of conduct. Maintaining the heritage of independence and journalistic integrity of the Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones’ other publications would be of utmost importance to me and to News Corporation. That’s a lovely thought to express in the rutting heat of courtship, but could Murdoch be trusted to do the right thing once he became owner of the world’s leading financial daily and its sister publications?

CHELSEA could have a clear run at Torino star Andrea Belotti. At least that’s what Italian journalist Claudio Raimondi hinted during an appearance on Premium Sport HD. Belotti emerged as one of the world’s most promising attacking prospects by smashing in 28 goals in 38 games for Torino last season. And he’s started the new campaign in a similarly rich vein of form, scoring twice in four appearances for the Serie A side. Starsport understands Antonio Conte is interested in signing Belotti before the transfer window slams shut at 11pm next Thursday.

Company executive don't want marketing; they want sales. Or they want a twitter or Linkedin strategy. Or they want to increase channel sales. I get calls all the time asking for a "cheap website guy". You realize that your website is supposed to be your online presence hub, right? You realize that there is no "strategy" for a social network, right? You comprehend that twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Snap, Instagram, Pinterest, your blog - are all just publishing mediums that have replaced the billboard and the yellow page ad.

As I drove my mom’s car South from her home towards my son’s winery, I enjoyed the beauty of Eastern Washington while my mom read articles to me from the collection I’d recently added to Pocket. I didn’t expect her to be interested in the Pagan articles, but she surprised me by reading Echoes of an Older God, a post about Arthur as a Pagan deity. As she read that post and we drove through miles of wide open American land, my thoughts wandered off to the problem of colonialism, empire builders, and cultural destruction.
The world that Shooter Jennings has created in his ambitious new album, "Black Ribbons," is more ominous than brave and more nerve-rackingly familiar than new in presenting a scenario of the dark days ahead for humankind in the tradition of Aldous Huxley's classic 1932 novel. Yet the singer and songwriter, the maverick offspring of country music outlaws Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter, is putting his message across in myriad ways that Huxley wouldn't even have imagined in his treatise about a technological society in which there's little room for human connection.
Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans (white shirt) announcing his mayoral candidacy. D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans still has raised the most money of the candidates for mayor of Washington, and Councilmember Muriel Bowser still has the most left to spend. Both have a big lead on Mayor Vincent Gray, who just announced this month that he's seeking re-election and hasn't raised a penny so far. The Democratic primary is April 1. The candidates filed financial reports late Tuesday. Evans is the first candidate to top $1 million and has $582,000 left to spend.
Art can be found anywhere. And it doesn't have to be created with paint on canvas, sculpted from clay, or chiseled in stone. Sometimes all it takes is a simple piece of chalk and a public sidewalk. That's the theory behind the annual Chalk Art Festival, which is June 13 at the Uptown Shopping Center in Richland. Registration starts at 8 a.m. Chalkers will begin their work at 9 a.m. and continue until 3 p.m.
"Chalk art is a wonderful and unique form of creativity," said Gus Sako, the event's organizer and owner of the Octopus' Garden novelty store in the Uptown.
HOUSTON (AP) — A gunman who killed one person and wounded several others during a weekend attack that began at a Houston auto detail shop was an Army veteran from California who was haunted by his deployment in Afghanistan, his relatives said. Family members identified Dionisio Garza III, 25, of Rancho Cucamonga, California, as the man who opened fire Sunday morning, killing 56-year-old Eugene Linscomb, a customer who had arrived moments earlier at the shop. Garza, who was on foot, proceeded to spray the west Houston neighborhood with dozens of shots from what police said was an AR-15 style military rifle.
Do-it-yourselfers give their time and talents all year long. When it comes to giving back, there's no better time in home improvement history than the present. Advances in technology continue to deliver state-of-the-art tools and gadgets at prices more affordable than ever. Innovations range from something as simple as a knuckle-saving socket set to a waterproof micro inspection camera, for under $200. This year's "On The House DIY Gift Guide" could easily have rivaled "War and Peace." With space limitations we offer our Cliff Notes version. Happy Christmas shopping!
I'm not sure that there's anything in our society with quite as much unexamined cultural baggage as sports. The most literal understanding of the word may be where people start—individuals or teams competing in athletic games of skill—but we all come with their own idea of what sports means to us: local pride, tribal affiliation, patriarchal dominance, drinking, feats of physical dominance, being with friends, understanding the world through math, memories of family, gambling, or more. March Madness, the annual college basketball tournament, manages to bring a much different set of discussions and expectations than virtually every other kind of sports.
Riot police were quick to crack down on a march in Hledan market in Yangon, beating several protesters on March 10. A group of students and activists came onto the streets of Yangon at 2 pm in sympathy with the protesters who had been beaten in a melee of violence by police earlier in the day in Letpadan. About 1,000 students and activists took part in the protest, and the authorities used about 500 police to launch a crackdown. The protestors marched along Pyay Road. When they approached Sitepyoyay bus-stop, scuffles broke out between the protestors and the police. Some protestors were beaten.
When he went into business in 1958, art college graduate Ian Clarkson settled on a shop in West Bow, unable to afford premises in Princes Street or George Street. Sixty years on, he is delighted to be part of the fabric of one of the Capital’s most prestigious – and most photographed – thoroughfares. His shop, Clarksons, started life as an outlet for the work of fellow graduates and up-and-coming artists. It was not until the 1970s that he decided to focus on fine jewellery, selling the work of individual homegrown makers.
Oh, boy. Teen Mom 2 star Jenelle Evans has found herself in another sticky legal situation on Wednesday, May 27, according to TMZ. The reality star, 23, is wanted by the cops after her ex-fiance Nathan Griffith called the Myrtle Beach police in South Carolina on the mother of his son, Kaiser. TMZ reports that Evans allegedly attacked, choked, slapped, and punched 27-year-old Griffith and tried to kick him down a flight of stairs in his own home. According to the police report, Griffith had scratches and bruises all over his body.
Fare: Soup, salad, sandwiches and market plates with an emphasis on fresh produce, along with a respectable selection of gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan options.

KUALA LUMPUR- President Barack Obama arrived at the RMAF base in Subang on Saturday for the much-awaited three-day visit. U.S. President Barack Obama greets U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy (C) upon his arrival at Haneda International Airport in Tokyo April 23, 2014. Obama's arrival in Tokyo on Wednesday evening brought parts of the Japanese capital shuddering to a halt amid tight security. U.S. President Barack Obama shakes hands with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (R) at a joint news conference at the Akasaka Palace in Tokyo April 24.
Hamilton - Women who drink two large glasses of milk a day after their weight-lifting routine gained more muscle and lost more fat compared to women who drink sugar-based energy drinks, a McMaster study has found. The study appears in the June issue of Medicine and Science in Sport and Exercise. A previous study conducted by Phillips’ lab showed that milk increased muscle mass and fat loss in men. This new study, says Phillips was more challenging because women not only steer clear of resistance training they also tend to steer away from dairy products based on the incorrect belief that dairy foods are fattening.
Two New York University professors gave that argument substantial support in a brief they filed in the case. They showed that the office routinely refuses to register trademarks both by saying something is scandalous and, ironically, too confusingly similar to something that is already registered. For example, the office refused to register "FUK!T" for being scandalous and immoral but also confusingly similar to the already registered "PHUKIT." ''MIDDLEFINGER" was denied after "JONNY MIDDLEFINGER" was registered, and "Ko Kane" was rejected after "Kokanee" was registered.
The Colombian designer stuck to her ultrafeminine roots with ruffles, florals and bouffant sleeves. Johanna Ortiz produces all of the clothes for her burgeoning label at a facility in her native Cali, Colombia, and the romance and vivid colors associated with her country were never far away. For fall, Ortiz stayed true to her ultrafeminine, tropical roots with a lineup of glossy looks featuring cascading ruffles, floral prints and more than a couple of bouffant sleeves. “I wanted to mix the coolness of the Eighties with the glamour of the Thirties,” she said.
What Would God Say About Goldman? Three religious leaders on the going rate for doing "God's work." November 8, 2009 was almost certainly a terrible, terrible day for Goldman Sachs's (GS) PR team. That was the day The Sunday Times ran its infamous profile on Lloyd Blankfein during which the Goldman CEO said he was just a banker doing "God's work." As it turned out, a lot of people disagreed with Blankfein's assessment. To quell the outrage, Lucas van Praag, the bank's spokesman, said that the statement was "an obviously ironic, throwaway response."
A perennial bromide of business advice is "align sales and marketing." That advice is generally doled out with an accompanying dose of finger wags and tut-tuts about inter-departmental squabbling. However, my experience tells me that sales professionals aren't interested in "getting aligned" with marketing. Instead, they insist that marketing groups must undergo some major changes BEFORE they earn a seat at the table. With that in mind, here are the top ten complaints that I hear from sales professionals about respective marketing groups, along with suggestions (some from me, some from the sales pros) about what needs to change.
Aug. 9 (UPI) -- Britain's Conservative Party called Thursday for an investigation of former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, due to complaints about remarks he made about Muslim women wearing burqas. The party, also known as the Tories, said dozens of complaints about Johnson's comments will be investigated to see if they violated the party's code of conduct. An independent panel will conduct the inquiry, as the first step in a process that could lead to his expulsion from the party. That, however, would also need Prime Minister Theresa May's approval.
Lalu Yadav has asked to be moved to a 100-bed paying ward, which at present has only three patients, an RJD lawmaker said. Lalu Yadav surrendered on August 30 to a special CBI court in Ranchi. The RJD leader was moved to Room 11 on Wednesday night, RIMS Superintendent Vivek Kashyap told reporters on Thursday. He said permission was granted by the Superintendent of the Birsa Munda Central Jail to shift him. Rashtriya Janata Dal legislator Bhola Yadav had said on September 3 that Lalu Yadav was not able to sleep due to the barking of dogs and as a result his health was getting affected.
My daughter is very excited about Malala and she's really, really hoping for Malala to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which will be presented on October 11, 2013. (It seems tweens never singularly hope for anything.) Malala is the youngest-ever nominee. * How many times has the Nobel Peace Prize been given? This will be the 94th time the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded since 1901. The Peace Prize is one of five Nobel prizes awarded since that time. * What is the criteria for the award?

On December 9 2015, ANC backbencher Des van Rooyen was appointed finance minister. Four days later, after intense pressure, then-president Jacob Zuma rescinded his appointment, shifted him to the co-operative governance and traditional affairs department and appointed Pravin Gordhan to control the nation’s purse strings. Those few days were the culmination of years of reports about the influence of the Gupta family in running South Africa. To many, Van Rooyen, who had visited the Guptas’ Saxonwold compound seven days in a row before his appointment, represents the epitome of state capture.
TOKYO, March 22 (Reuters) - Asian shares hit 6-1/2-month highs on Friday after upbeat U.S. data and optimism in the tech sector lifted Wall Street stocks, helping calm some of the jitters sparked by the Federal Reserve’s cautious outlook on the world’s biggest economy. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent, led by 0.5 percent gains in the info tech sector, while Japan’s Nikkei bucked the trend and lost 0.2 percent. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index soared 3.5 percent, coming within a striking distance from its all-time high marked about a year ago.
Ipswich Town Hall was a hive of activity this weekend as a national gin festival returned for a second year. The event was very nearly a sell out and repeated on the success from last year. There were more 100 different types of gins on offer, as well as street food, live music and master-classes in mixing across the three-day event. Rosie Peters, front of house supervisor, said everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. “It’s been a great atmosphere, with beautiful weather,” she said. She added that organisers were hopeful that the event would return again next year.
It would be a second mistake for the State of New Hampshire to go with other states in repealing the death penalty. The first mistake was not making use of the penalty which is leading to its own demise. Think about it. The opioid crises is getting out of control, and nobody thinks the death penalty is a deterrent. I ask you how many times will a dead drug dealer continue to make money on drugs. I would use the death penalty, reduce death row time and wipe the dealers off the face of this country.
About Byrnes: The Rebels are trying to break a two-game losing skid in the state semifinals and make it back to the title game for the first time since 2011. Byrnes has scored 30 or more points in all but three games this season. Byrnes is led by another standout group of receivers for quarterback Micah Young to pass to. The Rebels are trying to avenge last year’s playoff loss to Dutch Fork. About Dutch Fork: The defending 4A Division I champions, the Silver Foxes allowed 19 or more points in each of their first four games (including giving up 58 and 49 in two losses).
ANAHEIM >> Mike Trout, who on Saturday spoke to the media for the first time since learning that he needed surgery to repair the thumb he injured on a head-first slide, had a definitive answer for your first question. No, he’s not going to stop sliding head first. Trout said he has tried to slide feet first, and it feels uncomfortable. He also said this is the first time he’s ever been hurt with a head-first slide. One concession he will make, though, is wearing a protective glove on his left hand when he returns.
Israel is ready to negotiate with the PA but it wants to impose preconditions, says Defense Minister during a talk in Washington. The so-called “Arab peace initiative” is a spin, Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon (Likud-Yisrael Beytenu) said on Friday. Speaking at the Washington Institute of Near East Policy, Yaalon said, "The Arab peace initiative is a spin. Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that Israel is ready to return to the negotiating table without preconditions and dictations, but the Arab initiative is a dictation - first we need to give up territory, then the Arabs would consider a relationship with us."
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has renewed an offer to cooperate with Russia in the Syrian conflict, including on military matters, ahead of President Donald Trump's meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin later this week. In a statement Wednesday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. is open to establishing no-fly zones in Syria in coordination with Russia as well as jointly setting up a truce monitoring and humanitarian aid delivery mechanism. The statement came as Trump prepared to meet with Putin on Friday in Germany and as the U.S. seeks to consolidate gains made against the Islamic State group in recent weeks and amid preparations for a post-IS future.

Just in time for finals, Mod of Cards: Episode 1 arrives. Thankfully, the crew behind the House of Cards inspired mini-series believe in a gentler method of distribution than Netflix. Instead of dropping 13 hours of television at the strike of midnight, director Derek Switaj, CSOM ’15, and Exposure Productions kindly dropped the first of six 30 minute episodes on Sunday night. Hopefully, some can take a break from papers and projects for a chance to see their friends and enemies scheme for power in the very halls we’ll walk this week.
Marli van Breda has yet to see her only surviving brother Henri after the axe attack in which her parents and other brother were murdered. Marli van Breda has yet to see her only surviving brother Henri after the axe attack in which her parents and other brother were murdered, Netwerk24 reported on Monday. Her father Martin, 54, mother Teresa, 55, and 22-year-old brother Rudi died in the January attack at their home at the De Zalze golf estate in Stellenbosch. Marli's legal representative, Debbie Wybrow, would not say why the two siblings hadn't met.
The new government of Sierra Leone under the leadership of Ernest Bai Koroma and his All People’s Congress (APC) party has been in power for a little over seven months. But the opposition Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) says it and Sierra Leoneans in general are disappointed with the way the country is being run under President Koroma. Jacob Jusu Saffa is the National Secretary General of the SLPP. He told VOA Sierra Leoneans are worried because the factors that led to the country’s brutal civil war from 1991 to 2002 are again being repeated by the Koroma government.
Letters and Priority Mail boxes would be affected if the USPS price increase goes into affect. The U.S. Postal Service is seeking to increase the price of its first-class mail forever stamp in the biggest price hike since 1991. The USPS board of governors requested a 5 cent increase to the forever stamp, up to 55 cents. Before recalculating the cost of sending those wedding invitations, USPS said the change would also reduce the additional ounce price of letters. So, a 2-ounce stamped letter would decrease from 71 cents to 70 cents, according to a statement.
Bodyguard star Richard Madden has spoken out against the "unrealistic" demands he and his fellow actors face regarding their weight and body image. "I've done numerous jobs where you're told to lose weight and get to the gym," he told British Vogue. "It doesn't just happen to women, it happens to men all the time as well." His comments follow singer Sam Smith's recent admission on Instagram that "I have starved myself for weeks" in advance of photo shoots. Smith's revelation was accompanied by a shirtless photo that was described as an effort to "reclaim my body".

US forces used napalm-like MK-77 firebombs against Iraqi forces in their drive toward Baghdad last spring, a Pentagon official confirmed today, defending their use as legal and necessary. US Marine Corps jets dropped the firebombs at least once in March to take out Iraqi positions at the town of Safwan just across the Kuwait border from the US-led invasion force, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "It is like this: you've got (an) enemy that's hard to get at. And it will save your own lives to use it, and there is no international contraventions against it," the official said.
Dear Ann Landers: I've been seeing "Charlie" for over a year and our relationship is fantastic. We get along beautifully and have a great deal in common. This man gives me love, support, understanding and companionship. Charlie is the man I have been waiting for all my life. There is, however, a problem. My parents hate him. My mother struggles to be civil to him, and my father won't allow Charlie's name to be mentioned in the house. I am beside myself trying to work this out and am having very little success.
Why should flatlanders pay more to protect homes on the fire-prone hillsides? Californians love to live close to nature, where the elements could easily wipe them out, and when state firefighters come to the rescue, they don’t leave a bill. But that may be about to change. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said last week he wants to add a fee of 1.25 percent to fire insurance premiums to help offset the cost of state firefighting, which last year was $1 billion and rising. But is such a fee smart?
QRCS-funded sewing workshops in Al-Quds. Qatar Red Crescent Society (QRCS) has completed an economic empowerment project for the needy Palestinian households in the City of Al-Quds, with a total budget of $282,000 (more than QR1mn).

The project effectively helps the households – with orphans and poor people – have a stable source of income, reduces poverty, raises living standards, and gives a boost to the local market.
It's a World Cup year! And there's no better way to get into the most popular sport on the planet than with the Chicago Fire's home opener against the New York Energy Drinks, the winners of the MLS Supporters' Shield last year (best regular season). Buy the scarf, learn the songs, take a cheap shuttle to the game (Globe Pub, Cleo's, and Galway Arms are all pick-up spots). Welsh-born, Chicago-based musician Jon Langford plays at Hideout tonight with his group Skull Orchard.
The national electoral trend – major population centers tend to vote Democratic, more rural areas tend to vote Republican – was certainly true in this year’s elections, especially in Wisconsin, where Dems swept all of the major races, fueled by high turnout in cities like Milwaukee and Madison. Some GOP leaders in the state have pointed to this dynamic as a rationale to defend their ridiculous power-grab. Robin Vos, the Republican speaker of the Wisconsin Statehouse, drew this distinction even more explicitly after the midterm election. It’s a jarring perspective.

In order to do a Peruvian restaurant, Culture Authentic Eatery owners Travis and Jody Wright went to Peru to get a sense of the cuisine. "If we're going to be authentic, we have to be authentic. We can't say that our Peruvian research was done in Arlington, Virginia." This story is part of a series called Culture Shark. Travis Wright may have grown up with pollo a la brasa in northern Virginia. But to think he and his wife, Jody, were going to open up a Peruvian rotisserie restaurant without actually going to Peru, that was not going to happen.
MADRID, Spain, Aug 9 – Thibaut Courtois said his move to Real Madrid from Chelsea was a “dream come true”, as he was unveiled by the European champions at the Santiago Bernabeu on Thursday. The 26-year-old goalkeeper joined Real for a reported fee of 35 million euros on a six-year deal, with midfielder Mateo Kovacic departing Madrid for Stamford Bridge on a season-long loan. “Today is a dream come true for me, you can’t imagine how happy I am,” said Courtois, who won the Golden Glove award as the World Cup’s best goalkeeper after helping Belgium finish third last month.
My name is Jeff Havens, and next November I’m asking the voters of Midland County’s District 5 to choose me to be their county commissioner. My opponent in the election is Jim Giesler, who has been District 5’s commissioner for the past eight years. Since I’m the newcomer, you might expect me to argue that Jim has been in his position for too long, or that he’s somehow out of touch with the real needs of Midland County. But I’m not going to do anything like that.
Communities living adjacent to the protected areas struggle with human-wildlife conflict. Change of land use from pastoralism to agriculture has resulted in lifestyles incompatible with wildlife conservation. To reduce human-wildlife conflict and animal deaths, in came the Born Free Foundation with predator-proof bomas (PPBs). The organisation has built the structures across five community-managed group ranches. Demand is high and priority is given to individuals in areas with the highest predator conflict. Before 2014, Nchoroke ole Sitonik, a resident of Injakata village in the Olgulului Group Ranch knew no peace. He would sit up all night guarding his cattle and other livestock against wildlife attacks.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — A South Florida woman says she suffered a broken nose when she was attacked by two sisters with a baseball bat during a road rage incident. Mikaela Barboza tells the Miami Herald she cut off another driver on Thursday near Fort Lauderdale. The other driver and her sister, who was in another car, began yelling at her. Barboza says she pulled into a nearby parking lot because she was worried for her safety. She called 911 when the women followed her and blocked in her car. She says she started recording on her cellphone as the women approached.

Iron ore mining was banned in the state of Goa since late 2012 amid allegations of rampant illegal mining and environment damage. MUMBAI: Vedanta Ltd's iron ore division shipped its first cargo of iron ore today after resuming mining operations in August in Goa, the natural resources conglomerate said in a statement. Iron ore mining was banned in the state of Goa since late 2012 amid allegations of rampant illegal mining and environment damage. The ban was eventually lifted but with an upper limit of 20 million tonnes late last year with an aim to preserve the resource for future generations.
CNN wasted no time fretting over the pro-Trump ramifications of Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s report on the FBI’s management of the Clinton email investigation. The other can be found as well, he asserted. Essentially, every decision made by the FBI in the IG report was driven by one of three motivations: (1) Hillary's DEFINITELY going to win; (2) Trump BETTER NOT win; or (3) We must protect the integrity of the FBI! A CNN reporter is excoriating the White House for loading its political arsenal?
Greg Chappell claims the biggest regret of his three-year stint as coach was the fallout with Tendulkar with whom he simply failed to "communicate" properly. MELBOURNE: India's controversial former cricket coach Greg Chappell claims the biggest regret of his tumultuous three-year stint there was the fallout with senior batsman Sachin Tendulkar with whom he simply failed to "communicate" properly. "When I did communicate with them, I was sometimes too abrupt. Once in South Africa, I called in Sachin and Sehwag to ask more of them, I could tell by the look on their faces that they were affronted," he recalled.
The City Council has given a nod to City Manager Michael V. O'Brien's plan to add a new position in his office — assistant city manager for operations. The city administration has been without a clear No. 2 person since January 2011 when former Assistant City Manager Julie Jacobson stepped down to become town manager in Auburn. The position was eventually eliminated. The council last night gave the city manager the green light to restructure the staffing in his office when it gave preliminary approval to the fiscal 2013 budget for the city manager's executive office.
Sometimes salvaged lumber's best qualities can also be its most infuriating. Chris Behm, cofounder of End Grain Woodworking in Detroit, has you covered. 1. One end of your 2 x 4 could be wider than the other. Or the board is warped. Or a portion could be water-damaged. You won't be able to use every inch of a piece of lumber in a project, so purchase a little too much material to work with. 2. It takes one rogue nail to wreak havoc on a saw blade.
ROME — The Venice Film Festival’s independently run Venice Days, modeled on Cannes Directors’ Fortnight, has unveiled its lineup of 12 pics unspooling in the official selection which marks a departure from its customary Eurocrentric bent, and sees the U.S. playing prominently thanks in part to a pact with Tribeca. Venice Days and Tribeca have launched a “cultural exchange” initiative under which Venice Days as a special event will screen a U.S. title chosen by Tribeca – this year Josh and Benny Safdie’s docu “Lenny Cooke” – while Tribeca will be showcasing a European pic selected by Venice Days.

Cook, 19, of Wichita Falls has been charged with burglary of a habitation, a second-degree felony, according to court documents. The man accused of murdering a Wichita Falls teen girl is facing a new allegation that he burgled a home to get the gun authorities believe he used to kill her, according to court documents. Joshua Charles Christopher Ray Cook, 19, of Wichita Falls has been charged with burglary of a habitation, a second-degree felony, according to court documents. Cook has an additional bond of $100,000, bringing his total bonds to $850,000 for the charges of murder and burglary.
Contrary to what you may have read, running unshod isn’t natural. Sure it may have been centuries ago, but the modern foot has no barefoot experience. That’s not to say that all claims made by barefoot advocates are false. But it does mean that you’re right to question whether barefoot running is right for you. Adding to this body of knowledge is a study out of Brigham Young University that tracked the health of feet making the transition from running in shoes to minimalist footwear (Vibram Five Fingers).
Summit County Children Services and several nonprofit groups are putting the spotlight on fathers June 15 with a countywide conference devoted to dads. Call of Duty: Courageous Men! will include seminars, exhibitors and speeches. The keynote speaker will be Kent State University football coach Darrell Hazell.

The event is from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Akron-Summit County Public Library in downtown Akron. It is sponsored by the Father Factor, Fame Fathers, Man2Man and Men of Valor/Williams Challenge Scholarship Fund.
Cleveland, OH – Cleveland Browns quarterback Brian Hoyer left Thursday&apos;s game against the Buffalo Bills with a right knee injury. The former third-string quarterback and native of suburban Cleveland, Hoyer, who filled in for an injured Brandon Weeden and engineered back- to-back victories, exited early in the first quarter with a knee injury. Hoyer was hurt while sliding at the end of a scramble. He broke free along the right sideline and picked up a first down, but was hit from behind by Bills linebacker Kiko Alonso and his legs bent awkwardly underneath him.
TSN Toronto reporter Kristen Shilton checks in daily with news and notes on the Maple Leafs, who held a team meeting before facing the Buffalo Sabres at KeyBank Center Wednesday night. It’s rare that a losing effort can also be a beacon of light, but that’s exactly what Tuesday’s 3-0 loss to the Nashville Predators was for the Toronto Maple Leafs. After four straight games last week where Toronto was outscored 23-15 and went 1-3-0, the Leafs came away from Nashville having allowed their second-fewest shots on goal this season (20) and were buoyed by an overall improved defensive performance.
This is the tentative floor plan for the remodeled East and West Tech Buildings. Plans could change as user groups complete meetings with the architects. The MCCC campus will change once again over the next year. Since the college passed a millage in 2016, it has planned a series of remodeling projects. The East and West Tech Buildings will be combined starting in the Fall Semester, which will create offices, computer labs, classrooms, and a brand new student space. Construction will begin during Fall semester and will continue over the course of the semester until its finished, said Sue Wetzel, vice president of Administration.
The Sioux Falls School District is looking to ensure more students graduate ready to enter college or the workforce, and adding another test could be part of the solution. District officials earlier this month presented school board members with their case to consider adding the National Career Readiness Certificate (NCRC) to the list of assessments for high school students. Officials took a closer look at NCRC in the weeks after learning that, per state accountability scores, most Sioux Falls high school graduates aren’t ready for college or a career. The readiness certificate may help improve that score.
As I mentioned in my review this week, I came to the Prototype continuity late. Now that I'm not hustled for time to pump out a review of a game the day after it releases, I feel like revisiting New York and finishing out the original Prototype, especially as I'll get to stomp around a larger-scale Manhattan before everything goes straight to hell. I've said it before, I'll say it forever. I would have so much time to play video games if my job was not to play video games. So, that's what I'll be getting into this weekend.
No. 11 Tennessee fell to No. 5 Alabama, 10-3, on Saturday at Rhoads Stadium. The Crimson Tide, which won Game 2 on Friday, 3-1, took the series with Saturday&apos;s victory. Tennessee won Game 1 on Thursday, 3-2. The game was halted for nearly one hour in the top of the fifth due to lightning in the area. (14-6) took the loss after striking out three and allowing four runs over 3.2 frames. allowed three runs in one relief inning. agave up three runs in one relief frame.
We don't really know what the Joggler from O2 is: it looks like a photo frame, behaves like an internet portal, and is part of a growing trend of connected internet buddies. The O2 Joggler, based on Open Peak's OpenFrame, sports a 7-inch touchscreen. It is perhaps thicker than most modern photo frames, but with a solid stand on the back it looks and feels like a high quality device. That 7-inch screen is good and bright too, delivering the heavily O2-ised icons that make up the menus.
Emirates has unveiled the first aircraft in its fleet with a new livery dedicated to Expo 2020 Dubai. The design was installed on A6-EPK, an Emirates Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, at the Emirates Engineering hangar. The livery is based on the Expo 2020 logo, inspired by an ancient gold ring excavated in Dubai, and it underlines Emirates’ support for the vision of Expo 2020 Dubai. Emirates is the Official Airline Partner of the event. Emirates will be installing three different decal designs to reflect the different themes of Expo 2020: opportunity, mobility and sustainability.
KABUL: The Chief Executive of the Government of National Unity Abdullah Abdullah met with the Commander of the NATO Joint Force Command Brunssum General Riccardo Marchiò in Kabul. The Office of the Chief Executive in a statement said Mr. Abdullah and Gen. Marchiò met in Sapidar Palace in Kabul on Thursday. The statement further added that Mr. Abdullah welcomed Gen. Marchiò to Kabul as he thanked NATO for its active presence and contribution in Afghanistan to combat terrorism and support the Afghan National Defense and Security Force. In his turn, Gen. Marchiò expressed satisfaction regarding the developments achieved by the Afghan forces and reaffirmed NATO’s long term support to Afghanistan.
What is Obama's End Game on Israel? President Barack Obama has made it impossible for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to accept a negotiated settlement with Israel. President Obama's decision to engineer passage of U.N. Security Council 2334 in the final weeks of his presidency wasn't a bid to revive the Israeli-Palestinian "peace process," a "parting shot" at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, or any of the other characterizations splashed across cable news chyrons over the weekend. Rather, it was intended to irrevocably destroy the viability of the very "two-state solution" the president claims to be protecting.
Plus: If your friend wants to fall for this scam, you can’t stop her. DEAR CAROLYN: A group of 10 ladies gets together weekly, and we do an annual trip together. Nine of us are frustrated by one friend who does not have group social skills. She interrupts constantly, asking questions that would be answered if one could finish one’s story. She responds to every comment, dominating conversations. We find ourselves going totally silent to control the constant chatter, which includes talking to herself. Nine of us are miserable.
“This is the most exciting IPL. I think that there is a value addition after two new teams (Kochi Tuskers and Pune Warriors) have come in. With the 10-team format you can play on the final day and still be within a chance of making the play-offs,” said Ashwin ahead of the defending champions’ clash with Mumbai Indians on Friday. “But I think that with the kind of side and ability, we would try and achieve what we have been doing over the last three years,” said the 24-year-old bowler about his side’s chances in the tournament.
Despite continued woes in the U.S. economy, the greenback has seen an unexpected surge against currencies around the world. As investors become ever more risk averse, emerging markets are bearing the brunt of a flight to safety. But Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Asset Management, sees a reversal around the corner. "As everyone is rushing into US Treasurys, they need U.S. dollars to do that and have therefore sold everything in sight," Mobius told CNBC. "This is why emerging markets have gone down, why commodities have gone down. as everyone is moving into dollars."
MANCHESTER UNITED last night confirmed the emergence of their latest wing wizard – Adnan Januzaj. The Belgian starlet marked his full debut at the age of 18 with two second-half goals as United staged a spirited recovery. Bottom-of-the-table Sunderland led at the break through Craig Gardner’s early goal. But United recovered to prevent a third successive league defeat. And the club with a tradition of having top wingers had their latest exciting discovery – Januzaj – to thank. It was a night when spirited Sunderland made United wait until the 55th minute for an equaliser.
“It is impossible to think of an environmentally-conscious generation without thinking about the children. So I visit primary schools every so often to have environmental awareness talks with the pupils. Some days, we plant flowers around the school and have pupils adopt them. Yes, the government has its role, but putting up litter bins is not enough. Citizens have to understand the role they play in keeping the environment clean. Getting people to fund the project is also a problem because the results are not tangible, yet most people prefer to contribute to causes where the results are physically tangible.
The 15th Missouri Tiger soccer team (15-5-1. 7-3-0) won the Big 12 Tournament Championship on Sunday with a 1-0 win over No. 10 Colorado (14-4-4, 6-2-2) at Blossom Soccer Complex in San Antonio. Senior captain Mo Redmond scored in the sixth minute and the defense held off a Buffalo charge to earn the program’s first ever conference crown. They’ll find their spot in the NCAA field of 64 tonight at 7pm on ESPNews. Junior goalkeeper Tasha Dittamore recorded two saves to extend her single season record in shutouts to nine, and the team recorded their 11th shutout in 21 games this season.
Salvu Sammut's brilliant career was cut short by a fatal traffic accident when he was only 28. The 1931-32 league was not one of the best in the history of the competition. Only four teams took part, two of them from Sliema. The other two were Ħamrun Spartans and Valletta. The interest, however, was still as keen as one would have expected and the competition is best remembered for the fine football displayed, especially by Valletta and Sliema Wanderers. One match stands out from the rest, if only for the great performance produced by Salvu Sammut.

For the first time in a decade, a bipartisan climate bill is on the table in Congress. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act would institute a national carbon tax. If it passes (and that’s a giant if) the money would be returned to American households, meaning that each of us could get a nice check for about $500 each year. The bill was proposed last week by a collection of members of the U.S. House of Representatives from the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. And it’s pretty ambitious for legislation with support from both sides of the aisle.
Back in February, Darren Collison was suffering discomfort linked to a core muscle injury that required surgery, and he missed the rest of the season. Now the point guard feels like a new man and showed it in Monday’s preseason opener, a 109-105 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. Collison had 22 points and 10 assists – and believes he’s ready for a big season. Dallas Keuchel pitches three-hit ball for six innings, Colby Rasmus and Carlos Gomez each homer, and the Houston Astros beat the New York Yankees 3-0 in the American League wild-card game.
Guardian News & Media has promoted Anna Bateson to the newly created role of chief customer officer. The move comes as the publisher said it now has 230,000 paying members and 185,000 digital and print subscribers. Bateson is to “oversee the Guardian brand and all Guardian marketing” alongside assuming responsibility for memberships, subscriptions and contribution programmes. She is also in charge of parnerships with technology businesses such as Google and Facebook. Bateson was made vice president for Platforms and Partnerships for GNM in December 2016. She previously ran consumer marketing for Google and Youtube based in San Francisco.
An ailing Mao Zedong was presiding over the last knockings of the Cultural Revolution when the era of modern summitry was launched in a French chateau just outside Paris in late 1975. It’s a reasonable bet that none of those present at Rambouillet envisaged that 43 years later the annual get-together for their successors would be in Hangzhou. The emergence of China as an economic superpower with its distinctive breed of state capitalism is a striking example of what has changed in the past four decades. Back then, the six developed nations represented at Rambouillet dominated the global economy.
At a time when Sears Holdings Corp. and Macy’s Inc. are shutting down stores, and many malls are struggling to attract high-profile tenants to fill empty spaces, the giant online retailer has been ramping up its presence in physical retail. Amazon plans to open more Whole Foods stores that could include new formats after retreating from a smaller store experiment called 365, according to the chain’s chief executive in comments made at a forum last week. Amazon is also experimenting with different types of brick-and-mortar outlets, from book shops to pop-up stores.
Melissa Green's mother spoke Spanish, but she never learned � her father forbid it. Today, that's a frequent problem in this city where the English-speaking population is outnumbered. MIAMI � Melissa Green's mother spoke Spanish, but she never learned � her father forbid it. Today, that's a frequent problem in this city where the English-speaking population is outnumbered. In stores, shopkeepers wait on their clients in Spanish. Universities offer programs for Spanish speakers. And in supermarkets, banks, restaurants � even at the post office and government offices � information is given and assistance is offered in Spanish.
B&M, Inc. of Mount Vernon, Missouri is voluntarily recalling O Organics Organic Celery Seed sold in Safeway stores due to potential Salmonella contamination. The product is sold at all Safeway-owned stores, including Safeway, Carrs, Dominick’s, Genuardi’s, Pak ‘N Save, Pavilions, Randalls, Tom Thumb and Vons. Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
Star Ledger also adds that the down-to-Earth singer still plays to “monstrous arena shows” and represents the “working class” through his most popular songs. Although eligible for social security soon, it’s difficult to see Springsteen as a senior citizen when he’s one of the greatest living rock stars. Most recently, Star Ledger also covered a story about Springsteen’s unexpected popularity in the political realm through his self-proclaimed Springsteen super fan, New Jersey governor Chris Christie. The politician has repeatedly referenced Bruce Springsteen’s impact on New Jersey heritage.
Bradley Lowery's parents thanked the British public for 'helping them get out of bed' as they deal with their son's death during an emotional night at BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards. The Sunderland fan died in July after a brave fight with neuroblastoma - a rare type of cancer - that captured hearts around the sporting world. During a number of appearances as mascot, Bradley struck up a close friendship with the then Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe and the pair led out England for a World Cup qualifier at Wembley in March.
State Street Corp. shares plunged by nearly 60 percent in one day to their lowest level in more than 12 years after the company disclosed that its unrealized investment losses have grown significantly in the past three months. The Boston financial company has insisted that those investments are improperly valued due to weak market conditions. But analysts and investors are becoming increasingly worried that State Street could be forced to sell those investments and report billions of dollars in losses. The difference between the state's jobless rate and the nation's jobless rate narrowed significantly in December, as the state's economic recession began to catch up with the nation's.
Charles Glascock is no longer effective as mayor of Casselberry. His running turf battles with council members, his cavalier dealings with department heads, his insistence that he pull every string, all negate his positive attributes. If Casselberry city government is to be more than a sniping ground for egos, Mr. Glascock must be replaced in next week's election, and the best choice is Owen Sheppard. The Orlando Sentinel also believes that the best choices for the two council seats on the ballot are the incumbents, Al Harmon and Tom Embree. On paper, Mr. Glascock, 57, makes a good mayor.
There is a truly exhaustive study on breakfast cereals in the latest issue of Consumer Reports. How much sugar does each brand of cereal contain? How much salt? What is the "nutritional quality" of cold cereal as compared to hot cereal? Does vitamin "fortification" help? Fifty-seven boxes of cereal decorate the magazine cover in the form of a labyrinth, symbolizing our national search for the Perfect Food, as if in brans and fibers we hoped to find eternal life -- or at least a flat stomach while it lasts.
Nathan Wiseman's flaw was that he was too "naive and trusting". "His mother tried to tell him not to trust everyone," his grandmother Anthea Anthony said. "But he couldn't see bad in anyone." The man who breached that trust, by stabbing Mr Wiseman to death in a jealous rage, has received a life sentence for his murder. Robert John Nott, 42, twice reassured the 21-year-old's worried mother Pauline Thorn he was safe with him, saying "he'll be right with us, love".
Can President Clinton Pardon Himself? President Clinton promised this month not to pardon himself. It’s surprising to see Clinton voluntarily relinquish a legal weapon, but even more surprising that he had his hands on it in the first place. Can the president really pardon himself? No one knows the answer. The Constitution says that the president “shall have the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.” This sentence, like many in the Constitution, can reasonably be interpreted in several ways.
HONG KONG (CNNMoney) — In an industry renowned for its brutal business cycles, nothing could have prepared Malaysia Airlines for last year. Two tragedies — one of which continues to play out as the world’s greatest aviation mystery — and the resulting avalanche of negative publicity has left the airline battered and bruised. But not broken. Those who predicted the imminent demise of Malaysian Airlines in the wake of the disappearance of MH370 last March, and the shooting down of MH17 a little more than three months later, have been proved wrong.
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama on Saturday called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to de-escalate tensions in Ukraine by pulling his forces back to bases in the country's Crimean region and to refrain from any interference elsewhere in Ukraine. The White House says Obama delivered that message to Putin during a 90-minute telephone conversation. But Obama's request was unlikely to be granted. The Kremlin said Putin emphasized to Obama that real threats exist to the life and health of Russian citizens living in Ukraine and that Russia has the right to protect its interests there.
Two Toronto Community Housing Corporation (TCHC) execs have been put on administrative leave and a consultant canned amid recent revelations by the Toronto Sun of apparent irregularities with how a $1.3-million contract was awarded. A statement issued by TCHC late Monday afternoon indicates that CEO Kathy Milsom and the employee who oversaw the RFP process have been placed on administrative leave while an “independent, third-party review” is conducted into how a contract with Edmond Millena of Orchango was procured earlier this year. According to the statement, the board has also directed TCHC officials to terminate Mellina, a “change management” consultant immediately.
HELSINKI (Reuters) - The design team that conceived Nokia’s new handset in 2002 called it simply “Penny”, a modest nickname for what would five years and 200 million units later become the world’s top-selling consumer electronics product. The Nokia 1100 hit the market in late 2003, just in time to catch a major growth wave in emerging markets like China. With a torch light, no-slip grips, and a dust-proof case, the little phone was made for the new growth regions. Nokia said on Thursday that the entry-level 1100 and its heirs had surpassed the 200 million-unit milestone.
SHREWSBURY - Mildred F. "Millie" (Leland) Carter, 92, of Shrewsbury, passed away on Tuesday, November 26, 2013, at the Autumn Village Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. Her husband, Anthony A. "Tony" Carter, predeceased her in February 2000. Millie is survived by two sons, Anthony F. Carter and his wife Joan of Shrewsbury and Joseph Grudinsky and his wife Sandra of Auburn; a daughter, Nancy Wadowski of Shrewsbury; a daughter in law, Marcelle Carter of Shrewsbury; thirteen grandchildren; nineteen great grandchildren; many nieces and nephews.
Published: Nov. 26, 2012 at 08:54 a.m. Updated: Nov. 26, 2012 at 08:39 p.m. It must have been hard for the Green Bay Packers to not look back after Sunday night's beatdown at the hands of the New York Giants. The team was whipped up front, on a big stage, by the same team that ended their title hopes last season. "There's no rhyme or reason about it," right guard Josh Sitton told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel after the game. "They beat us up, man. They kicked our (expletive) today.
Prosecutors have offered to buy Scott Peterson's truck to use in his murder trial. CNN's Kimberly Osias reports on the date set in the Scott Peterson murder trial. MODESTO, California (CNN) -- Prosecutors in the murder case against Scott Peterson said Friday they want to buy his truck, which they contend he used to ferry the bodies of his wife and unborn son to San Francisco Bay, where they washed ashore in April. Over objections from prosecutors, Stanislaus County Superior Court Judge Al Girolami has ordered that Peterson's truck, which police seized 11 months ago, be returned to him.
A new book exposes false assumptions behind GOP and Democratic strategies. In April, a child born somewhere in California made Hispanics the state's largest racial-ethnic group, replacing whites. Texas will be majority-Hispanic by 2020. In Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, and South Dakota, Hispanic populations have doubled since 2000. "If the past is the prologue, the more than 53 million souls who make up this (mostly) new American community may well rewrite the political history of the United States," social scientists Matt Barreto and Gary Segura write in their new book, Latino America.
BREAKING: Makeready has won an auction to finance Queen & Slim, with Oscar-nominated Get Out star Daniel Kaluuya starring and Melina Matsoukas making her feature directing debut.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. - The Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles touts several improved strategies in their January status report for its approved corrective action plan. Governor Kay Ivey and Attorney General Steve Marshall mandated the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles provide monthly reports following a demand for change within the board by the governor and AG. Then, a review committee made up of no fewer than five people, including senior probation and parole officers, will decide whether to recommend early parole to a deputy or assistant attorney general who will approve or deny the request.

Brexit will not stop the economies of Northern Ireland and the Republic growing, an economist has said. Andrew Webb, who has been appointed as the new chief economist for Grant Thornton in Northern Ireland, was speaking as the UK was granted an extension to Article 50 late on Wednesday night. The UK is now on course to leave the EU on a new date, October 31, or sooner if MPs approve a withdrawal deal. It could still leave without a deal on June 1 if MPs reject taking part in European elections.
Young people are heavily involved in the uprising now under way in Libya: They are members of the rebel military; they are working to help form a new government; they are also producing revolutionary artwork, publications and music. On any given day, you can find at least a few of Benghazi's young and restless in a large, empty cement lot off one of the city's main thoroughfares. Cartoons and sketches of Moammar Gadhafi are popping up across Benghazi. Many are the work of cartoonists working at the Media Center for the 17th of February Revolution.
Streaming services like Spotify and Amazon Instant Video offer the option for offline playback -- the key benefit of which is the ability to listen to or watch content in situations where Wi-Fi is not available -- and it may only be a matter of time before Netflix offers the same. Its CEO Reed Hastings, when questioned on the prospect in an earnings call this week, clearly indicated it's not something he's opposed to. "We should keep an open mind on all this... as we expand around the world where we see an uneven set of networks, it's something we should keep an open mind about."
THE CALVARY, one of the dominant features of the central-Slovak city of Banská Štiavnica, can now be seen at night. Starting from November 27, 2012, its Horný Kostol / Upper Church has been basking in the glow of floodlights each night, joining Banská Štiavnica’s Old and New Castles, which were already illuminated. The project is the result of efforts by members of the Calvary Fund civic association and general sponsor Stredoslovenská Energetika, an energy distribution company. The civic association has been working to restore the calvary since 2008, and the electrification project was started two years ago and is expected to last for five years.
The NFL announced Friday that it will not suspend Washington Redskins linebacker Reuben Foster after he was twice arrested twice for domestic violence last year. The league found that Foster did not violate its personal conduct policy, but he will be fined two game checks for violating conditions that the league required of him after he was suspended for the first two games of last season. Friday’s announcement means Foster, 25, will be eligible to play next season and can take part in the team’s offseason conditioning program, which starts Monday.
Etihad Airways and Royal Jordanian Airline have announced a new codeshare partnership to provide customers with greater access to key leisure and business destinations in North Africa, Europe, Canada, Asia and Australia. This is the first such partnership between the two airlines which offer multiple daily services between their respective hubs in Abu Dhabi and Amman. The partnership will see Etihad Airways place its ‘EY’ code on Royal Jordanian’s flights from Abu Dhabi via Amman’s Queen Alia International Airport to Larnaca and Berlin, while Algiers, Tunis, Vienna and Montreal will be added to the agreement soon.
Pundits can argue about devaluation versus market forces. But only one man knows for sure what the People’s Bank of China was up to when the value of the renminbi fell last week. What’s going on at China’s central bank? The People’s Bank of China, led by Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, has been slowly liberalizing currency and capital markets for several years now. Last week, though, it made a monetary policy move that surprised people around the world. A week later, those same people can’t seem to agree on what it means.

BANGKOK — Thailand’s military government on Tuesday lifted a ban on political activities it imposed when it seized power in a coup more than four years ago, an action taken in preparation for elections promised for early next year. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha invoked a special executive power with publication in the Royal Gazette of the order easing several restrictions that were set after the army seized power from an elected government in May 2014. The order included the lifting of a ban on political gatherings of more than five people that the ruling junta has used as one of many measures to suppress opponents of its rule.
Etsy proved that homespun and hand-crafted items could turn into a big business. Now, it's planning on sharing some of its IPO with the crafty people who made it a success. With the IPO slated to price on Wednesday and start trading on Thursday, the initial stock sale will introduce many of Etsy's vendors into the rarified world of participating in initial stock sales. About 5 percent of the shares were set aside to sell to vendors and small investors, or the types of people who generally lack access to IPOs, according to The Wall Street Journal.
This is a great time of the year to be the head of Canada’s business development bank. That’s because every autumn, BDC organizes Small Business Week and that gives me a chance to do one of my favourite things: meet with entrepreneurs and talk about how they overcome the challenges they face. In my more than 30 years as a chief executive, mostly in the private sector, I can honestly say that running a business is more difficult today than it has ever been. Entrepreneurs are confronted by an unforgiving landscape of rapid technological change, fierce, often global, competition and persistent economic turbulence.
Tatiana Mirutenko loved volleyball, art and food, those who knew her say, and she pursued it all with a passion. The 27-year-old, who was born in McHenry and grew up in Hawthorn Woods, was killed Saturday in Mexico City in an apparent drive-by shooting in Lomas de Chapultepec, a wealthy neighborhood in the Mexican capital. Her father, Wasyl Mirutenko, said Tatiana was visiting Mexico City on an anniversary trip with her husband of one year, James Hoover. Mexico was a common vacation destination for the Mirutenko family and a place Tatiana loved, her father said.
An indigenous education advocate in Winnipeg says the federal government's 2015 budget is not providing enough funding to help aboriginal students. The Conservative government's budget, which was tabled on Tuesday, earmarks $200 million over five years starting in 2015-16 "to help support First Nations to achieve better education outcomes, including building partnerships with provincial school systems." But that amount falls short of the $1.9 billion that Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced in February 2014, says Rebecca Chartrand, an aboriginal education consultant with the Seven Oaks School Division.
Are You Missing Out By Shopping A Retailer's Mobile Site Instead Of Desktop? Last year’s holiday season was a hands-down winner for mobile shopping. Traffic and sales both hit all-time highs during Holiday 2017. In my own company’s examination of retailers’ eCommerce strategies (to be released August 25th), we found that 90% of surveyed retailers reported that more traffic now comes from mobile than from desktop. For consumers, it’s easy to think that because it’s “digital” they are getting the same experience on mobile that they’re getting from the desktop site.
When human error costs billions. Today is the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl meltdown, one of the most expensive human errors in history. But mistakes come in many forms. We tracked down the inflation-adjusted damages of some of the worst mistakes ever, including terrible mergers, oil spills and illicit sexual affairs. At the end of in 2009, America was shook by reports that Tiger Woods had engaged in multiple illicit sexual affairs. Within a year, Tiger agreed to a $750 million divorce settlement with Elin Nordegren. Total cost of this mistake was even higher if you include stock loss for Nike, Gatorade and other sponsors.

The Literacy Coalition of Palm Beach County and its nonprofit partners are asking residents to join in a county-wide celebration of Pink Shirt Day.

Nine South Sudanese opposition groups have formed an alliance to accelerate efforts to end the conflict in South Sudan. Kwaje Lasu, secretary-general of the South Sudan National Movement for Change, told VOA's South Sudan In Focus program Thursday that the various opposition groups had united. "We in opposition believe that the unity of the opposition is paramount to address the issues that brought the country to the crisis, and since High [Level] Revitalization Forum 2, we have been working together collectively as a unified opposition addressing the issues of the country.''

All of this is just so embarrassing for the Knicks, who for whatever reason just can’t seem to have a boring, dignified losing season like so many other teams. Oh no, this has to turn into open discord between their best player and the man running the shots, as a series of leaks have revealed that the Knicks have tried to move Carmelo Anthony to the Cavaliers in exchange for Kevin Love—and were rebuffed. You can say a lot of things about the Knicks, but not that they’re ever off-brand.
Three leading presidential candidates from the governing National Liberation Party (PLN) are stepping up their campaigns in what promises to be a vigorous internal fight for the nomination. Former Vice President Laura Chinchilla, San José Mayor Johnny Araya and former Public Security Minister Fernando Berrocal are canvassing the country to persuade party leaders to support them in a nationwide open primary in June. Berrocal formally announced his candidacy for the 2010 elections Saturday in the southern town of La Lucha, where he laid flowers at the grave of party founder and three-time president José “Pepe” Figueres.

The absolute final vote on the incredibly controversial Copyright Reform was held today, with 19 EU member states voting in favor of making it EU law. Despite the Netherlands, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Finland, and Sweden voting against the Copyright Reform — and Estonia, Belgium, and Slovenia abstaining — it’ll now be mandatory for all EU countries to implement the law at a national level. This will include the most controversial parts of the directive: Article 11 (aka link tax) and Article 13 (aka upload filters).
LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Shares in Europe surged on Monday behind double-digit-percentage gains for financials, after European finance ministers and central bankers agreed to a 750-billion-euro loan package designed to stop a crisis that started in Greece from spreading through the rest of the region. After tumbling 8.7% last week on fears of bond-market contagion, the Stoxx Europe 600 index (SXXP) jumped 6.9% to 253.52. That's the index's best one-day percentage gain since a 7.2% jump on Oct. 29, 2008. It was the benchmark index's fifth best one-day percentage gain in its history.
By 1984, while still in his 20s, David Axelrod had already built an impressive career as a star political reporter, columnist and City Hall bureau chief for the Tribune, the largest and most influential newspaper in Illinois. It was his dream job. But he was unhappy. Always awash with doubts and anxieties, Axelrod would agonize over the nuances of the stories he was writing, putting in long hours in the city's wards doing research and then spending hours more at the computer keyboard. But that was who he was. Much more troublesome to him was how his career had begun to plateau.

When cable eventually dies, websites like Hulu will be held responsible. Unlike YouTube and other amateur-video-upload sites, Hulu is a hub for network TV shows and movies: Hulu offers shows from nbc, Fox, pbs and other channels, including free full episodes of SNL, The Daily Show, The Office and other hits the TiVo-less masses often miss, plus films like Ghostbusters, The Fifth Element and Lost in Translation. Created as a network-approved alternative to YouTube's grab bag, Hulu was at first roundly mocked as a ham-fisted corporate knockoff of the grass-roots glory that is YouTube.

Hillary Clinton showed both vulnerability and defiance in a wide-ranging town hall meeting on Wednesday night, openly discussing her personal search for humility and firmly saying her expensive paid speeches to Wall Street firms were not a mistake. The town hall, which was led mostly by audience questions, included pointed questions about Clinton’s vote for the Iraq War and her stance on Wall Street, but also allowed for revealing mediation on personal questions, both by her and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who preceded her on stage.
A man was shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop in eastern New Orleans early Monday morning, according to the New Orleans Police Department. No officers were injured in the shooting. Around 4:20 a.m., Seventh District Officer Frederick Carter, a 14-year veteran, stopped a white Mazda MPV for a traffic violation at the intersection of Chef Menteur Highway and Old Gentilly Road, Frank Robertson, public information officer for the NOPD, said in a statement. "As the officer was approaching the MPV a shot was fired," Robertson said.
Progress is a funny thing—it doesn’t always occur the way you expected it to. Though LGBTQ stories have been floating around Hollywood for years, many would say that particular glass ceiling was broken with 2016’s Best Picture–winning Moonlight and last year’s critically praised Call Me by Your Name. Now, awards predictor Gold Derby notes that as many as eight actors could be nominated for Oscars for LGBTQ roles, though all of them are straight. We’ve rung the bell for Olivia Colman’s work in The Favourite, but her co-stars Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz will also likely garner nominations.
The rally, which was announced last month as scheduled to take place on January 11, was cancelled 'because of the current situation in Paris,' Holland4Israel group wrote. Citing security concerns, organizers of a pro-Israel rally in Amsterdam cancelled the event after meeting with police and city officials. The rally, which was announced last month as scheduled to take place on January 11, was cancelled “because of the current situation in Paris and in coordination with the police, the municipality and security,” members of the Holland4Israel group wrote Friday on their Facebook page.
Egypt's presidency announces that vote on the controversial constitutional referendum is to take place over two days. Egypt's presidency has announced that the referendum on the a draft constitution will be held over two days. The announcement, made on Wednesday, stated that the vote will be held on December 15 and 22.

(CN) — Women who enter menopause earlier and later in life face an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, according to a study of nearly 125,000 women. Data for the study came from women enrolled in the National Institutes of Health’s Women’s Health Initiative, which aims to prevent postmenopausal women from developing type 2 diabetes. The findings show that women who begin menopause after age 55 have a 12 percent increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, while women who have their final periods before age 45 face a 25 percent increased risk of contracting the disease.
Bombardier has ceded control of its new CSeries to Airbus, abandoning hope of ascending into the top echelons of passenger aircraft manufacturing alongside rivals Airbus and Boeing but securing US market access for its new jetliners. "I am saddened but at the same time reassured," by Bombardier's partnership with Airbus on the CSeries, aeronautics professor Mehran Ebrahimi at the University of Quebec in Montreal told AFP. "Everyone wins in this agreement." The European aircraft manufacturer took a 50.1 percent stake in the CSeries program in exchange for using its sales and marketing heft to lift CSeries sales.
Riding what has been a tumultuous wave for publicly-traded technology stocks, today the cloud-based help desk business Zendesk debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. Setting its pricing at $9 per share yesterday, the stock opened up 27% higher at $11.40 on its first trade — a modest rise and by no means a bust. Things got even more positive as the day went on: it rose steadily throughout Thursday, and at market close market close it was at nearly 49% above its opening price, at $13.65 per share.
Saturday night, in a team meeting at the Casanova Center, new Oregon football coach Mark Helfrich was introduced to his players. The reaction? A standing ovation that was more raucous than courteous. Four days after Chip Kelly left the Ducks for the NFL�s Philadelphia Eagles, Oregon signed Helfrich to a five-year, $9 million contract to take the helm of a program that played in its fourth straight BCS bowl game not even three weeks ago. And by all accounts, the Oregon players unanimously embraced the promotion of Helfrich, the Ducks� offensive coordinator the past four seasons.

A video game user plays XBOX. Picture the average video gamer today. Who do you see? Is it a put-together professional with a family and outside interests who games for fun? Or is it a middle-aged man glued to a computer screen sucking Cheeto dust from his fingers in a dark corner of a basement? In the past, the latter has been the stereotypical image of the average gamer – introverted, quiet, eschewing outside contact with real people in lieu of virtual stories and characters. But in today’s online world, gaming has taken on a much more social identity.
A BUSINESS case for the Norman St Bridge has been finished and several other projects are being progressed by Ipswich City Council's infrastructure department. According to the department's latest report, authored by its chief operating officer Charlie Dill, almost 10 major projects are in progress, many are close to finalisation.

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew praised striker Demba Ba for turning his anger into goals to kick-start the club's Barclays Premier League campaign. Ba's double at Everton on Monday night - after he was initially left smouldering on the bench - secured an unlikely point, and his strike at St James' Park on Sunday saw off Norwich 1-0. The forward made his feelings clear after his heroics at Goodison Park, and agent Alex Gontran suggested the player would have to consider his options if he was dropped again. Pardew said: "There has just been so much nonsense written about it.
Organiser Didier Jiminez-Castro said he hoped the balloon would spur enthusiasm for Democratic candidates in November's congressional elections. The crash occurred about 10:20 am in Mount Olive Township in northern New Jersey's Morris County, Governor Phil Murphy told a news conference. Volkswagen AG confirmed Tuesday it has agreed to pay $69 million to settle New Jersey state diesel emissions claims, one of the last major outstanding diesel legal issues the German automaker faces in the United States. US President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday wrapped up a busy weekend of meetings with cabinet hopefuls at his golf club retreat outside New York, hinting new appointments should come soon.
The Fourth of July means cookouts, fireworks and patriotism galore. Editor's note: This story was originally published June 30, 2016. The Fourth of July means cookouts, fireworks, patriotism galore — and this year, it also means a three-day weekend. But between that lunchtime burger and the last light of the sky, take a moment to learn some new or forgotten things about America’s birthday. For a crash course in interesting facts about the most American holiday, we went to Kelly Smith, curator of collections for the Upcountry History Museum – Furman University and an adjunct professor of American history at USC Upstate.
Once again our friends at the Institute for Energy Research have issued the best smack down of Obama’s amazing energy claims. Read the link for the whole text, which isn’t long, but their three charts reprinted below tell the story: oil and gas production are indeed increasing, but on private land, and falling on federal land. Obama has nothing to do with the increase in oil and gas exploration. And as the third chart, which John posted here once before, shows, leasing activity in federal land has slowed to a crawl.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has said he wants to build as many as 3.5 million new houses by 2025 to solve California’s housing crisis. But those ambitious goals could be derailed without hundreds of thousands of new construction workers needed to dramatically accelerate the pace of California home building, even assuming that cities agree to zone for more housing and there’s money available to build it all. And it’s hard to imagine, given recent trends, where that many additional workers in the low-wage, high-risk industry would come from.
A new study shows urban children with poorly controlled asthma, particularly those who are ethnic minorities, suffer academically. Kids who are kept home due to asthma symptoms often aren’t able to do as well in the classroom. Sending kids with allergies and asthma off to summer camp takes an extra dose of planning. The focus for asthma treatment is often stepping up treatment, but clinicians need to know how to step down therapy when symptoms improve. The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology strongly urges the Weatherford Independent School District to reconsider their decision to use Benadryl in place of epinephrine for allergic reactions.
Arvind Kejriwal led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which recently saw 20 of its MLAs being disqualified in the Office of Profit case, has a new challenge ahead of it. Challenging the AAP to face the electorate after 20 of its MLAs were disqualified recently, former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit has asserted that the Congress would make gains if bypolls took place. Arvind Kejriwal led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which recently saw 20 of its MLAs being disqualified in the Office of Profit case, has a new challenge ahead of it.
Islamabad (AP) — Hundreds of fans stayed up late to welcome home members of new Champions Trophy winner Pakistan in the cities of Lahore and Karachi on Tuesday. Messages such as “Champion of champions. Team Pakistan! Welcome back after such a tremendous victory” were emblazoned on banners erected at Allama Iqbal International Airport, along with a picture of the team carrying the trophy. Television footage showed supporters chanting “Pakistan Zindabad,” which means long live Pakistan, when four of the players entered the public area at 2:30 am.
(Newser) – Who doesn't like a farmers market? Organic food, weird jams, and a sense of community have drawn shoppers nationwide for years. But a new study says the markets don't really fulfill their reputation of promoting a healthy diet—and definitely don't save people money, Pacific Standard reports. "There seems to be much enthusiasm for using farmers markets" to improve food quality in areas where healthy food is lacking, a team of researchers writes in the journal Appetite. "It is hard for us to share this enthusiasm."
Laura Kessel has been named editor of The Alliance Review newspaper and its weekly publications in northeast Ohio. The newspaper announced Monday that Kessel will take over for Review managing editor Rob Todor, who will become sports editor of The Review and The Record-Courier in Kent. The 51-year-old Kessel had been working the last four years at The Canton Repository, another GateHouse Media Ohio publication, as managing editor.

LAHORE: Sri Lanka’s cricket team has arrived in Lahore under heavy security on Sunday to play the final T20I of a three-match series, eight years after they were attacked by gunmen there. The team and their officials were taken to a five-star hotel in a bomb-proof bus with hundreds of security guards on the roads and at the resort. International cricket was suspended in the country after the 2009 gun attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore, which left eight people killed and seven visiting players and their staff members injured.
A 3-year-old toddler in the U.K. has been treated in a hospital for alcoholism, The Sun reported. Doctors diagnosed the West Midlands toddler as Britain&apos;s youngest alcoholism patient. The unnamed toddler is thought to have been given booze repeatedly for six months and suffered withdrawal symptoms such as shaking and wild mood swings. The child was among 13 children under the age of 12 diagnosed with alcoholism by the Heart of England NHS Trust between 2008 and 2010. Nicolay Sorensen, of Alcohol Concern, said, "To be diagnosed alcoholic, it&apos;s possible this child would have shown a physical dependency.
Some rebel groups abuse noncombatant populations, while others exhibit restraint. Insurgent leaders in some countries transform local structures of government, while others simply extract resources for their own benefit. In some contexts, groups kill their victims selectively, while in other environments violence appears indiscriminate, even random. This book presents a theory that accounts for the different strategies pursued by rebel groups in civil war, explaining why patterns of insurgent violence vary so much across conflicts. It does so by examining the membership, structure, and behavior of four insurgent movements in Uganda, Mozambique, and Peru.
Life changed for Jonas Hoglund and his family when his 5-year-old son Max was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. Suddenly, they not only had to administer insulin to Max, they had to keep a close watch on his daily life. “You need to know all the variables around you,” Hoglund says. “What he’s doing, what he’s eating, how he’s sleeping and so on.” But the means did not exist to track and evaluate such data. So Hoglund, service design director at design firm Fjord Stockholm, set about creating it.
Thirsty for some wonderful packaging? Man, beer has gotten really arty in the last year or so. Case in point, Oh Beautiful Beer, a whole blog dedicated to "remarkable graphic design from the world of beer." Muskoka's Double Chocolate Cranberry Stout is the obvious winner—because come on, beards. Sadly, most of the other labels here are too orthodox. The fact that Harrumph! Brewing's label isn't an ink drawing of an offended plutocrat strikes me as a wasted opportunity. Looking at this stuff reminds me that it's too bad Edward Gorey never designed a beer label like Ralph Steadman did.
I went to file my taxes recently through a certified accountant. As he clicked my information into his computer, scattered across his desk were my many 1099-MISC forms — the tax document needed to report “miscellaneous” income from gigs, contract work, freelance jobs and the like. I laughed. Sometimes a technical person makes a point of clarification that is so innocent in its cruelty you can only laugh. Many dread filing our taxes not just because it’s a byzantine chore; it feels like an indictment during shifting, ill-defined times.

Authorities are in investigating an accidental shooting at a gun range in Mono County early Friday morning. Mono County Deputies say a 53-year-old man and his 15-year-old were shooting targets with a .22 caliber rifle and 9mm handgun, just after 9 a.m.
Deputies say for undetermined reasons, the son then shot himself with the 9mm handgun. He was transported to Mammoth Hospital and then flown to a Reno hospital due to the extent of his injuries. There’s no immediate update on his condition. Deputies say a preliminary investigation determined that the guns were legally possessed, and registered to the father.
Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS) recently put the final wrap on 2018, reporting a forgettable holiday shopping season. Since Toys R Us went bankrupt over the summer, the toy maker&apos;s sales have struggled to move higher in spite of a healthy U.S. consumer spending lots of money (retail sales were up over 5% from 2017 according to the U.S. Census Bureau). Difficulties remain -- as indicated by the negative 9% stock performance over the last 12 months -- but a solid pipeline for the new year could mean a rebound is in store.
Moscow threatened to deactivate all U.S. Global Positioning Systems on Russian soil Tuesday as part of an escalating dispute over a satellite infrastructure agreement, as well as threatening to withdraw from agreements on the International Space Station. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin lashed out at U.S. negotiators during a Tuesday press conference, calling the U.S. an “unreliable partner” and vowing to retaliate if the U.S. does not allow Russia to install its own GPS systems, known as GLONASS, on U.S. soil, the Moscow Times reports. The U.S. currently operates 11 GPS stations in Russia, which are used to guide rocket and satellite launches.
TRAVERSE CITY - Traverse City Central reaped the spoils from their Division II state hockey championship, as the Trojans filled four of the six spots on the All Big North Conference team. Goaltender Tyler Stricker, forwards Eric O'Hearn and Alex Redmond and defenseman Alex Read all notched First-Team selections for the dominating Trojans. They joined rock-solid Gaylord junior defenseman Will Weber and Traverse City West forward Sean Burke on the squad. Weber is a talented and physical presence on Gaylord's blue line. He has exceptional skating skills for his size and employs a rocket shot.
Anurag Kashyap's Bombay Velvet starriing Anushka and Ranbir Kapoor is set to release on June 6 with two of Sonakshi’s films — the Akshay Kumar-starrer Holiday and Action Jackson with Ajay Devgn. A few days ago, HT Café had reported that two of Katrina Kaif’s films — Bang Bang with Hrithik Roshan, and the Saif Ali Khan-starrer Phantom — are slated to open on the same day, October 2. Now, it turns out, Anushka Sharma and Sonakshi Sinha’s respective films too will suffer a similar fate. As the release of Aamir Khan’s P.K.
Benjamin Franklin reminded his colleagues at the Constitutional Convention to begin by bowing their heads in prayer. The Convention made a deliberate decision not to begin its proceedings with official public prayers. Since meetings of the Continental Congress had done so, and as the First Congress would create a chaplaincy and implement opening prayers in meetings of Congress, the Convention’s decision is noteworthy. In other words, somewhere along the line the decision was made not to open the Constitutional Convention with prayer, even though opening with prayer was typical for similar bodies at the time.
Brandi Glanville, Lisa Vanderpump, and Kyle Richards definitely know how to do drama on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, but when Kyle Richards was told that Mauricio Umansky has been cheating on her the drama levels reached an unbearable level. After Brandi and Lisa confronted Kyle, she had a meltdown of apocalyptic proportions! All of this went down during an episode filming for season 4. Needless to say, things got heated. But just how heated? The scandalosity of the situation escalated too such an epic and out-of-hand proportion that Kyle threatened to leave the show.
Satto Tonegawa, an MIT freshman, was found dead in his dorm room at MacGregor House late last month. CAMBRIDGE - Satto Tonegawa was a bright teenager with a flair for piano and cello. Two months ago he started his freshman year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where his father is a Nobel-winning neuroscientist. He had chosen to live in a single room in an unremarkable 18-story brick dormitory off Memorial Drive. That was where he died, asphyxiating himself with a bag full of helium. His body was found Oct. 25, five days shy of his 19th birthday.
Two science fiction movies go head-to-head, one starring Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling, the other Gerard Butler and Andy Garcia. If you had to bet money on which would outgross the other, you'd surely put your money on Ford and Gosling, confident you'd win that bet. And that's just what happened with Blade Runner 2049 and Geostorm in North America. The Ford-Gosling starring sequel to the 1982 Ridley Scott classic earned $12.6 million on its opening day, three times as much as the $4.3 million earned in its debut by the Butler-starring Geostorm.
Arizona could face up to $650,000 in fines for failing to improve health care for prison inmates. Lawyers for the state filed court papers Feb. 5 listing more than 650 instances during December in which it was unable to comply with terms of a lawsuit settled more than three years ago. A judge warned the state last October it could be fined $1,000 for each instance in which it failed to make improvements promised when it settled the class-action lawsuit over shoddy inmate care. The lawsuit alleged Arizona's 10 state-run prisons didn't meet basic requirements for adequate medical and mental health care.

All babies look kind of similar when they sleep. If you look at the picture, you will notice that overwhelming all the mud and dirt, a peaceful sleep glows all over the face of the baby. The baby was probably sleeping while the whole family were buried alive during the landslide. Now the baby has slipped into another sleep never to wake up from. This little child was supposed to live a full life. Very unfortunately the life has been shortened. And it happened all because… because what? Is it because the bay was born in a poor family?
But the council ultimately voted that down, with many council members saying the moratorium needed to be vetted by a council committee. The moratorium would give Spin, the company which currently has a contract to rent dockless bicycles in Lexington, the right to exclusively operate electric scooters after April 2019. The city would have time before April to set up parameters and restrictions on how they can be used. “There is a company called Bird that has brought these into 45 cities in the last 30 days,” said Scott Thompson, the bicycle and pedestrian planner for the area Metropolitan Planning Organization.
Croydon Mayor, Jonathan Driver's body has been found in his home after he died suddenly on New Year's Eve. Worried relatives of the Mayor, who had been complaining of feeling unwell, called police who broke down the door of his home in Bramley Hill and found him dead. Members of Croydon Council received an email late last night letting them know that the 40-year-old history teacher passed away.

Sandra Bullock slayed the streets of New York City on Friday morning in a very chic, colorful ensemble. The Ocean's 8 star, 54, rocked a blush pink pantsuit by Theory paired with a matching red blouse and heels while out in Midtown Manhattan.

The head of the Earthquake Commission says its service has delivered a huge amount to post-earthquake Christchurch but, given its workload, there will inevitably be people who are unhappy.
