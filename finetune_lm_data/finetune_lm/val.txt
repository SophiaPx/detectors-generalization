"Some may wonder if Barrett, The Honors College is worthy of its name." Graphic published on Thursday, April 26, 2018. Barrett costs $750 extra dollars per year for students, and for Tempe students, the special dining hall meal plan costs $625 more than in other residence halls. Joey Green, a biomedical engineering freshman, dropped Barrett during his first semester at ASU because he said he doesn't think he needs it for his career path. "I have a lot on my plate to finish in the four years that I'm here," he said.
July 23, 2014 (JUBA) – Presidential guards protecting South Sudanese president Salva Kiir have been accused of having gone on a rampage, robbing and terrorising citizens as well as foreigners in the national capital, Juba, a senior security official has claimed. Residents in Juba told Sudan Tribune that soldiers from the Tiger unit of the presidential guards always roam the city with their official pickup trucks, terrorising and looting citizens at night with impunity. They said the bodyguards allegedly move as night patrol units in disguise and target different suburbs in the city where they victimise residents.
Google has hit back at a report from the Associated Press which says that three of its self-driving cars have been involved in accidents since they hit Californian roads in September last year. According to the report, Google’s self-driving Lexuses accounted for three of the four accidents involving self-driving cars (the fourth involved a 2014 Audi SQ5 belonging to automotive technology company Delphi). The report took particular issue with the fact the California Department of Motor Vehicles said it could not release details from accident reports and claimed that the lack of transparency meant that people weren’t getting a true sense of the risks associated with the technology.
Deputies say Knudsen, who appeared to be "highly intoxicated," told them he had gotten into an argument with his son because he told the child not to "eat all the Cheez-Its or drink all the tea," but that the command was disregarded. This made the father "upset." In a rage, Knudsen allegedly struck the juvenile in the face with a closed fist; the child then admitted to pushing the adult against the wall, which caused a laceration to the man's head. The suspect was unable to explain his injuries as he was so drunk, read the report.
BROOKLYN (CN) – Jurors in the month-long trial of “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli heard closing statements from both sides Thursday in a Brooklyn federal courthouse, a day before they begin deliberating whether to send him to prison for up to 20 years on securities-fraud charges. “Everyone ultimately got repaid,” emphasized Shkreli’s showman of a defense attorney Benjamin Brafman. “This is rich people BS!” Brafman declared several times, shrugging off both the charges against Shkreli and the investor witnesses who have recently sought to distance themselves from the publicly scorned defendant.
Washington Supreme Court outlaws death penalty in the state for good. The death chamber at the Georgia Diagnostic Prison in Jackson, GA.
On Thursday, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that capital punishment violates the state constitution. The court held that, as applied in Washington State, the death penalty has been imposed in an unlawfully “arbitrary and racially biased manner.” It thus converted all death sentences to life imprisonment and barred the future imposition of capital sentences. The court’s ruling was unanimous and cannot be reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
'Wait and see', replies the Director of Public Prosecutions as opponents of assisted suicide say that victory for Debbie Purdy would put vulnerable people under pressure to request early death. Debbie Purdy, the multiple sclerosis sufferer seeking to clarify the law on assisted suicide, is following in the footsteps of Diane Pretty, who died of motor neurone disease in 2002. Mrs Pretty, you may remember, failed in her attempt to establish that her husband would not be prosecuted if he helped her to commit suicide. Her case was dismissed by the English courts and by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
Agailjhara upazila unit Awami League had set 10:00am yesterday as the deadline for stamping 70 percent ballots in favour of the party-backed chairman candidate in the upazila polls. The party men executed the plan in almost all the 38 polling centers in the upazila, forcing both the BNP-backed and AL rebel chairman aspirants to boycott the polls. Party insiders said AL strongman Abul Hasanat Abdullah, cousin of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, masterminded the plan to ensure victory for party favourite Golam Mortuja Khan in the election. There was hardly any voter in most of the polling centres after 10:00am.
Should Newspapers Give Readers the Power to Hide News They Don't Want to See? The Guardian has created a tool that lets readers disappear Olympics coverage, raising questions about the role of editors in an age of self-curation. Click the arrows to toggle between "Before" and "After" screenshots of The Guardian's homepage. The Guardian has played this card before, allowing readers a similar option during the royal wedding last April. Such tools acknowledge that not every reader wants in on the mania -- that some stories become so hot, so omnipresent, readers would like a mute button.
This is in response to Wyatt Till’s letter “Should we worry?” of March 29. I agree with him that hydraulic fracturing has certainly become a debatable topic. I compliment him on being part of the Project Citizen Group. What I disagree with is that as a student he should have researched the subject of his letter and found that the content of fracturing fluids is generally known. Wikipedia states “The fluid injected into the rock is typically slurry of water, proppants and chemical additives. Additionally, gels, foams and compressed gases, including nitrogen, carbon dioxide and air can be injected.
A million dollar grant will help the Burlington Electric Department provide financing to customers for energy efficiency projects. Voters in Burlington go to the polls Tuesday to decide whether the city should invest in smart grid technology. Supporters say that new technology would improve energy efficiency by decreasing demand. Opponents argue it is dangerous and costly. The city-owned Burlington Electric Department says it is a step closer to achieving its goal of being 100 percent renewable by 2016. A wood-burning power plant in Burlington is celebrating its 25th birthday with an announcement that an anti-pollution device it installed in 2008 is paying off.
NorthWestern Energy Corp.’s bid to buy 11 hydroelectric dams in the Treasure State would bring a bit of déjà vu to Montana, returning a major source of power generation to the state’s dominant electric utility. Utility deregulation in Montana in 1997, deemed a disaster by many, resulted in Montana Power Co.’s transformation to a telecommunications company. Montana Power sold its Billings and Colstrip coal-fired power plants and the hydroelectric dams to PPL Corp. NorthWestern bought Montana Power’s transmission and distribution system in 2002 and MPC, by then known as Touch America Holdings Inc., folded the next year.
Washington knows full well what Israel’s national and security interests are, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. Washington knows full well what Israel’s national and security interests are, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, dismissing as premature media reports about details of the Trump administration’s plans for Israeli-Palestinian peace. Israeli politicians immediately reacted to reports of the plan, with Agriculture Minister Uri Ariel (Bayit Yehudi) threatening that his party would leave the government coalition. Bayit Yehudi opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, but its head, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, was quiet in the aftermath of the reports.
THE tourism industry in London is struggling to compete with the Olympic games, businesses claimed yesterday. They said London 2012 had turned the city into a “ghost town”. A number of tourist hotspots have reported a decline in ticket sales. Theatre companies say they are seeing a “mixed picture”. Mark Rubinstein, president of the Society of London Theatre, said: “Normally tourists will visit central London but they are mostly here to see the Games. “The message about travel problems also seems to have kept people away. My experience is things are running smoothly and people should not be put off.
Dr. Burrill B. Crohn, a leading gastroenterologist whose work greatly advanced the understanding of ileitis -also known as Crohn's disease - died yesterday at the New Milford (Conn.) Hospital. He was 99 years old and lived in New Milford and Manhattan. For most of his professional life, Dr. Crohn was associated with the Mount Sinai Medical Center. It was there, with two associates, that in 1932 he produced a report hailed as a major advance in the identification and definition of ileitis, an inflammation of the intestinal tract. Joining in the preparation and writing of the report were Dr. Leon Ginzburg and Dr. Gordon Oppenheimer.
The modern campus boasts five-star facilities and is recognized as the #MostHappeningCampus in Malaysia. 2018 has been a remarkable year for Sunway University filled with significant achievements and the ongoing forging of global allegiances which help maintain the institution's reputation as “A Class Above” when it comes to tertiary education in Malaysia. The recently published international QS Asia Rankings 2019 saw the university rise to 232nd placing – a progressive jump of 33 places – and it was only the start of things to come as the university also achieved an overall five-star rating in the QS Stars University Ratings (2018-2021).
Barack Obama became the 44th president of the United States of America on January 20, 2009. He is the country's first African-American president. In the 2008 election, Obama, the Democratic party nominee, defeated John McCain, the Republican party candidate. With a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas, President Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961. He was raised with help from his grandfather, who served in Patton's army, and his grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management at a bank.
Pope Francis delivered another criticism of some members of his own Church on Thursday, suggesting it is better to be an atheist than one of “many” Catholics who he said lead hypocritical double lives. “There are those who say, ‘I am very Catholic, I always go to Mass, I belong to this and that association,'” the head of the 1.2 billion-member Roman Catholic Church said, according to a Vatican Radio transcript. Since his election in 2013, Francis has often told Catholics, both priests and lay people, to practice what their religion preaches.
Stanford has now has an offensive tackle taken in four of the last five drafts, with Murphy joining Andrus Peat (first round, 2015), Cameron Fleming (fourth round, 2014) and Jonathan Martin (second round, 2012). The Cardinal have now seen seven offensive linemen taken in the last five drafts as well. Murphy is the fifth Stanford player to hear his name called, joining Joshua Garnett (San Francisco), Austin Hooper (Atlanta), Blake Martinez (Green Bay) and Kevin Hogan (Kansas City).
Gazprom is ready to supply Ukraine prepaid volumes of gas while the issue of old debt is to be resolved through the courts, says the Russian energy minister. Moscow is demanding Kiev pay for gas supplied to eastern regions, or face another legal wrangle. “Regarding debt payments – we are in court with them [Kiev]. We currently have a prepayment system. As far as I am aware, they have paid $30 million, which means we will supply gas paid for with this money,” Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said on Saturday.
I agree. We need shared vision to inspire hope, incorporate the seeds of the future in the present and illuminate a path to where we want to wind up. Here is a summary of a longer essay, “Taking Up The Task,” available on the ZNet website. Our goal ought to be a classless economy. In such an economy, everyone would be equally able to participate, utilize their capacities and accrue income. Private ownership of productive assets must be gone, but so too must a division of labor that affords some producers far greater influence and income than others.
May 6, 2013  In elementary school, girls often outperform boys on reading and math tests. Many factors shape academic performance, but two economists say one reason for the disparity might be that parents spend more time reading with girls and teaching them the alphabet and numbers. April 29, 2013  In scans of sleeping infants' brains, certain areas light up when they hear angry voices. But is that heightened activation damaging, or does it mean the children are learning to cope? April 15, 2013  Is periodic humiliation an inevitable feature of motherhood?
For five years The Chronicle has compiled a Top 100 restaurant list, and each year it gets a little harder to limit our selections. This year I wanted to call it the Top 115, but it just didn't quite have the same ring. The list is designed to showcase a wide variety of restaurants in terms of cuisine, price and location. That presents a challenge: Do we leave out an expensive place in the city to include an inexpensive place in Berkeley? We tried our best to cover all the bases, but in the end it came down to food quality.
In the spring of 1959, at a secretive meeting at a yacht club in Cairo, Venezuela’s then-minister of mines and hydrocarbons, Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso, hatched a plan to give big oil-producing countries more control over their black gold — and a greater share of the wealth it promised to create. A year later, his scheme would be formally christened the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. Venezuela, which sits atop what are arguably the biggest petroleum reserves in the world, was the only non-Middle Eastern country to be included — a testament to its importance to the global oil business.
Ariana Grande gave her fans a treat by performing unreleased song She Got Her Own during her concert in Washington, D.C. on Monday (25Mar19). The Thank U, Next singer originally teased the tune by posting a snippet on Snapchat in 2016, but never released it. However, during her latest Sweetener World Tour stop, Ariana finally decided to share the song in full with the help of her good friend and collaborator Victoria Monet. Ariana later shared footage on Instagram of them singing the surprise track on top of a pink car.
Will tax havens fall apart? Swiss banking major UBS AG figures as the “master client” for several offshore entities floated by Indians in tax havens such as British Virgin Islands (BVI), according to the database put up by the International Consortium Of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). Master client refers to an intermediary or go-between, which helps a client set up an offshore entity. While UBS AG’s London unit helped Mallya set up Venture New Holding in BVI in 2006, the bank’s Singapore unit was the master client of Lohia’s Golden Charm Universal, a BVI-based standard international company.
One Metro train rear-ended another Tuesday morning — a separate incident from the derailment of track equipment several hours earlier. WASHINGTON — One Metro train rear-ended another Tuesday morning — a separate incident from the derailment of track equipment several hours earlier. In this case, trains in the New Carrollton Rail Yard in Prince George’s County were preparing to go into service on the Orange Line around 5:19 a.m., Metro said in a statement to WTOP. While one train was stopped, another came too close and the couplers at the front of the striking train and the back of the stopped train came into contact.
President Donald Trump has turned Republicanism on its head. A party that once stood for free trade has a president who loves tariffs. A party that championed free enterprise has a president out to punish companies he doesn’t like. A party that stood for the rule of law has a president who attacks his own Justice Department. And now this. A party that has long preached limited government, free expression and deregulation now has an administration pondering a politically motivated investigation of social media intended to justify a new wave of regulations.
WWE’s “WrestleMania 35” will be held at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium in 2019, TheWrap is told by multiple individuals with knowledge of the booking. The official announcement is expected soon. The pro-wrestling promotion had been planning a mid-to-late February announcement for months, we’re told. Any later and the company would run into its “WrestleMania 34” promotion, which could cause confusion among casual fans. But WWE prefers to make their big announcements locally when talent is already in town — that makes sense logistically and saves money on travel.
FRANKFORT, Ky. – More than 100,000 Kentuckians can mark another item off their shopping lists: medical coverage. Kentucky’s state-operated online insurance marketplace has had a rush of people signing up for policies over the past month so that they would receive coverage beginning Jan. 1. Gwenda Bond, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky Health Benefit Exchange, said officials had geared up for the anticipated surge. More than 500,000 people have conducted pre-screenings to determine their eligibility for discounts, government subsidies or Medicaid coverage through Kentucky’s online insurance marketplace. As of Monday afternoon, 74,054 people had enrolled in Medicaid and 26,042 in private health insurance plans.
At the Met Gala in Manhattan tonight, one model will be wearing a “cognitive dress”: A gown, designed by fashion house Marchesa, that will shift in color based on input from IBM’s Watson supercomputer. The dress features gauzy white roses, each embedded with an LED that will display different colors depending on the general sentiment of tweets about the Met Gala. The algorithm powering the dress relies on Watson Color Theory, which links emotions to colors, and on the Watson Tone Analyzer, a service that can detect emotion in text.
MANILA, Jan. 17 (PIA) -- At least 10 police, military and civilians who defied the government’s campaign against indiscriminate firing of guns during the holidays now face charges as Interior and Local Government Secretary Jesse M. Robredo vowed to impose the full might of the law against them. “I am not going to tolerate those who indiscriminately fired their guns before, after and during the holidays, particularly police officers who defied our ban. Once investigation results indicate we have prima facie cases against them, they will be dismissed from the service,” Robredo said.
We just saw a great product at the TC Disrupt Hack Day. It’s basically a class action lawsuit generator against AT&T that uses your actual call drop data to tabulate how many times your phone crashed and how many times you’ve been generally hosed by AT&T. The site is worstphoneever.com and it searches for baseband crashes on your desktop, uploads them, and saves them to a database. The results are tabulated and added to the total, eventually leading to a detailed class-action lawsuit. Do you have an iPhone?
An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.0 has struck near Anchorage, Alaska, causing widespread damage, triggering rock slides and alarming office workers who plunged under their desks. A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Friday morning near Anchorage, Alaska, causing widespread damage, and alarming office workers who plunged under their desks. No deaths or injuries have yet been reported. Light fixtures fell, glass shattered, roadways collapsed and supermarket aisles were littered with fallen boxes, cans and jars. One man tweeted a photo of his toppled chimney and a local television station showed its studio filled with debris.

OVERJOYED: New parents Crystal and Nathan Mills have had two sleepless nights, but couldn't be happier with their new family member. Newborn baby Mac Mills timed his entrance to the world perfectly to coincide with his great-grandmother’s 93rd birthday. Born at Katherine Hospital on October 9 at 6.07pm, baby Mills kept first-time parents, Crystal and Nathan Mills, waiting for days. “He really hung out for those extra hours to be born on the same day as my grandmother,” Mr Mills said. NEW BORN: Mac Mills was born at Katherine Hospital on October 9 at 6.07pm.
Happy spring, folks. Well, I guess it depends on which day. Of course the weekend of the 6th and 7th was lovely. Sunny and beautiful. The next few days ... errr not so much. In last week’s column I mentioned Dover's 400th Anniversary Committee on the 15th. Big ooops! There is a meeting tonight at Dover Public Library, but it is for the Historical Society. Check them out at 7 p.m. Speaking of the 400th, there really is a public forum coming up on the May 2 at 7 p.m. in the new Dover High School auditorium.
Eli Kaspo, with his wife Gemma and daughter, is one of the Assyrians killed in the Qamishli bombings of three Assyrian restaurants. Qamishli, Syria (AINA) -- Three explosions targeted Assyrian businesses in Qamishli, Syria today. The first was at the Miami restaurant and the second at the Gabriel restaurant, both owned by Assyrians. The restaurants are in an Assyrian neighborhood and commercial district in the center of the city. The explosions at Miami and Gabriel restaurants occurred within minutes of each other. A third attack targeted the Youth Restaurant, in the western part of Qamishli, which is also owned by Assyrians.
Tema, June 17, GNA - The visiting French Minister of State for Co-operation and Francophone Development, Mr Xavier Darcos on Thursday pledged France's support in the development of infrastructure in Ghana. He stressed the need for both countries to deepen the bonds of friendship and further strengthen relations between them. Mr Darcos made the pledge when he inspected the ongoing French-sponsored 64 metre-long Tema Manhean-Ashiaman road overpass project, on the Accra-Tema Motroway. The inspection was part of his two-day visit to Ghana. The 20 million-Euro project funded with a French Development Agency Loan is being undertaken by Messrs Sonitra to ease vehicular traffic between Tema and Ashiaman.

SEATTLE – Sounders and U.S. national team forward Clint Dempsey is undergoing medical evaluations for an irregular heartbeat, the club announced Friday, and has been ruled out for this Sunday’s match at Portland at the very least. A more specific recovery timetable – be it for early next month, later this season or beyond – is on hold until Dempsey undergoes further testing. Dempsey, 33, played in all 90 minutes of Seattle’s 3-1 win against Portland last Sunday at CenturyLink Field but did not travel with the team to its midweek game at Houston.
DUNEDIN, FLA.—Union head Tony Clark lauded the Toronto Blue Jays on Monday for giving minor league players a 50 per cent raise, and he hopes other clubs do the same. Representatives from the players’ association visited the Blue Jays spring training camp a day after The Athletic reported the team planned to boost pay for all minor leaguers, some making as little as $1,100 a month during the five-month season. By comparison, the major league minimum is $550,000 (U.S.) per year, and the top players make over $30 million annually.
BUFFALO – Andrew Cuomo yesterday capped a bitter behindthe-scenes battle by romping to a smashing state Democratic convention victory over rival Mark Green to become the party’s official designee for attorney general. Cuomo, the ex-federal housing secretary and son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, captured an unexpectedly lopsided 67 percent of the overall delegate vote in his bid to replace current AG Eliot Spitzer. Green and three lesser-known candidates each failed to secure the needed 25 percent of the vote to ensure an automatic place on the Sept. 12 primary ballot, with Green garnering just 19 percent.
For close to 30 years, French pianist Laurent de Wilde has been at the forefront of European jazz, leading dual explorations in both acoustic and experimental electronic music. French pianist Laurent de Wilde has been at the forefront of European jazz for almost 30 years. Leading dual explorations in both acoustic and experimental electronic music, he has produced more than 15 albums in contrasting styles, following early breaks recording alongside American legends including Eddie Henderson, Billy Drummond and Jack DeJohnette. Originally planned for November last year, de Wilde’s debut Middle Eastern tour was cancelled at the last minute after the terrorist attacks in Paris.
John Pritchard Higby, 70, died at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City, on September 19, 2018. John will be especially remembered for his hard work, generosity, and sense of humor. Born on November 13th, 1947, in Cedar Falls, Iowa, to Pritchard and Henrietta (Tjebkes) Higby, he attended Cedar Falls High School and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics from the University of Northern Iowa in 1974. John served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War from 1969 until 1972 as a cartographic drafter, stationed in Pearl Harbor.
the score was 21-12, so a field goal would have cut the lead to one possession. Johnson talked about Harrison Butker yesterday, saying he was confident in him and makes his kicks in practice. Further, for whatever it's worth, Butker's troubles seem to come in closer range. not even pondering how not rotating B-backs until they fumble/get hurt ruined our chances for an exceptional season, why go for a long FG against Duke with an inconsistent kicker down 2 TDs & not stopping them in any event? I think just beaten out.
REGARDLESS of which parties make it to parliament after the upcoming general elections, the construction of highways should not slow down in Slovakia. All major political parties see the completion of the D1 highway connecting Bratislava and Žilina and further to Košice as their priority, the Pravda daily writes. Only the Free Forum proposes to re-evaluate whether the construction of the southern connection to Košice would be more advantageous. A majority of political parties want to complete the northern route of the D1 highway through Žilina to Košice by 2012, although no party has given guarantees.
World Series midgame running. Will be topped at game's end. Shane Victorino broke a scoreless tie in the third inning in a big way, whacking a three-run double off the Green Monster in left field with two outs off Cardinals starter Michael Wacha. Jacoby Ellsbury led off with a single and moved to second on Dustin Pedroia's groundout. The Cardinals then decided to intentionally walk David Ortiz, who was 11-for-15 with five walks in the series to that point. Wacha struck out Mike Napoli but kept the inning alive by hitting Jonny Gomes with a pitch.
There's a LOT going on this weekend, and we're here to help you get a handle on it all (especially now that our idea for an Easter Bunny flash mob isn't panning out). So here are seven ways to have a blast in the S.F. Bay Area and beyond this weekend, from Easter awesomeness to a heck of a hip-hop show to a craft-beer blowout in Martinez. This weekend brings plenty of Easter merriment, and whether you're looking for awesome brunches, family-friendly events and even Passover events, we've got the complete roundup here.
South African Under-20 national team coach Thabo Senong has named a provisional squad of 28 players for this year’s Cosafa Championship to take place in Zambia next month. Senong‚ who was part of technical team for the U-17 women’s national team during their disappointing World Cup in Uruguay last week‚ said the camp will give him a clear indication on which players to pick for the tournament. Amajita report for camp on Friday to start preparations for the tournament that will run from December 2 to 14. The defending champions are in Group B with Namibia‚ Mauritius and Swaziland.
The first decade of the 21st century certainly was a miserable financial experience for many people. People who gambled too much money on new Internet stocks were scorched when the dot-com bubble burst. People who shouldn’t have been able to buy a home were given no-document/no-money-down loans. People who had only hazy notions of home financing signed up for adjustable rate mortgages and then reacted in panic and dismay as the rates automatically adjusted upward (one escalator you don’t want to be on). The point: watch what you do; weigh what you do; keep your exposure to risk as low as possible.
Meet our mech. He's real, and we're going to show you how the wizards at Legacy Effects put him together. This is no static display piece. Everything about this mech actually works, and it is stomping around Comic-Con right now. It all has to fit together perfectly when you're building a mech, so all the pieces are carefully trimmed and finished for a precise fit. Legacy's Rob Ramsdell fits a piece of armor above the mech's pecs. Stilts? Pfft. An exoskeleton is so much more WIRED. Bruce Mitchell gets a little help becoming 9.5 feet tall.
Thank’s for the Memories Fremont Fair! The 42nd annual Fremont Fair was a smashing success. Hundreds of thousands of people flocked to the “Center of the Universe” to celebrate the longest day of the year and the first weekend of Seattle summer. The bustling beer gardens, the rockin’ live music, the out-of-this-world food, and the unique shopping vendors was the exact recipe for a perfect weekend. Three days of live music across three stages: The entire Fair was filled with good beats and catchy tunes from start until finish.
Though the sun lies 93 million miles (149 million kilometers) from Earth, its unceasing activity assures an impact on our planet far beyond the obvious light and heat. From a constant stream of particles in the form of solar wind to the unpredictable bombardment from solar flares and coronal mass ejections, Earth often feels the effects of its stellar companions. Less noticeable are the sunspots crossing the solar surface, though they are related to the more violent interactions. All of these fall under the definition of "space weather." Studying the surface of the sun can reveal small, dark areas that vary in number and location.
A message has been sent – loud and clear – by Microsoft at today’s Surface Pro 3 event: go big or go home. Windows RT and the smaller tablet universe will be going home, at this point, as the strategy for Microsoft with the Surface Pro 3 will be getting larger. This doesn’t mean that the Surface Pro 3 will be so massive it won’t be able to fit in your backpack, of course. Not by a long shot. In fact, Microsoft is aiming directly for the Apple-made MacBook Air with the Surface Pro 3.
Since the sell-off in January and mid-February, the U.S. stock market has been experiencing a relief rally as investors hope for more stimulus from global central banks. On February 10th, I tweeted that central banks may create a "bogus, temporary rally off key support levels like SP500's 1,800." So far, this is exactly what has happened. I've been skeptical of this rebound because none of the bearish market drivers in January have been fixed: Deutsche Bank and UBS' stock and bond carnage, the deflating tech/biotech bubble, coming energy sector defaults, junk bond pain, and much more.
The Palestinian Authority may backtrack on its intention to appeal for a unilateral declaration of statehood if Israel concedes to negotiations based on a state within the 1967 borders, Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization Yasser Abed Rabbo said Monday. Arab Uprisings in West Bank? West Bank conference: Intifada possible in Sept.
Abed Rabbo told the London-based al-Hayyat that the PA is still determined to appeal to the UN on the matter, but will withdraw the demand upon the beginning of "real and serious negotiations based on the 1967 borders, which includes limited border corrections without exchanges of populations, and which will terminate in September".
Stopping nearsightedness in kids and more. This week, Dr. Sydney Spiesel discusses a way to stop the progression of nearsightedness in kids, a better method of hormone replacement therapy for women after menopause, and new developments in the search for a cause for autism. His column will start appearing a couple of times a month. Condition: Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the most common eye problem. In the United States and Europe, about 25 percent of the adult population is nearsighted, and in much of Asia the condition is more common still. Significant myopia can have serious medical consequences.
French Montana was the victim of a home invasion at his $3.3 million California mansion this morning (July 31). ABC 7 has confirmed at least two armed robbers broke into French's Calabasas home early on Tuesday. Los Angeles County sheriff's officials were called to the gated community where French lives around 9 a.m., several hours after the crime allegedly took place. It's unclear whether any of French's personal items were stolen, but one victim claims the robbers took personal property from the residence. The robbers may have taken off on foot, and unfortunately there aren't any leads yet on where they may be.
Cricket West Indies has announced that Sandals Resorts has agreed a long-term contract to become the new principal partner and team sponsor of the Windies. The news follows the successful Hurricane Relief T20 Challenge at Lord’s, which raised money for the destination. The new partnership is effective immediately and will cover all Windies’ teams from U-15s through to the senior men’s and women’s teams. As part of the agreement Sandals will have their logo inscribed on all Windies playing and training clothing, as well as benefiting from activating Windies cricket in their marketing and social responsibility programmes.
An abandoned home in far South Austin is on tap to become the South Austin Beer Garden, a family-friendly spot hoping to welcome its first customers in April. The opening will be the culmination of a five-year process for the SABG team, which includes hospitality industry vets David Pearce, Ryan Thomas, and Christopher Cantu. The home at 10700 Manchaca Rd. is somewhat famous — or perhaps infamous — in the area. The structure was originally built in downtown Austin, and then moved from its original lot to its current location in the 1970s.
Back in the 1950s—the “Happy Days” of American society—people didn’t talk about the value of community much. They didn’t need to, because they lived it. Most people lived in tight nuclear families, they knew their neighbors, they belonged to neighborhood churches, they participated in local Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops, they were members of school clubs and local service organizations like the Rotary Club, and people chose a career and stuck with it, often staying at the same job for all their adult life. These were all communities within communities connected to other communities.
NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. -- “I have mixed emotions about the recent final siting plan released by the Department of Environmental Conservation. While I am pleased the DEC’s principle finding reinforces my position and that of many local residents that there is no need for additional hazardous waste management facilities or expanded hazardous waste capacity in Niagara County or New York State, I am disappointed that the plan fails to give any potential Siting Board meaningful guidance on the question of equitable distribution. The DEC has consistently failed to differentiate between the types of hazardous waste facilities.
What do a 66-year-old British New Wave veteran and a 49-year-old Jamaican pop-reggae artist have in common? More than you might think, says Sting, who hooked up with Shaggy for the collaborative album, 44/876 – named for the U.K. and Jamaican area codes, respectively – out Friday (April 20). The two musicians, who are touring separately this summer but would love to tour together at some point, were introduced by Sting’s manager who was Shaggy’s former A&R executive. “Everybody’s surprised by our collaboration” admits the one-time frontman-bassist of ‘70s rock-reggae band The Police.

WASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said on Monday that the United States wanted a ceasefire in Afghanistan during Eidul Azha because this was also the desire of the Afghan people. The Afghan government announced on Sunday that it wanted a ceasefire in the country during this Eid like the one that was observed during Eidul Fitr, which allowed rival Afghan factions, particularly the Taliban, to celebrate the religious festival peacefully with their families. But Mr Pompeo and Afghan officials both said that for this ceasefire to happen, it was necessary for the Taliban to desire it as well.
Before Jamie Foxx stars in the thriller White House Down with Channing Tatum, let's take a trip back to 2004 to the most iconic thriller film of his career, Collateral, which skyrocketed his film career. As a stand-up comedian and primarily comedic actor, Foxx's character in Collateral as the diffident, wavering cab driver "Max Durocher" was a considerable change of pace for him. "Michael Mann (director) calls and says, 'Can you play a cab driver?' I said, 'C'mon man, I do my thing.'
Special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe report didn't find sufficient evidence to charge anyone from President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign with conspiracy for coordinating with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Since May 2017, special counsel Robert Mueller investigated Russian government interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow. There are at least 101 known points of contact between people associated with the Trump campaign and Russian government-linked individuals or entities from November of 2015 all the way up to January of 2017. Here is the full timeline of all the Trump campaign and transition team's communications with Russia.
Saakashvili accuses Moscow of trying to "change Europe's borders by force". Neave Barker, reporting for Al Jazeera from Moscow, said: "There is very little that Saakashvili’s government can do at the moment apart from attempting to solidify support inside his own country. "What he's doing right now is attempting to galvanise a sense of statehood, a sense of national unity and he's using the greater international community - Europe, the United States, international institutions like Nato and the EU to try and give his leadership a degree of weight."
The iconic City of Angels is not just for the rich and famous. Sure, LA is home to many movie stars and music geniuses.

Arsenal fans have already sold Nasri. With the artistic update of the song devoted to the splendour or Sami Nasri&apos;s superb six months last season, the travelling Arsenal fans gave up on the Frenchman on Saturday and accepted Man City&apos;s offer regardless of what Arsene Wenger and the board think. "Na na na na na na na na, Sami you&apos;re a c**t, you&apos;re a c**t, Sami you&apos;re a c**t".
Communication and compensation were some of the issues raised by Canterbury farmers dealing with Mycoplasma bovis phased eradication at meetings in Ashburton in early November. The meetings were part of a nationwide plan to garner feedback from farmers under regulatory control. A similar meeting was held in Hamilton and others were planned for Invercargill and Oamaru. Ministry for Primary Industries' Mycoplasma bovis director Geoff Gwyn said about 25 M. bovis-affected farmers attended two farmer meetings in Ashburton on November 9. There were also managers from the newly established M. bovis Directorate, industry partners, as well as a veterinary epidemiologist working on the response and members of the MPI compensation team.
It's decision time for college admissions offices, and no doubt many applicants will soon be rejected by their first-choices--if they're lucky. That's right. I've come to see that rejection by a college is a blessing. I have spent years tracking college applicants, first as a journalist and then as an alumni interviewer for Brown University. I've watched dozens of kids agonize after being rebuffed by brand-name schools from Princeton to Stanford. And yet when I check in with them a year or two later, inevitably they're blissfully settled at their second- or third-choice school.
At the Left Forum this May 29-31 in New York City, Fight Imperialism, Stand Together — FIST — participated in a debate with other socialist organizations on the character that anti-imperialist struggle must take in this period. This debate is central to the overall struggle for liberation in a period when imperialism is openly destroying whole areas of the planet. FIST remains firm in asserting that the primary role of revolutionaries in the U.S. is to defend and fight for the self-determination of oppressed nations in conflict with imperialism, especially U.S., West European and Japanese imperialism.

HALIFAX — A Halifax cab driver has been convicted of sexually assaulting a female passenger last summer. Saher Hamdan, 29, sexually assaulted a young woman as she waited to pay her fare on July 15, 2016, trying to kiss her and touching her sexually without her consent. He was convicted Wednesday in Halifax provincial court, and will be sentenced Oct. 13. The case came at a time of heightened anxiety — Halifax police said in 2016 there had been 14 reported sexual assault cases involving taxi drivers over the previous four years.

MMD National Youth Secretary, Bowman Lusambo has petitioned the Zambia Police to summon veteran politician Vernon Mwaanga to explain the vote rigging statement attributed to him. Mr. Lusambo says he feels duty bound as a citizen to petition the Police because the rigging statement attributed to Dr. Mwaanga is a threat to peace and national security. He told journalist after a closed door meeting with the police intelligence unit that Dr. Mwaanga must explain how governments have been rigging elections. Mr. Lusambo said the statement is likely to cause voter apathy and discontent during and after elections. Mr. Lusambo is confident that the police will do a good job over his petition.
We spent a good part of last week at the Management of Change conference, held this year in Richmond, Va., and sponsored by the American Council for Technology and the Industry Advisory Council. Kevin Carroll started his career in government as a contracting officer and over the past 30 years rose in prominence to lead multibillion-dollar programs that supply the Army with most of its hardware and software needs. Carroll, the Army’s program executive officer in the Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems, learned the value of communication, collaboration and keeping a strong sense of humor throughout his career.
LOS ANGELES (AP)  Tina Fey, Angela Bassett, Jada Pinkett Smith, Cynthia Nixon and Kathie Lee Gifford are being recognized for their media achievements. The Alliance for Women in Media Foundation said Monday that it will honor the five women at its 41st annual Gracie Awards in May. Foundation Chairwoman Kristen Welch said the entertainers will be honored because their success on both sides of the camera encourages future generations of women to pursue media careers. They will be recognized at a gala ceremony at May 24 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. The event will raise funds for the foundation’s scholarships and educational programs.

In federal-provincial relations, as in life, one rarely gets a second chance to make a good first impression. Quebec Premier François Legault is apparently on a mission to validate that truism at his own expense. A little more than 100 days since his government’s swearing-in, Legault is fast earning the reputation of a bull in the federal-provincial china shop. So far he has more broken glass than anything else to show for his approach. On his first federal-provincial appearance at last December’s first ministers’ conference, Legault got off on the wrong foot with a number of his fellow premiers by cavalierly dismissing their pro-pipeline agenda.
President Donald Trump called 12 Senate Democrats on Tuesday, courting their votes on his tax bill that will mostly benefit wealthy people. To the surprise of the Democrats, Trump tried selling the bill by telling them that he would personally "get killed" financially by the legislation. "My accountant called me and said 'you're going to get killed in this bill,'" the president said in a phone call from South Korea, according to NBC News. He also said that the proposed repeal of the estate tax was necessary in order to keep wealthy people happy, NBC News reported.
Amid the shifting contours of President Donald Trump’s Syria policy, one constant has been the role of Turkey. When Trump announced last month the withdrawal of 2,000 U.S. special operations forces from Syria, he did so after a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Trump’s plans undermined the previously stated policy of senior U.S. officials. Now it appears that Trump’s reversal is not quite so dramatic. On Monday, National Security Adviser John Bolton told reporters in Jerusalem that the withdrawal would be based on conditions — such as the protection of Kurdish allies and the defeat of the Islamic State.
The University of California is scrambling to make room for the largest enrollment boost of California undergraduates in years — 6,500 more for the fall 2016 term, with the most selective campuses taking the most new students. UCLA, Berkeley, San Diego and Riverside will each accept 750 more students this year; systemwide, nearly 14% more state residents are expected to gain admission. That's good news for nervous high school seniors and transfer students who competed against 206,000 others in another record-shattering year for UC applications for 2016. The expansion has pressed officials to find more housing, hire additional faculty and expand support services.
England Under-21s will stage the first leg of their play-off for next summer's European Championship at Carrow Road, the FA have announced. Norwich City's stadium will host Stuart Pearce's side as they take on Serbia on Friday, October 12 (kick-off 6pm). Details of the Under-21s' second leg have still to be announced, although it will almost certainly take place four days later. The play-off sees England attempt to secure a fourth straight finals appearance after they won their qualifying group. Norwich pair Declan Rudd and Ryan Bennett have been named in the England U21 squad for the final European Championship qualifiers in Azerbaijan and Norway.
MANCHESTER UNITED have won the race for Real Betis wonderkid Roberto Gonzalez. United were battling local rivals Manchester City for the 16-year-old forward. And, according to The Sun on Sunday newspaper, they have agreed to pay compensation for his signature. Gonzalez’s youth terms at Real Betis expire at the end of the month. The Spain Under-16 international is rated as one of the country’s hottest prospects. He will be the second young Spaniard to make the move to Old Trafford this summer. It emerged last month that United have agreed a deal to sign Espanyol starlet Arnau Puigmal.
Ambassador of Norway Thorbjørn Gaustadsæther recently made a visit to newly released Myliddi harbour area and newly resettled settlement in the Thellipalai Divisional Secretariat area in Jaffna District. When Srinu Maddula, an 18-month old baby from West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh with defective eyesight was brought to a Rotary Club eye camp in Vijayawada in 1980s, the ophthalmologists diagnosed a rare disease that had affected the kid’s cornea. The doctors suggested corneal transplant as the only solution to prevent complete blindness. One of the most priorities of the Government of Sri Lanka is to make competent people who will be participating in the national development of the country.
Andrea Levy's narrative switches between four protagonists. The first, Queenie, is Gilbert's white landlady; they met during wartime when he came over as an RAF recruit. Returning on the SS Empire Windrush, he looks her up and takes a room in her house. Hortense, the Jamaican girl whom Gilbert married immediately before boarding the boat, arrives later to share his crumbling attic room; and Queenie's long-lost husband, Bernard, finds his way back, a year after his demob, shortly after Hortense has taken up residence. The year is 1948.

A gay couple holding hands. File Photo. At the entrance of a student residence named after one of this country's most famous freedom fighters, Chris Hani, a crowd gathered to watch the bloody beating of a transgender student. A security guard working for the University of the Western Cape allegedly stood passively by, seemingly dismissive of the attack, on Sunday morning. Now Glenton Matthyse, a cross-dresser, law student and gay rights activist, has had enough of homophobic and "transphobic" behaviour on campus. Matthyse and two other transgender students were injured when they tried to fight off the three attackers.
NEW YORK (AP) — A round of strong profit outlooks fueled anticipation over next week’s first-quarter-earnings reports, sending stocks markedly higher yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 115 points, posting its second triple-digit advance in the past three sessions. Some analysts were expecting trading to be somewhat light this week before Friday’s payroll figures, given the very disappointing job growth in the previous two reports. However, the earnings outlooks were enough to keep buyers in the market, analysts said. In addition, mutual fund managers attempting to boost their portfolio returns for the quarter were more aggressive in trading.
It was an exciting African Nations Cup tournament and when the champions were crowned in Cairo’s International Stadium they approached their debut in the forthcoming World Cup on German soil with high hopes. Little did they realise that disaster awaited them. That was 1974, when Zaire powered exuberantly to victory over Zambia in the Nations Cup final held in Egypt. Three months later they left West Germany with their tails between their legs having scored no goals and conceded 14 in a disastrous World Cup campaign that fixed the image of African football’s “naivety” in the popular mind.
Retailers and publishers have fought hard to work their way up in the ranking of Google’s search results and refine the search features of their own Web sites to help users once they arrive. Now, Google is taking a greater role in helping users search within particular sites. And some of the same retailers and publishers are not happy about it. The results of the search are almost all individual company pages. Google tops those results with a link to the home page of the Web site in question, adds another search box, and offers users the chance to let Google search for certain things within that site.
By Alaina Shearer Voice Network Badge Voice Network contributor, an ongoing writer for our guest opinion column. Most Women in Digital events are for women only, but the national conference will allow 36 men. No men allowed. It’s the common thread, the secret sauce so to speak, behind every one of our meetings in every city. Now a national organization growing at a pace we can barely contain, Women in Digital is on a mission to connect as many women on the tech and digital side of advertising and marketing as possible.
There will be plenty of questions surrounding USC sophomore quarterback Aaron Corp next season, namely about the idea of playing in front of more than 102,000 at Ohio State in the second game of the season. Or should there be? Corp has never started a college football game, but history suggests nerves should not be an issue. That was evident during Corp’s junior year at Orange Lutheran High School, when USC coach Pete Carroll showed up with then-assistant coaches Steve Sarkisian and Lane Kiffin to watch Corp throw for the first time. The composure has carried over to USC.
I was asked to write down a topic and bring it along in a sealed envelopepe. My topic was Amy Winehouse and from it came a brilliant off-the-cuff musical set in a Spanish vinyard that Amy had drunk dry. The improvisation is real. The songs are funny and flawless and through what must be finely-tuned leadership and trust, The Maydays managed to tell a story which had a beginning, a middle and an end. The rest of the two-hour set was mainly on-stage drama practice techniques. The Maydays also presented a ten-minute sketch about a trustafarian on day release who couldn't pack a picnic.
— Charlie Crist on Tuesday, October 5th, 2010 in a TV ad. By Aaron Sharockman on Wednesday, October 6th, 2010 at 5:41 p.m.
Marco Rubio is proposing changes to Social Security, but not for current beneficiaries or people close to retirement. Charlie Crist's latest attack ad targets Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio and hits on a touchy subject for elderly Floridians: Social Security. The 30-second ad aims to sway votes in a key demographic. Florida's 60 and older population makes up more than 30 percent of registered voters, and more than 40 percent voters who cast ballots in 2006.
The Diciotti, which picked up the migrants. Italian Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli called for EU sanctions against Malta on Sunday for failing to pick up migrants which were on a boat which transited the Malta rescue zone. But Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who referred to the case before Mr Toninelli made his comments, insisted that Malta was on the right side of international law. He explained on One Radio that the boat, carrying 171 people, transited international waters which Malta is responsible for with regard to rescues. A Maltese patrol boat monitored it. The migrants’ boat was not in distress and the migrants refused help.
Things got hairy at the Just for Men National Beard and Moustache Championships in Nashville, Tennessee, earlier this month. The bird was the word in this peacock-style approach taken by the man known as "Incredibeard." Eighteen national championship titles, including awards for the Musketeer look, the famed Fu Manchu and the Amish beard, were handed out at Just For Men's competition. Garey Faulkner boasted real goggles atop his hat, and goggle shapes appeared in his beard as well. Why should James McMahon have just one mustache when he can celebrate three?
SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas - With 26 people dead and 20 people injured at the hands of New Braunfels resident Devin Patrick Kelley, a shooting a the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs has gone down as the deadliest shooting in Texas history. Here's everything we know about the shooting. Authorities said Kelley walked into the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs at 216 4th Street around 11:30 a.m. Sunday and opened fire on the congregation killing 26 and injuring 20 others. YouTube videos of previous sermons indicate the church maintains a congregation of about 50 people.
Chance, in the course of a verse, a song, or an album, always seems to be stretching toward something new, something else. The third mixtape by Chance the Rapper, “Coloring Book,” begins with the sound of a trumpet. Soon subtly harmonized, the horn (played by Chance’s constant sideman and alter-ego, Donnie Trumpet) teeters between controlled and offhanded play, tumbling almost accidentally into short, congested melismas. The impression is of an excited warmup, less an announcement than the happy hurry that precedes one.
"I have collected trees over the last 17 years from gardens that I was building or houses that I was building," Mr. Enea said. "Trees had to be moved, and instead of cutting them, I tried to remove them." "it is often the desire of our architecture to establish and accentuate gardens and surrounding vistas that heighten the appreciation of nature-- so it was quite natural for us to make Enea's gardens the star of the show. We are always working towards creating the space for the beauty of the natural world to take center stage.
The studio legal affairs veteran will serve as executive vp and deputy general counsel under Wayne Levin. Lionsgate has tapped former Sony Pictures Entertainment exec Audrey Lee to negotiate M&As under key studio dealmaker Wayne Levin. Lee, as executive vp and deputy general counsel, will also tackle legal issues for Lionsgate’s SVOD channels and digital initiatives, location-based entertainment and marketing and promotions.

A cool front moved south this evening. We saw an eight-degree temperature drop in one hour earlier this evening. The temperatures are falling slowly, as are the dewpoint temperatures, and the winds are out of the north. Temperatures will be cool but seasonable in the morning in the 50s. The humidity will be lower through Tuesday but will return with our rain chances by Wednesday morning. Highs will be warmer inland in the low to mid 70s on Tuesday. Highs will settle in the upper 60s to low 70s along the coast. St. Patrick’s Day weekend looks cooler with highs in the low 60s.
Katherine Rae Stallings, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles E. Stallings of Rumson, N.J., was married yesterday at the Episcopal Church of the Transfiguration in New York to Jonathan Peter Bren, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Peter M. Bren of New York. The Rev. Charles S. Temple performed the ceremony. Mrs. Bren, a graduate of the Hotchkiss School and Trinity College in Hartford, is studying for an M.B.A. at Columbia University. She is a first vice president of Integrated Resources, a financial services company in New York.
As recently reported in the DNJ, the Rutherford County Republican Party is seeking to have state law changed to introduce partisan elections to the Rutherford County School Board, the Murfreesboro City School Board, the Murfreesboro City Council, the Smyrna Town Council, the La Vergne Board of Aldermen, and the Eagleville City Council. This would involve a change to the charters of these governing entities. This request has been made by letter from GOP Chairwoman Donna Barrett to Rutherford County’s delegation in the state legislature. Barrett’s stated reasoning is the “issue of rights” of a candidate to state their party affiliation.
HARRISBURG, Pa. - Serena and Frosten get pampered with showers and blow dryers like most females, except they are purebred shorthorn beef cattle. Frosten won "shorthorn reserve junior champion female" for Kevin Stahl of Mercersburg, Pa., on Friday at the Pennsylvania Farm Show. Stahl, of Slate Wind Farm, said his class was judged on the cattle's femininity and thickness. "When it's cold, they don't get washed as much as they should. ... It's been warmer this year, which makes it easier," Stahl said.
Two people were killed Monday after a freak series of collisions sent a 300-pound bear rocketing through their SUV on a rural road in Quebec. The driver of the SUV, a 25-year-old Gatineau woman, and a passenger, a 40-year-old Ottawa man, died on impact. A second passenger, the driver’s boyfriend, was sent to hospital with minor injuries. A young bear had shuffled onto Highway 148 about 50 kilometres northwest of Ottawa when it was hit by an eastbound car, said Const. Martin Fournel of the MRC des Collines-de-l’Outaouais police.
SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Immusoft Corporation, a Seattle, Wash.-based gene therapy company, announced today it has closed a $3M initial tranche of a Series B financing. The full Series B is underway. The round is expected to provide Immusoft the funding it needs to complete its Phase I/II clinical trial in MPS-I (Mucopolysaccharidoses type I) and advance its pipeline, which uses its proprietary Immune System Programming (ISP™) approach to B cell modification for treating diseases. Commensurate with this financing, biotechnology veteran Sean Ainsworth will assume the role of CEO and Chairman of the Board.
If Pluto's looking for someone  or something  to blame for being drummed out of the planetary corps back in 2006, it need look no further than Eris. The solar system's ninth planet had long had its detractors  purists who sniffed at its tiny size and irregular orbit  but it was in 2005 things came to a head. That was when Caltech astronomer Mike Brown found a tiny, frigid world orbiting some three times further out than Pluto. Brown had been finding similar objects in the Kuiper Belt  the massive band of comet-like bodies that circles the solar system  for years.

Quantum computing is real. But it's also hard. So hard that only a few developers, usually trained in quantum physics, advanced mathematics, or most likely both, can actually work with the few quantum computers that exist. Now D-Wave, the Canadian company behind the quantum computer that Google and NASA have been testing since 2013, wants to make quantum computing a bit easier through the power of open source software. Traditional computers store information in "bits," which can represent either a "1" or a "0."
Home Blotch Around Fort Worth Arts Festival? Grab An Uzi! Arts Festival? Grab An Uzi! THIS PICTURE OF "OPEN CARRY TEXAS" CHILDREN CARRYING GUNS AT MAIN STREET ARTS FESTIVAL WAS PUBLISHED ON THE MERICANS AGAINST THE TEA PARTY WEB SITE. Members of Open Carry Texas (OCT) showed up at Main Street Arts Festival on Saturday to parade around with guns. Seems like Fort Worth folks are fairly conditioned already. “We didn’t get a whole bunch of feedback on them except on twitter,” said festival spokeswoman Clair Bloxom Armstrong.
The most popular parlor game in Washington: Who will replace Tillerson? The most popular parlor game in Washington right now is speculating who will replace Rex Tillerson as President Trump's next secretary of state, a thankless job in an administration that has downgraded the role of the State Department and diplomacy overall. But two qualified and apparently willing candidates have emerged. When confronted last week with pervasive rumors that he is on the way out, Tillerson pleaded ignorance. "Who in the world is telling you that stuff?" he asked reporters from the Wall Street Journal.
Is a focus on curriculum the missing piece in the preparation of teachers? That's the argument made by in a new paper released by Education First, a global education consulting group. It's part of a project, partly funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, bringing together teacher-preparation experts from Finland, Brazil, Australia, and the United States. One of the paper's main insights is that countries like Singapore and Finland tend to base all of their preparation around vetted, high-quality curriculum in a way that the United States and other countries, like Australia, do not.
The oil industry vigorously opposed efforts to list the threatened dunes sagebrush lizard as an endangered species. But three oil company lobbyists were given day-to-day oversight of the effort to save the reptile. When Texas promised to protect a threatened lizard in the oil-rich Permian Basin, state officials entrusted the day-to-day oversight to a nonprofit that sounds like an environmental group: the Texas Habitat Conservation Foundation. What’s not advertised is the occupation of the board members who created it. They are all registered lobbyists for the powerful Texas Oil and Gas Association, also known as TXOGA.
Heckling at hockey games can sometimes verge on offensive, but it’s a crucial part of the atmosphere, writes Morgan Reppert. Anyone who has ever had the pleasure of attending a hockey game—whether it be professional or junior—has learned the unspoken rules of fan etiquette. First and foremost, you should come in your team’s apparel or not at all. Secondly, always throw your hat on the ice when someone scores a hat trick. Lastly, you should keep your heckling creative; no one wants to hear “URI was my safety school” four times.
“Because done right, it’s a parent’s full-time job. It’s really their full-time job, and my dad had a full-time job. And my mom had a full-time job taking care of my dad and four kids,” Howard says. Her work has often brought her in contact with young actors. The ones she expects to survive the tumultuous world of being a young actor – such as her “Pete’s Dragon” co-stars Oona Laurence and Oakes Fegley – are those who have a family structure similar to hers.
EMPORIA - Hutchinson's first defensive and offensive series displayed how Saturday's Class 5A state championship game was going to go. The defense forced three St. Thomas Aquinas incomplete passes and then a punt. The Hutchinson offense marched 68 yards on seven running plays that resulted in a touchdown. That's the formula that Hutchinson has used all season. The Salthawks' offense has run over the opposition with a combination of power runs inside by junior fullback Josh Smith while junior Deveon Dinwiddie, and seniors Shadrach Caudillo and Todd Schultz work the ball around the outside.

Fernando Gaxiola: "The police department understood something very simple: You cannot move a child without parental consent." When Fernando Gaxiola got the call, his otherwise peaceful April morning went white-knuckle. It was a mother, frantic because her baby was being flown to Mexico by University Medical Center. The mother was an undocumented immigrant. But "Baby Mejia," born in Tucson, was an American citizen. Now the woman was seeing her newborn dispatched to a social agency in Sonora--without her consent, she said.
. The percentage is now at its lowest since 1959 when the Boston Red Sox became the last team to become integrated. Seventeen members will be on the committee. This includes Hall of Famer Frank Robinson, Chicago White Sox vice president Kenny Williams and Southern University baseball coach Roger Cador. The presence of African-American players in the MLB has been on a steady decline since it reached its peak of 27 percent in 1975. This season, 7.7 percent of players are Black. Some of the teams have become completely whitewashed with no Black players at all on their rosters.
MAURICIO POCHETTINO pointed praise to Liverpool for their bold decision to splash £70m on Virgil Van Dijk last January is unlikely to be lost on Daniel Levy. Tottenham finished two points ahead of Liverpool in last season’s table but after Jurgen Klopp splashed out a further £165m in the summer, Pochettino’s side travel to Anfield 15 points adrift of their rivals. Lucas Moura, nearly 15 months ago, was the last player of any value Tottenham signed. So it was hard not to imagine there was some sort of hidden message when Pochettino turned out to be such an admirer to Jurgen Klopp’s big-money spending.

Now free from federal custory, Vick can lobby for a return to the field. Former NFL star Michael Vick is a free man after serving his 23-month sentence for bankrolling a dog-fighting operation. But it remains to be seen if the suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback will be able to return to the field. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Vick indefinitely prior to the 2007 season, and has not given any timetable for ruling on Vick's possible reinstatement, according to The Associated Press. It is expected that Vick will soon sit down face-to-face with Goodell, who has said he would review Vick's status after he completed his federal sentence.

What's The Difference Between John Elway And Barbaro? Let's just get to what you probably want to know about me, Brian Hickey, the new weekend guy: How to throw me down into your basement well with Precious because you get rammy when swaddled in vulnerable soullessness on Saturdays and Sundays. 1) Mock John Elway. He is the Way and the Light. If you compare Him to a horse, I will find you and I will cut you. 2) Mock the fact that my wife and I named our first child after a high-school wrestler in an 80s movie.
Generally, investors who own widely-held stocks or mega-cap companies can hope to at least match the market’s performance. But beating the market can often require diving into small-cap stocks — stocks whose companies have market caps of $2 billion or less. These smaller companies just have more room to grow. However, companies of this size can also be high-risk stocks if you consider their higher betas — or the stock’s volatility in relation to the market. Smaller-cap companies have more room to grow, but they can also lose a large percentage of their value much more easily.
The Feed | Restaurant news, dining events and suggested bites from Statesman restaurant critic Matthew Odam. For a city that loves a pint and some craic as much as we do, it’s surprising Austin has such a small number of Irish pubs. All that’s old is new again. And then some. That seems to be the mindset of the hospitality group that has revamped a classic South Austin union hall into a hip boutique hotel. It’s another fake food holiday; I mean, really, #NationalPepperoniPizza day?
Nintendo has announced a launch date for the Wii U, as well as a line-up of games, including New Super Mario Bros U.

The video shows a white man consumed by paranoia over the brown folks in his midst, thinking a tiffin container is a bomb. As much as they make fun of xenophobic sentiment in their music and art, The Kominas deal with the real-world effects of American anti-immigrant racism all the time. When we spoke to them for our “Breaking” series, as they were set to release their fantastic album “Stereotype,” the four-piece rock band (whose members are all Desi) addressed how their ideological stance and American policy criticism put at least one member on a federal watchlist.
Researchers have developed a method for measuring glucose concentrations in saliva, and they say it would be a significant improvement in managing diabetes. The scientists, from Brown University, devised a new biochip sensor that measures blood sugar levels in saliva rather than blood. The daily drawing of blood can be a painful process. The new chip is sensitive enough to detect differences in glucose concentrations that amount to just a few thousand molecules in the sampled volume. The findings were published in the journal Nanophotonics. Researchers made the biochip from a one-inch-square piece of quarts coated with a thin layer of silver.
For some entrepreneurs and high-net-worth individuals, the citizenship with which they were born somewhat restricts their ability to do business or invest globally. As a consequence, the last three decades have seen a growth in savvy high net worth individuals seeking alternative residence and citizenship options. Far removed from traditional ideas of residency and immigration, the era of globalisation has created a new class of ‘citizen.’ Economic citizenship, otherwise called citizenship by investment, is an immigrant investment opportunity. Through economic citizenship programmes, an individual is granted citizenship after completing the legal process of naturalisation and having made a financial investment in a country’s economy.
The nonprofit spin-off of the huge design firm takes on issues like sanitation and clean cook stoves from the unique perspective of the design world. Jocelyn Wyatt and Patrice Martin are the co-leads and executive directors of Ideo.org, the unique nonprofit wing of innovative design firm Ideo.

The Real Housewives of Orange County star Vicki Gunvalson is currently on hiatus between seasons, and she is busy working on her business, COTO Insurance. Because she is the longest-standing housewife in the franchise, she is often a recognizable face. And it sounds like people she meets are actually fans of The Real Housewives of Orange County. Vicki Gunvalson is usually a very private person when she isn’t filming the show. On Twitter, she tends to just send out some random motivational quotes and perhaps a thought once in a while.
A Burton Green scientist has been given a six-figure grant by a cancer charity to fund pioneering research into the causes of the disease. Dr Stephen Royle, based at Warwick University, is set to receive £158,000 from Cancer Research UK to fund pioneering research into how the process of cells dividing in the body can go wrong and cause cancer. Dr Royle and his team will study brain tumour cells in the lab and brain tumour patients’ cells to understand more about the cell division process. He explained that in many types of cancers the cells do not have equal numbers of chromosomes, meaning something has gone wrong during division.

On Feb. 27, former Buncombe County Sheriff’s Lt. John “Johnny” Harrison agreed to a plea deal and confessed to being part of an extortion operation. Harrison is the first of three deputies who served under former Sheriff Bobby Medford to accept a plea bargain, though several Medford allies have signed such deals in the last few weeks. He could face fines of up to $250,000, and up to 20 years in prison for the charge. In his confession, Harrison agrees that he conspired to commit extortion and took bribes from illegal video-poker-machine operators to give them false registrations.

Indonesia prosecutors on Tuesday sought death penalty for an Australian accused of heroin trafficking along with eight compatriots on the resort island of Bali. "We ask that the panel of judges hearing the case of defendant Myuran Sukumaran declare the defendant guilty of the crime of exporting first-class narcotics in an organised way, and without permit," prosecutor David Adji told the district court in Denpasar, Bali's main town. He demanded that the panel of judges "hand down the death sentence to the defendant."

Heard the one about the two "frozen Euro MEPs?" Well, after winning through a long and ruinously expensive election campaign, they found the seats they had won didn't exist after all. The nearest thing to a consolation prize on offer may amount to being put into "cold storage". In simple English, it all means that when, and if ever, the United Kingdom really does depart the European Union, then they may eventually get to the European parliament. Welcome to another sidebar consequence of the rolling Brexit fiasco. But let's quickly explain.

Former colleague and iPhoneDevCamp founder Raven Zachary recently got whacked with a $837.20 iPhone bill for international data usage. Disable international data roaming altogether (it’s a preference in the iPhone, Settings > General > Network > Data Roaming). It should be disabled, by default. Avoid the temptation. As a point of reference, a 20MB email attachment over EDGE or GPRS internationally costs $100 once you go past your 20MB or 50MB allotment. I am told that cost is substantially higher over 3G. Rely upon Wifi, instead of EDGE or 3G service.
CEBU, Philippines - “A buffet of surprises,” was how Eugene Domingo described the sequel to her 2009 smash hit comedy Kimmy Dora: Kambal sa Kiyeme, an independent experiment that altered her course from consistent sidekick to a top-billing star. Three years after that launching film, Eugene reprises the roles of the hilariously dysfunctional identical twins in Kimmy Dora and The Temple of Kiyeme, now showing in theaters nationwide. The sisters Kimmy and Dora Go Dong Hae, both portrayed by Eugene, get into more misadventures via a script still penned by Chris Martinez and executed by director Joyce Bernal.

“Whether you are grabbing a quick lunch or settling in for a fancy dinner, you want to know that the food was prepared in a kitchen that is clean and safe.” That”s how county supervisor Joe Simitian summarized his push for a major countywide system that will eventually rate every one of the 8,000 dining places in the county and later all food trucks and caterers. It will require posting in the front a placard with a red, yellow or green color and also put online the complete results of most recent inspections along with any past violations.
For three years, residents of Virginia Avenue SE have lived the pain of a 24/7 construction zone. An open trench. Fencing stretching a dozen city blocks. Heavy machinery — drilling, digging, dumping and pouring concrete. All in view of their front yards. The work is winding down, with only five months left on the $250 million reconstruction of the old CSX railroad tunnel beneath their street of colorful rowhouses and brick apartment buildings. But residents fear their agony over one of the District’s most contentious construction projects won’t end there.

In a speech at the University of Michigan in 1960, John F. Kennedy challenged US college graduates to volunteer in underprivileged countries for the cause of peace. A year later the Peace Corps was established. Since March 1, 1961, 220,000 Americans have served in one of the most impactful lasting legacies of Irish American President John F. Kennedy: the Peace Corps. Established on this day 18 years ago, the idea for the establishment of the international volunteer organization first came from an impromptu speech by JFK at the University of Michigan in 1960.
A NASA research plane, as part of Operation IceBridge, captured this photo as it flew over a portion of the West Antarctic ice sheet in 2016. Earth-orbiting satellites are watching Antarctica thaw. Eighty scientists from over 40 earth sciences agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency, used satellite data from between 1992 to 2017 to find that Antarctica has lost three trillion tons of ice to the oceans over this 25-year period. Their research, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, confirms a troubling trend, as much of the world's fresh water is frozen away in Antarctica.
Bakersfield went from having no poke restaurants to three in a matter of months! Killer Poke, 24th Street Poke, and Poke Luau are the only three stand-alone poke spots in town, so it was time to battle them out. Jada Montemarano ordered a bowl from all three places. To keep it consistent, she ordered bowls with white rice, spicy tuna, salmon, crab, seaweed salad, avocado and edamame (when offered), topped with spicy mayo and ponzu sauces. Killer Poke and Poke Luau offered avocado and edamame, but 24th Street Poke did not.

She said that when she was a solo mum 24 years ago she did not tell Work and Income about the extra flatmates who were paying rent in her house.
A team of MIT grad students just won a SpaceX-hosted competition to design a pod for the futuristic transportation system. The result is a 550-pound pod made of aluminum, carbon fiber, and polycarbonate. It uses two arrays of 20 neodymium magnets to levitate over the track (rather than air bearings, a common approach that works a bit like an air hockey table), then switches to wheels for the low speeds required to enter and exit a station. Elon Musk's wild Hyperloop has captivated engineers ever since he almost casually mentioned the idea three years ago.

Work continues on the Seventh Street Station elevator tower for the new pedestrian bridge over the Colorado River and Interstate 70. New intersection light signals, Sixth and Laurel roundabout, elevator installation and caisson drilling — there is never a dull moment on the Grand Avenue bridge project. We are on track to complete or have already started major work over the next month to keep us on track for the Aug. 14 bridge closure. The runoff in the Colorado River should be low enough in early July to start building the north causeway for bridge construction.
SAN DIEGO (KGTV) -- Pacific Beach alone relies on over 4,000 hospitality workers, often working overnight hours. Safety concerns while on the job, closing up, or walking home are an unfortunate reality of the industry. “When you’re out there, and it’s dark, and you can’t see any one thing around you, I can’t tell you how vulnerable you feel, because you’re constantly looking around you," said Marian Novak, Director of the Responsible Hospitality Coalition. Novak has worked in Pacific Beach since 1991 and currently does responsible beverage training for servers.

The Massachusetts women’s lacrosse team lost its third straight game to New Hampshire yesterday afternoon, 11-8. The Minutewomen (2-4) came out firing after the opening whistle, scoring two goals within the first three minutes of play. Midfielder Haley Smith knocked in her sixth goal of the season to give UMass an early lead. The UMass lead was short-lived, as the Wildcats (3-0) came right back with its own pair of goals as midfielders Hayley Rausch and Kate Keagins scored. UMass took advantage of having the ball again off a dangerous play by UNH,.
…it’s an English translation—the first, incidentally—of Tolstoy’s first version of W&P, which was published in Russia in 2000. Tolstoy later returned to this “draft” to add philosophical and historical asides that would ultimately double the book’s length and turn it into the rendition readers know today. Were I to read W&P again, I’d probably return to the canonical version (I loved the philosophical asides), rather than read a different version or ‘first draft’ of the novel.
The federal government launched a Web site today that allows organizations to get information about all grant programs through a single, comprehensive site. Grants.gov is intended to make it easier for organizations to learn about and apply for federal grants. Its launch marks an important milestone in President Bush's electronic government initiative, according to government officials. "For the first time, there will be a single governmentwide source for information about grants programs," said Tommy Thompson, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, who unveiled the site for the administration.

The plane at the centre of the mystery. GEORGETOWN, Guyana, Friday September 8, 2017 – There are damning allegations that Guyanese police may have been involved in the discovery of a mysterious Brazilian plane on an illegal airstrip last month. Minister of State Joseph Harmon confirmed that the allegations are being investigated. “There is some information that is available to us which is suggesting a certain level of collusion and that information we take very seriously and it will inform the way in which we deal with the actual deployment of ranks in these areas,” he said.
LIVERPOOL'S record-breaking Champions League victory over Besiktas last month is under suspicion in the match-fixing scandal that has shaken football. It is alleged a flurry of bets were made on a high-scoring encounter before Liverpool ran out 8-0 winners over the Turkish side. Besiktas, who had beaten Liverpool 2-1 a fortnight earlier, conceded six second-half goals to slump to a record defeat in the competition. Liverpool officials have not been contacted by UEFA over the claims and Besiktas chiefs were understood to be “livid” at their team’s humiliation at Anfield.
According to the newest report from IDC, the worldwide smartwatch market experienced a round of growing pains in the third quarter of 2016, resulting in a "year-over-year decline in shipment volumes." To put that in numbers, the sales dropped by 51.6 percent, aka from 5.6 million sold last year in this quarter to 2.7 million this year. It is noted that Apple had the biggest drop - almost 72 percent, although they still maintained their position as the overall leader of the worldwide smartwatch market. Interestingly, the highest growth among the leading companies was Garmin, who has tripled its sales to 600,000 watches in 3Q 2016.
Olmsted Locks and Dam and the Ohio River create a strategic region providing a connection between the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland rivers. According to national inland waterway statistics, more tonnage passes through the region than any other place in America’s inland navigation system. The Corps’ 54th Chief of Engineers and Commanding General, Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite said improving navigation is one of the Corps earliest civil works missions, which dates back to the early 1800s. Great Lakes and Ohio River Division Commander Maj. Gen. Mark Toy stated the nation is suffering from the effects of aging infrastructure.
April 3, 2018 at 10:27a.m. The city’s Design Review Committee declined to vote today on a proposal from the Whistle and Keg for an aluminum patio structure outside the downtown bar. Michael Thomas, who co-owns the business with his brother Joseph, said the Whistle and Keg at 101 W. Federal St. is the only downtown bar/restaurant without an outdoor patio and they wanted to have what the other establishments have. But the committee chose to instead ask Thomas that he install an outdoor patio with a more sturdy material such as wood or wrought iron because the other patios downtown made of aluminum are falling apart.
IAN WRIGHT has changed his mind on Marcus Rashford, claiming the Manchester United ace can challenge Harry Kane for the main striking role if he is taken to Euro 2016. Rashford made Roy Hodgson’s initial 26-man shortlist, although the England manager will trim his final squad to 23. Harry Kane was on target for the Three Lions as they prepared for their trip to the Euros with a 2-1 friendly win over Turkey. Rashford meanwhile picked up an FA Cup winners’ medal at Wembley on Saturday, capping off an extraordinary season for the Red Devils which has seen him score eight goals in 18 appearances.

American Legion Post 245 will hold a memorial service at 3 p.m. on May 27 at Pine Hall Cemetery. Memorial Day weekend comes with plenty of celebration -- good times with families and friends in the backyard or in the community. But of course, it's true purpose is to remember all those who sacrificed their lives in service to the nation. A number of services will be held around the State College area and throughout Centre County to remember those men and women who gave their lives. Following is a partial list of services planned for Memorial Day weekend.
Is This the Best Bank in the Midwest? Let's put regional banks under the magnifying glass to find value. Financial stocks have been taking a beating recently. Banks that usually operate in certain regional areas usually stood out in my earlier examination of smaller banks. Let's use this information to determine which bank might be the best in the Midwest. Most of the banks on my list are based out of Ohio, with many banks serving different areas of the state. However, the “Midwest” in this context covers a large area from Ohio to Minnesota.
Three of the peregrine falcon chicks at Norwich Cathedral have now hatched. A third peregrine falcon chick has hatched on the spire of Norwich Cathedral today. The progress of the young falcon family living on a nesting platform on the city landmark is being watched by many nature enthusiasts via webcam. The third chick hatched at about 2.30pm today and could be seen when the male brought some food in and the female fed the chicks. Leanne Thomas, education manager for the Hawk and Owl Trust which installed the nesting platform, said “This is fantastic news.
ROMULUS, Mich – A large amount of money is missing, 900 million to be exact, and people want answers. If the culprit in question were you or I, we would find ourselves in a lot of hot water, having to answer some pretty tough questions. Unfortunately, when the thief is a CEO, a different set of rules often applies. The person who should be on the “hot seat” is Richard Dugas, Chairman and President of Michigan-based PulteGroup Inc., the nation’s largest homebuilder. In 2010 Pulte Group received $900 million from the Worker Home Ownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009.
Israeli children's favorite TV star 'Yuval HaMebulbal' was the focus of unlikely attention on Wednesday. Israeli children's TV star 'Yuval HaMebulbal' ('Confused Yuval') caused an unlikely uproar on Wednesday when the temporary location of his filming set in the West Bank was mistaken for a new Israeli settler outpost by Palestinian media. Calm was only restored when photos later emerged of the true reason for the "outpost" - the set of a movie featuring 'Yuval HaMebulbal', who is famous for being remarkably confused, among both toddlers and parents alike.
Coastline Community College announced this week a partnership and new scholarship with the Asian & Pacific Islander American Scholarship Fund (APIASF).

It’s been just eight months but Norwich City already feels like home for Onel Hernandez – and his first goals won’t hurt either. The winger dragged the Canaries level twice in the final 10 minutes, as Daniel Farke’s men left Birmingham with an opening Championship draw. That impact had been coming after a productive pre-season – alongside several promising performances in his first four months at Carrow Road. Now the £1.7m January signing from Eintracht Braunschweig is happy with his surroundings – and what could lie ahead over the new season.
I went to check out the Bloedel Conservatory this weekend for their ongoing event, Jewel Box of Lights. John Cooper, the Bloedel staff and the Friends of Bloedel have done an impressive job decorating the conservatory. They have created a Christmas wonderland in a tropical, cozy atmosphere. It's a great way to get out of the cold and rain, which is exactly what I did. I can see Vancouverites adding this to their list of annual family traditions. It is amazing to see how far Bloedel has come this past year and the community and partnerships that have been created.

A Brooklyn man will face two felony charges in court Wednesday after fraudulently returning more than $17,000 in merchandise to Home Depot stores, Nassau police said. Police said that Guery Roy, 40, would, for example, pay for a relatively inexpensive item while hiding expensive merchandise that he would shoplift. Then he would return the pricier merchandise for money back, a police spokesman said. Roy, of New York Avenue, was charged with third-degree grand larceny and first-degree falsifying business records theft in connection with an April 27 case at a Valley Stream Home Depot, police said.
KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- William (Bill) Dean Johnson, president and CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority, announced his retirement from the federal agency today. Johnson, who joined TVA in 2013, will turn 65 in January. He is TVA's second CEO. The TVA Board is actively conducting an internal and external search, which could take a number of months. Johnson will continue as CEO through the period of selection and orientation to transition the new CEO and sustain strong and continuous leadership for TVA and the Valley.

Beirut: The Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah and its political allies won more than half the seats in Lebanon's first parliamentary election in nine years, according to unofficial preliminary results cited by politicians and Lebanese media. The result, if confirmed by the final count, would boost Hezbollah politically, with parties and individuals aligned with the heavily armed group securing a simple majority in parliament in Sunday's election. Hezbollah's powerful position in Lebanon reflects Iran's regional ascendancy in territory stretching through Iraq and Syria to Beirut. It is an enemy of neighbouring Israel and classified as a terrorist group by the United States.
It&apos;s been two years since Red Bull Music Academy&apos;s Bass Camp touched down in Montreal (and we&apos;re still thinking about Beverly-Glenn Copeland&apos;s stunning lecture btw), and now the series will come to Calgary for the first time next month. From March 14 to 17, more than 20 up-and-coming producers, vocalists and beatmakers from across Canada will descend on Studio Bell (home of the National Music Centre) for a jam-packed weekend of inspiration and accelerated music education.
Bus companies have been criticised for making huge pay-outs to shareholders at a time when job seekers are being “locked out” of employment opportunities by “unreliable and unaffordable” public transport. In addition, First Bus West Yorkshire raised the cost of most single, day and week ticket prices last month, and the West Yorkshire Combined Authority has now vowed to raise their concerns about bus services to the Government. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) presented a study to the authority’s transport committee on Friday in which they claim public transport holds back low-income families from achieving a better standard of living.
Realistic Jury Duty Scam: Savvy Tucson health professional falls prey to con artist. A Tucson health professional falls victim to the latest Jury Duty Scam that cost her more than a thousand dollars. She shares her experience so you know what to watch out for. A nationwide scam claims you'll be arrested because you missed jury duty and you'll have to pay right away to escape it. You might think you can spot a gimmick a mile away, but a Tucson businesswoman fell for it -- hook, line and sinker -- last week.
Throughout the 18th and 19th Century, the British and other European settlers would often be enthralled by the spectacular assortment of food and spices from the myriad regions of the Indian subcontinent. The flavors were exciting and the aromas enchanting, unlike anything they had ever tasted before. But to be truly palatable to most British settlers, these centuries-old recipes needed to be ‘reimagined’ with a little bit of good old British flavour fundamentals. This lead to the foundations of what we now know as ‘Anglo-Indian’ cuisine, a hallmark of India’s culture of acceptance and co-existence.
Liked last year&apos;s bonus? Thought it was pretty good but maybe just a slight bit too generous? You&apos;ll love what&apos;s coming your way this year. Citigroup&apos;s bonuses for investment bankers and traders probably will be little changed or drop from last year as the third-largest U.S. lender seeks to reduce costs, according to a person briefed on the policies. Investment bankers could receive payouts that are close to flat compared with 2012, while traders and salespeople could get cuts of 2 percent, said the person, who asked for anonymity to discuss confidential pay plans.
When studying the effect of climate change on biodiversity, it is important to consider the climate near the ground (microclimate) which a plant or an animal actually experiences. Deep shady depressions, dense old forests or places close to water for example are always considerably cooler than their surroundings. “Knowing where cold climate refugia are in the landscape means we can protect these cold spots and help cold-adapted species to survive a warmer climate. Knowing how colder microclimates are generated means we could even create colder spots by wisely managing our forests”, said Caroline Greiser, PhD student at Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences.
(Reuters) - Ahead of fresh high-level trade talks this week, China is not conceding to U.S. demands to ease curbs on technology companies, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing three people briefed on the discussions. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are scheduled to travel to Beijing for talks starting on March 28, the White House said on Saturday. The FT report said Beijing had yet to offer “meaningful concessions” to U.S. requests for China to stop discriminating against foreign cloud computing providers, to reduce limits on overseas data transfers and to relax a requirement for companies to store data locally.
Editor’s note: This is the first in a three-part series on safely handling and delivering produce. Click here to read the second part in the series, which explores the impact of contaminated produce on small-business truckers. The third part of the series, which explores the problems with self-regulation, can be read here. For several months now, OOIDA and members of Congress have been questioning whether the produce industry should be allowed to regulate itself, and while a growers’ representative told Land Line that he understands why truckers are frustrated, he said growers still believe the best approach is a voluntary one.
Google said on Thursday, November 30 that it released a new AIY Vision do-it-yourself kit based on the Raspberry Pi Zero W board. The kit follows Google’s recent AIY Voice Kit for DIY voice recognition, and provides means for your project to include image recognition without the need for a connection to the cloud. That ability stems from the kit’s vision processing unit, which is capable of running local neural network models. According to Google, the kit includes software supporting three separate neural network models. One model can detect people, cats, and dogs while another specializes in faces and their expressions.
What are some solar system formation theories? What is the Sun made of? What is the composition of the solar wind? How does fusion provide solar energy? What is the temperature and the pressure necessary for hydrogen to fuse to helium? Is it possible to control nuclear fusion? Tell me about the lifetime of the Sun, please. Does the location of the Earth's orbit change when the Sun evolves into a Red Giant? Why doesn't the Sun shine in the night time, when we really need it? Who discovered that the Sun was a star?
is alive and well in Petersburg. A non-story has been milked for all its worth (which really isn't much at all). A small mistake was made by an Electoral Board official and immediately corrected, in the presence of a campaign manager, with nothing to make this an important issue. The entire incident was settled amicably within an hour. So, where's the beef? So, the Reform Petersburg Now folks demand the resignations of all members of the Electoral Board? Why? With whom will they be replaced? To my knowledge, the board has not committed heinous crimes of any sort.

Sometimes through a combination of good policies and some good luck, countries may acquire safety margins as insulation from the financial vicissitudes of the global economy. In circumstances that Russia enjoyed for much of the previous decade, the harsh masters in the form of the international capital markets could be largely ignored. Unfortunately, this long period of good fortune is rapidly coming to an end. Starting in 2011, Russia’s margins, on current trends, will be exhausted, and the country will be exposed to similar pressures that are felt by most countries further to the West.
Weatherfield has seen its fair share of drama in its 54 years, but usually its all scripted. That wasn't the case on Coronation Street this week, when an on-set extra fell unconscious and was rushed to hospital in an ambulance. The supporting actor was filming scenes with character Todd Grimshaw (played by Bruno Langley) on Tuesday night before collapsing onto the hard concrete and forcing producers to cease filming. The actor, wore a black jacket over a grey hoodie, played the role of a thug who had been stood talking to Corrie character Todd as part of an attack scene in Manchester city centre.

There&apos;s been a ten percent increase in participation in Wisconsin&apos;s food stamp program in the past year, and a state lawmaker says it&apos;s not just the slumping economy that&apos;s to blame. State Senator Glenn Grothman (R-West Bend) says the state has dropped a work requirement for recipients, and that&apos;s making us a "welfare magnet." Grothman says there&apos;s no problem with keeping people fed, but not requiring recipients to work means some unwanted elements enter the state.

Many working professionals must have envied the recent 25% hike in salary of government staffs. However, it is the time of the year when private sector employees go through tedious performance appraisal, which will soon result in the increment of their salaries. Performance appraisal is often viewed as extra work by many supervisors. As the end of the fiscal year approaches, supervisors are flooded with other official affairs, making them least focused on the appraisal. This results in many biases, which some employees tend to cash in by working late even if they don't have to.
While I would not wish upon anyone what Marites Fortaliza endured last weekend, being trapped in a billionaire employer’s in-home elevator is, in a way, a dark visual metaphor for today’s hyper-capitalistic, deeply stratified world. The New York Times reports that Fortaliza, 53, of Queens, was stuck in an elevator at an Upper East Side townhouse for three days, from Friday evening until Monday morning, while the owners were away. She works for the family of Warren Stephens, a billionaire investor from Arkansas who bought the townhouse for a reported $8 million in 1999.
It appears Charlotte Church and Gavin Henson are facing competition as Wales' most high profile couple after it emerged Neath-born beauty Katherine Jenkins is secretly dating Cardiff hunk Gethin Jones. Sparks flew when the opera star met the Blue Peter presenter on Strictly Come Dancing where she was performing a duet with Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli back in October. Since then they have been on a string of dates, including a recent night out together at a Take That gig. And last week Katherine, 27, quietly slipped into the studio of the ballroom dancing show to watch her handsome new beau take to the floor.
We don’t always slam a company just for taking a new spin on an idea that didn’t fly in the bubble. But if the founders of the new company were part of the old company, and the business model looks a lot like a pyramid scheme, and they are saying publicly that the only reason it didn’t work the first time around was because the market crashed at the wrong time, we’re going to take a very hard look. AGLOCO is all of those things, but it may be a good idea anyway.
Elizabeth Warren torches Big Oil in a signature Elizabeth Warren moment: "We weren't sent here to work for them"
Big Oil would like to export unlimited amounts of crude oil outside of the U.S. to increase their profits, but there is a longstanding ban on crude oil exports standing in the way. What's a Big Oil executive to do? Spend millions to lobby Congress to change the rules, of course. The export ban was originally imposed as a response to the 1973 oil crisis and applies only to crude oil, not refined oil products.

PAINESVILLE, OHIO: A Northeast Ohio man says he didn�t stop when he hit a 28-year-old man in the road because he thought he�d hit a deer. Johnny McKinney says he didn�t see what he hit that night in February in Madison County, northeast of Cleveland. Turned out it was a man named Joseph Gersin, who was found later in the road and pronounced dead at a hospital. The Willoughby News-Herald reports that the 46-year-old McKinney pleaded guilty Monday to a felony charge of failure to stop after an accident, and misdemeanor driving under a financial responsibility license suspension.

The Captain, Wimbledon’s resident tipster, has been studying the form of each of the finalists.
Roger Harvey has done some serious touring considering he doesn’t have a full-length album under his belt. Over the past year Harvey has opened for the likes of Against Me! and The Menzingers, all without a record backing him up. That will all change on October 9, when Black Numbers will release his solo debut, Twelve Houses. The A.V. Club is premiering one of the songs from Twelve Houses, “Arrow/Plane.” The track plays like a long-lost Neutral Milk Hotel song, but with Harvey’s voice subbing in for the warbly Jeff Mangum.
Monk has arrived at the summit of serious recognition he deserved all along, and his name is spoken with the quiet reverence that jazz itself has come to demand. His music is discussed in composition courses at Juilliard, sophisticates find in it affinities with Webern, and French Critic Andre Hodeir hails him as the first jazzman to have “a feeling for specifically modern esthetic values.” The complexity jazz has lately acquired has always been present in Monk’s music, and there is hardly a jazz musician playing who is not in some way indebted to him.
(SALEM) - This world we live in is changing fast. The so-called good guys eliminate more human life and do more harm to the planet than we can even begin to understand. The fuel for war and earth pillaging is the media and press. As long as they are under control, the evil forces in the world prosper. After ten years, Salem-News.com is perfectly free from this type of corruption. That's pretty damned cool. Tim King launched Salem-News.com ten years ago this year, while he was still working as a Salem-based photojournalist/reporter for KATU Channel 2 News.

During the commentary in-between bouts of competition, check out these books, articles and papers from Brookings on Russia, its economy and politics, relations with neighbors and the world, and Vladimir Putin himself. More research on Russia here and also from the Center on the United States and Europe. To punish Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine for their efforts to deepen relations with the European Union, Putin’s Russia could resort to trade sanctions, gas cut-offs and other pressures, say Fiona Hill and Steven Pifer.
The Young and the Restless (Y&R) spoilers for Wednesday, August 2, tease that Lily (Christel Khalil) will get updates on the rest of Cane’s (Daniel Goddard) awful actions. Once she learns Cane tanked the commercial by targeting Billy (Jason Thompson), Lily will urge him to tell her that’s not true. When he can’t, Lily will make a bold declaration. She’ll insist that she wants Cane out of the house tonight. A crushed Cane will argue that Lily doesn’t mean that.

SHOWERS and clouds didn't stop this year's Newton Show attracting a record number of visitors. More than 5,000 people flocked to the event on Saturday - with several residents even climbing out and sitting on their rooftop to watch two army attack helicopters land in the show's Mesnes Park venue. And as these pictures taken by Newton-le-Willows' Mac Photography www.macphotos.co.uk show it was a huge event. It was the 40th anniversary of the community attraction - which began in 1959 but has been reinstated in recent years due to demand. Newton-le-Willows councillor Seve Gomez-Aspron, chairman of the show's organising committee, said: "It was brilliant.
In the Negev Desert town of Sderot, Israel, Qassam rockets struck just a few hundred yards from the UN’s chief human rights representative during her visit. Having just arrived from a visit to Beit Hanun in Gaza, where she loudly and roundly condemned Israeli attacks, her car was met by angry Israelis as it made its way to the nearby site of the rocket strikes. In the Qassam attack, one Israeli was critically injured with shrapnel wounds to the head and a second rocket started a fire at a factory. The evacuated workers were outside as the UN representative’s motorcade pulled up to observe.

Are Democrats Creating Sympathy for Donald Trump? I’ve been wondering whether a backlash would develop against the Democrats’ crazed, ceaseless attacks on President Trump. No one has ever seen anything like it: the ridiculous smears, the nightly barrage of television “comedy,” over-the-top attacks by former government officials like John Brennan and James Comey, endless investigations into nothing in particular, calls for impeachment (grounds? who needs grounds? ), absurd accusations of “treason,” and so on. It is unprecedented in American history, and maybe voters are starting to think the Democrats have gone too far.
When it was time for Joe Lupinacci to graduate from his high school in Stamford, Connecticut, he knew he wanted to go to college. While other students were deciding which college to apply to, the choice required more thought and research on Lupinacci and his parents’ part. Lupinacci, who has Down Syndrome, needed a college that would meet his needs. Eighty percent of the world’s disabled live in developing nations, according to a report by the United Nations. Their identities, lives and stories are of course varied – but what isn’t is the stigma and lack of resources they face.
Northeastern International Airways suspended service on all but one of its routes after an unsuccessful attempt to attract passengers with new cut-rate fares. The airline, which filed for bankruptcy Tuesday, suspended ''until further notice'' flights to Chicago, Philadelphia and Orlando, St. Petersburg and West Palm Beach, Fla., a spokesman said. It is continuing flights between Islip, N.Y., and Ft. Lauderdale. A Northeastern flight from Chicago to Florida was canceled Wednesday because of mechanical problems. The privately held Ft. Lauderdale-based airline owes some $15 million to creditors.
The co-hosts of the 2014 ACM Awards will square off in this Round 2 matchup to decide country music's hottest male artist. March Man-Ness featured 32 artists, but just 16 remain -- including Luke Bryan and Blake Shelton. Bryan got here by way of topping Billy Currington in Round 1. His fans jumped out to vote early, and the reigning ACM Entertainer of the Year took almost 80 percent of the total. Shelton topped Keith Urban to get here. That matchup wasn't very close, either. The singer and coach on 'The Voice' took nearly 60 percent of the vote.
Alarming figures have identified a Leyland underpass as a crime and anti-social behaviour horror hotspot. A shocking 500-plus incidents at the area have been recorded by police in just the last five years. In the last year alone there have been 167. Now the question is being asked - is this the worst crime and anti-social blackspot in the whole of Lancashire - if not beyond? The blackspot is the M6 underpass on Moss Lane at Farington Moss. It has already been described as a “subway from hell”. In January, a man in his 50s was knocked unconscious, stamped on and left on the ground while walking home.
NATIONAL Trust places across Herefordshire are set to undergo vital conservation works this winter. The charity carries out work throughout the year, but January proves to be the busiest time, with a host of projects to preserve and protect already well underway in the county. At Berrington Hall, near Leominster, work is currently taking place to conserve an original Court Mantua dress which belonged to Ann Bangham, wife of Berrington's first owner, Thomas Harley, in the 18th century. Delicate fragments made of silk and woven with gold thread were recovered in 2016.
Back in the ’70s, I used to expect the government to suffer a financial collapse at which time it would have to quit doing most of the things it’s doing because it would run out of money. That isn’t what has happened. Instead of cutting spending it has printed more money and tried to increase taxes on various things. Like many things historical, there’s a precedent for this. There’s a proverbial saying that “Rome wasn’t built in a day,” but it didn’t collapse in a day either.
On Nov. 27, 2018, deputies with the Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office Drug Enforcement Unit (DEU) served four search warrants to investigate illegal cannabis cultivation on the 4100 block of Wilder Ridge Road, east of Honeydew. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife assisted in the service of the warrant. The parcels investigated did not possess the required county permit and state license to cultivate cannabis commercially. During the service of the warrants, deputies located a sophisticated cannabis cultivation operation, including processing buildings, living quarters and multiple light deprivation greenhouses that appeared to have been recently harvested.
Women charged in Phnom Penh Municipal Court with trafficking 400 grams of methamphetamine yesterday told a judge they were users, not dealers. Three Vietnamese nationals Nguyen Thikuk, 45; Nguyen Thikav, 33; and Tung Thimitak, 26, were arrested in a June 11 police raid of a rental house in Russey Keo district, said Phnom Penh Municipal judge Sous Sam Ath. In addition to the nine packets of methamphetamine that collectively weighed out to 400 grams, police also confiscated “a drug scale and other related materials”, Sam Ath said.
Predicting the future is dangerous work. Predicting the future is dangerous work. Where are all those flying cars and housekeeping robots we were promised back when we were in grade school? Looking ahead even ten years in the future is risky. Need proof? Think back to 1993. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone predicting back then that e-mail would surpass the phone as the business communications medium of choice. The authors of It's Alive—Meyer, the former director of the CGE&Y Center for Business Innovation, and Davis, a consultant—readily concede that the future may not unfold exactly as they envisage.
British Prime Minister Theresa May says her Conservative government plans to scrap years of cost-cutting austerity policies introduced after the 2008 global financial crisis. She told the Conservative Party conference on Wednesday that next year, after Britain leaves the European Union in March, “we will set out our approach for the future,” with spending on public services going up. British Prime Minister Theresa May says divorce negotiations with the European Union are entering the “toughest phase” as she urged her divided Conservative Party to stop bickering over Brexit and back her plan for a future trade deal.
WASHINGTON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Saturday approved a sweeping tax overhaul, moving Republicans and President Donald Trump a major step closer to their goal of slashing taxes for businesses and the rich while offering everyday Americans a mixed bag of changes. In what would be the largest U.S. tax overhaul since the 1980s, Republicans want to add $1.4 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt to finance changes that they say would further boost an already growing economy. U.S. stock markets have rallied for months in hopes Washington would provide significant tax cuts for corporations.
A global cover vote will decide the FIFA 17 cover athlete. image provided by EA Sports. A few weeks ago, EA Sports released images of four players directly marketed as the primary athletes associated with FIFA 17. They are: James Rodriguez of Real Madrid C.F., Anthony Martial of Manchester United, Eden Hazard of Chelsea FC and Marco Reus of Borussia Dortmund. We thought the foursome were going to share the official cover for FIFA 17. As it turns out, those four stars will be in competition to become the game's singular cover athlete.
Gambia executed nine death row prisoners overnight Thursday and more will take place in the coming days, Amnesty International warned Friday. President Yahya Jammeh (pictured) vowed last week to carry out all death sentences by mid-September. AFP - Amnesty International on Friday said that Gambia had executed nine death row prisoners, after President Yahya Jammeh vowed to carry out all death sentences by mid-September. "Amnesty International has received credible reports that nine persons were executed last night (Thursday) in Gambia and that more persons are under threat of imminent executions today and in the coming days," the rights body said in a statement.
I’m not observant enough to have spotted this. Apparently, Apple’s product images for both the iPhone and iPad always feature the device displaying the time at 9:41. After catching a Business Insider video, and then checking out other posts from as far back as 2014, it checks out — Apple is enamored with timeliness. The time actually used to be 9:42. Steve Jobs announced the first iPhone in 2007. The announcement time happened to be 9:42 AM, which led to a host of subsequent product shots featuring that time.
General Hospital (GH) spoilers update for Tuesday, June 26, tease that Carly (Laura Wright) will feel like her world’s crashing down again. Mary Pat (Patricia Bethune) threw Jason (Steve Burton) out of Ferncliff, so she’ll gloat to Carly and make her even more miserable than before. Thankfully, another source of support’s coming. Sonny (Maurice Benard) will arrive for a visit and he won’t let anyone turn him away. Once Sonny sets Mary Pat straight, he’ll approach Carly and try to help her cope.
In recent years, the La Jolla Cove beach and waters have become a hotbed of community contention due to problems stemming from the burgeoning sea lion population there. La Jollans have sat through dozens of committee hearings, four “Crisis at The Cove” Town Council forums, and plowed through a 91-page City report on how to best handle the health and safety issues the sea lions have caused. But through it all, La Jolla Cove Swim Club members continued to peacefully come together for informal swims, social gatherings, camaraderie and a collective appreciation for open-ocean swimming.
The Scottish Open host course may just be better than the Open Championship site. The Senior British Open course could be auditioning for Wales to finally host an Open. And the Women's British Open site may be the toughest of them all. The par-3 13th at Hoylake. If you love links golf, the next three weeks will delight to no end with plenty of television coverage. Trying to pick a winner out of the four venues is impossible, so instead, just sit back and take in the nuances because when the Ryder Cup returns to Scotland this September, they'll be playing an inland Jack Nicklaus design.
By JOSEPH MURAYA, NAIROBI, Kenya, Jul 26 – Police on Tuesday detained more than 200 Public Service Vehicles in the ongoing crackdown on traffic offenders in Nairobi. During the operation, 983 traffic offences have been detected, with offenders set to appear in court on Wednesday. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has directed all traffic officers to arrest all drivers and touts who are specifically not in uniform as required by law. Passengers have also been asked to only board vehicles that drivers and their touts have adhered to the set traffic requirements.
"The saddest part is that there is a generation of Boston kids walking around today who basically have no high school education, who were condemned to not even mediocre jobs because of one man's decision. These kids couldn't get a decent education because Arthur Garrity took that opportunity away from them. A grand experiment, at the expense of the children of Boston, ultimately failed. But not before blood was shed at South Boston High. We now had black students in the school who were often twenty-one or twenty- two, older than the typical eighteen-year-old South Boston senior.
Pretoria - A crowd of curious Mamelodi residents, east of Pretoria, who had converged along the busy Solomon Mahlangu Drive at an accident scene sprinted for cover as live bullets rang out following a confrontation between taxi drivers and some community members. A scholar transport vehicle, delivering Tshwane District Hospital spokesperson Zandile Mthimunye's children home from school had earlier been hit by a Toyota Quantum minibus along the busy Solomon Mahlangu Drive. Some angry community members, the scholar transport driver and the taxi driver were engaged in a heated argument following the accident. Police were not on the scene.
Petroleum minister Arjuna Ranatunga said the government was working to resolve the crisis, which came weeks after authorities turned away a shipment of about 40,000 tonnes of gasoline saying it was contaminated. Colombo: A Sri Lankan minister was forced Monday to apologise for a fuel shortage that has seen long queues form at gas stations and forced many commuters to leave their cars at home. "I apologise to consumers for this inconvenience, but we rejected the last shipment because we didn't want to give substandard product to our motorists," the minister told reporters.
Rain on your wedding day is said to be good luck, but how much does the trick? Danya Skolkin and Josh Tillis didn’t pause to consider the ratio of precipitation to luck when skies turned ominous in the days just before their wedding last fall. But on Aug. 25, as Ms. Skolkin and Mr. Tillis were finalizing the details of their Sept. 3 wedding in downtown Houston, Hurricane Harvey made landfall, ripping into that city and reaching its peak just before the college sweethearts and their more than 300 guests were about to celebrate. At first they crossed their fingers, hoping the wedding would go on.
The Calgary region lost another 1,500 jobs in August as the local unemployment rate held steady at 6.6 per cent, Statistics Canada reported Friday. Employment on a year-over-year basis increased 2.2 per cent, or 17,500 jobs, in the region. Alberta’s unemployment rate remained at six per cent as the province added 4,700 jobs in August. The new jobs — a 0.2 per cent gain from July, and 1.8 per cent more than August 2014 — reflected an increase in full-time employment. Full-time positions were up 8,200, while part-time employment shrank by 3,500 positions.
I pride myself on being a light packer. But unless I'm traveling by car, no matter how little I bring on vacation, I wind up wishing I had packed less. By the time I have wheeled my roll aboard through airport security and to the gate, it feels like I am hauling a steamer trunk. Starting two years ago on a trip to Tibet, I substantially lightened my load by leaving my laptop at home and relying on what was then a newly-acquired Apple iPad as my sole means of staying connected (see "A Financial Advice Wonk Falls For The iPad").
The Denzel Washington-led sequel narrowly took down Mama Mia! 2 for the number one spot at this weekend's box office. Denzel Washington's The Equalizer 2 and Mama Mia! Here We Go Again arrive in theaters this weekend. Denzel Washington takes things to a new level in the new Equalizer 2 trailer. Denzel Washington returns as Robert McCall in the first trailer for The Equalizer 2, in theaters this summer. A new poster and some first look images at Denzel Washington's The Equalizer 2 have arrived in advance of the first trailer.
The former NCI Inc. controller who embezzled around $19.4 million from the company was sentenced Friday to six-and-a-half years in prison. Jon Frank will also have to pay the full amount back in restitution, the Justice Department said Friday. Frank pled guilty on federal wire fraud charges in June and admitted he transferred the funds from NCI’s bank account to his personal accounts over 10 years. Frank created false documents to make the funds appear as reimbursements to another company that administered NCI’s health insurance plan. He spent the stolen money on automobiles and real estate, DOJ said.
"It is our mission to increase awareness and educate the general public on mental health issues," said Floyd Godfrey, Executive Director for the Foundation. "By getting the word out early in the year, we hope to support the communities we live in, by helping individuals and families; as well as reducing the stigma and misunderstandings surrounding mental health issues." MESA, Ariz., Jan. 12, 2015 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) — On Saturday, February 7, 2015, the doors will open at the San Tan Charter School in Gilbert, Arizona, for the first “Healthy Minds-Lives-Communities” event.
Laura Silsby, the leader of 10 U.S. Baptist missionaries facing kidnapping charges in Haiti, is no stranger to legal and financial troubles. The 40-year-old Idaho businesswoman convinced members of Idaho's Central Valley Baptist Church to follow her dream of building an orphanage in the Dominican Republic for Haitian children. But her other business and personal ventures reveal a checkered history. Silsby has faced 14 legal complaints for unpaid wages in connection with her online shopping business, Personal Shopper. Employees won nine of those complaints and Silsby was ordered to pay $31,000 in wages plus another $4,000 in fines, according to the New York Times.
Apple has found a way to get rid of its old iPhones -- sell them to India and other emerging markets. The iPhone 4, which debuted in 2010 in the United States, gives Indians the cachet of Apple but at cheaper prices. “You flaunt an iPhone, but you don’t flaunt an Android,” Punit Mathur, a 42-year-old vice president of a digital media company who switched to a new iPhone 4s from a Nexus 4, told Bloomberg News. The iPhone 5s is too much at $874, but the iPhone 4 is "still an upgrade."
That is the United States’ top “diplomat” saying that a democratically elected head of sovereign state, Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro, must leave office or “we” – the U.S. government that is – will reserve the right to remove him (absurdly described as “return[ing]” the Venezuelan government “back to their constitution.”) It is a declaration of the United States’ presumed entitlement to conduct internationally criminal regime change, confident that it is exempt from global sanction or prosecution. Because we own the world and what we say goes – especially in our hemisphere.
Syracuse Tenants United held a march, rally and press conference June 1 to announce that a group of Syracuse Quality Living tenants will continue their rent strike into June. The SQL is a major landlord in the Syracuse University area. The 10 SQL tenants withholding rent have experienced infestation, mold, lack of heat in the winter and maintenance personnel entering their apartments without notice. Tenants marched to the company office and read prepared statements to the press and supporters. An SQL employee called police on the lawful gathering, and three police cars arrived shortly after.
Manuel Balce Ceneta/The Associated Press<br>A crowd outside the White House in Washington cheer Sunday night upon hearing the news that terrorist leader Osama bin Laden is dead. Originally Published: May 1, 2011 7:57 p.m.
WASHINGTON - Osama bin Laden, the glowering mastermind behind the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks that murdered thousands of Americans, was killed in an operation led by the United States, President Barack Obama said Sunday. A small team of Americans killed bin Laden in a firefight Sunday at a compound in Pakistan, the president said in a dramatic late-night statement at the White House.

A Crowe is flying… over to CBS. Damon Herriman (aka Justified‘s endearingly dim Dewey) will recur on CBS’ upcoming drama series Battle Creek, from exec producers Vince Gilligan (Breaking Bad) and David Shore (House) and starring Dean Winters (Law & Order: SVU). Per The Hollywood Reporter, the actor will play Detective Niblet, a nice guy and cop who looks up to Kal Penn’s Detective Funkhauser and embraces his style. • Orphan Black‘s neurotic soccer mom is confessing her sins!
The U.S. House narrowly rejected on Thursday an amendment that would have barred transgender service members from being eligible for transition-related health care, including gender reassignment surgery. The measure, which would have barred the Defense Department from expending funds on transition-related care, was introduced by Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) as part of the fiscal year 2018 defense authorization bill, but rejected on a 214-209 vote. After Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), who presided over the vote, called out the tally, Democrats in the House chamber applauded in victory.
Just three months after deliver, French First Lady Carla Bruni has regained her slender pre-pregnancy figure. The 44-year-old seemed refreshed and relaxed as she was pictured with her husband Nicolas Sarkozy at Elysee Palace in Paris on Thursday to greet Ivory Coast's First Lady. The new mother held hands with her President husband as they went to greet the Ivory Coast First Lady, the Daily Mail reported. The former model looked elegant but casual in black trousers and top - teamed with a purple coat. Last month, Carla was clicked at the palace's annual Christmas party looking more drained, as any new mother would be.

A New York woman whose daughter was killed by MS-13 gang members has been struck and killed by a car at her daughter's memorial. NEW YORK — A grieving New York mother recognized by President Donald Trump at the State of the Union in his campaign against deadly MS-13 gang violence was struck by an SUV and killed at her slain daughter's memorial site Friday after a heated confrontation with the driver. Evelyn Rodriguez was hit around 4 p.m. in Brentwood, near where her 16-year-old daughter Kayla Cuevas' body was found beaten and slashed two years ago to the day, police said.
Manny Machado is going full Manny Machado for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the postseason, and as is often the case, the bad is getting more attention than the good. The 26-year-old infielder, who the Orioles traded to the Dodgers on July 18, had a pair of home runs and a double to account for all three of his hits and drive in six crucial runs in Los Angeles’ National League Division Series win over the Atlanta Braves. He's followed that up by tying for the team lead with five hits, including a home run and double, in the NL Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers.
Justice Loya's paternal uncle, Mr Srinivas Loya, said he was aware that Justice Loya faced immense pressure while hearing the Sohrabuddin trial. The village of Gategaon, in Maharashtra's Latur district, is the ancestral home of Justice BH Loya, who was hearing the Sohrabuddin trial, in which BJP President Amit Shah was the main accused. Here, we are told that most close members of the family - his father, sisters - have gone to Pune, for the wedding of Justice Loya's daughter. Those that remain are reluctant to speak since The Caravan story broke.
Why do our leaders still fail in their constitutional mandate to deliver honest “public service”? We’ve had a moral-spiritual decline since 1972, which has resulted in our current lack of justice, because of the “selective justice” that our elite leaders rely on. This is also how we lost our spirituality — because of the gargantuan graft and corruption that Marcos initiated. Isn’t the continuing injustice in our midst a constitutional violation of the Filipinos’ human rights? Our current president started his campaign of extrajudicial killings from the time he assumed office.
These are the times when you find out who you are as a team. We have hit a bit of a cold patch and have stumbled through our last couple of games. This, however, does not mean we are going to roll up into a ball and let our competition walk all over us for the rest of the year. Our club has the ability to do great things this season; we just haven't proven it yet. One way to defend our 2-4 record is to say that we have played four state-ranked opponents so far this season, two of them gracing the top five in their divisions.
Which fake movie companies would make the best employers? Movie characters are a lot like real people in many respects. They have hopes and dreams, and they have problems of their own, only their problems tend to be much more dramatic and interesting. Most movie characters are also tasked with making a living so that they can support themselves in their little fictional worlds. Fake groceries aren’t free, and that fake mortgage doesn’t pay itself. So characters have to venture out into the phony “real world” and find imaginary jobs at wholly invented companies.
A grieving family is demanding answers after Richmond police shot and killed an unarmed man. Marcus-David L. Peters, who police say danced naked on the interstate and charged a police officer, has been identified as a science teacher and an honor graduate from Virginia Commonwealth University. The 24-year-old educator’s life was reportedly cut short after a bizarre interaction with police. According to reports, Peters crashed into two vehicles on and then emerged from his vehicle naked and started dancing, rolling around and then running onto an on-ramp. Police said they used a taser to try to subdue Peters after they claim he charged an officer.
Remembering the 2000 Berlin Jews saved by German women. Seventy-five years ago, in February and March 1943, hundreds of women rescued 2,000 Jews, their husbands, from the jaws of death with a daring protest on Berlin’s Rosenstrasse. The Gestapo’s massive “de-Judaization of the Reich territory” that began on February 27, 1943, had imprisoned nearly 2,000 intermarried Jews to a pre-transportation facility at Rosenstrasse, as part of the final roundup of Berlin Jews. For Jews and gentiles married to Jews, mundane customs became tests of strength through an ever-growing web of prohibitions and punishments.
One of the best things about social media account hacking? Plausible deniability. In the age of the Donald, there have been several instances of Twitter being used in the US as a platform for “goin’ rogue,” as the Sarah Palin-originated saying goes. The most high profile example is the National Park Service, which started pointedly and clinically tweeting out climate change science facts once Pres. Cheeto took office and deleted climate change from the White House website’s list of issues. It was quickly slapped with a directive to knock it off, but several individual parks throughout the US then took up the cause.
Clone it? Sure. Beat it? Maybe. Why not build your own AWS? This article belies an almost total ignorance of the breadth of services that AWS provides. Has the author actually used it in anger or is this article based entirely on reading a couple of announcements? "Is it true, then, that anything AWS can do, I can do better? No. Yes, there may be a handful of things that are trickier, more expensive or a bit more involved than keeping things internal, but the benefits will generally be worth the effort and cost."
The British photographer John Stewart is still active at the age of nearly 95. His extraordinary life has seen Japanese PoW camps, encounters with Picasso and Matisse, and a long stint shooting the fashion and business elite of New York. He's also won acclaim as one of the finest practitioners of the still life. Hugh Schofield met John Stewart at his home in southern France. There are not many people who can recall walking along Avenue Foch in 1930s Paris, wearing badge lapels of the right-wing leagues that proliferated in those tense political times.
GOING BY the record of the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) alone, out of the P9.6 billion coconut levy funds collected from 1973 to 1982, PCA funneled more than 50 percent to the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) for the latter’s establishment and disposition. A breakdown of how this was done (see Table 1 on Page A8) does not, however, reveal the juggling of the various coconut levy funds. Ten million pesos apiece was invested in 10 Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) copra trading companies (CTCs).
Pitbull Featuring Ne-Yo, Afrojack &amp; Nayer, "Give Me Everything"
Pitbull's long list of successful collaborations just keeps growing: Following his last hit, "Hey Baby (Drop It to the Floor)," featuring T-Pain, the rapper plots his way back to the top of the charts alongside Ne-Yo, Afrojack and Nayer on new single "Give Me Everything." Ne-Yo delivers the catchy melodic hooks, while Nayer's voice blends in unison with the lead synth line during the pre-chorus. Her soothing voice creates the impression of being suspended in the air before landing with the chorus' stomping beat.
SUMMIT COUNTY – Forget El Nino. Who needs La Nina? Without any obvious large-scale patterns influencing the weather, Colorado seems to have returned to a normal winter storm pattern, with wave after wave of Pacific moisture rolling onshore and delivering a steady series of dumps across the Northern Rockies. “The westerlies across the Pacific are strong now and are driving repeated storms into the western mountains. It has not, however, been far enough south to produce snow and rain for the southwest USA, including southwest Colorado,” said state climatologist Dr. Roger Pielke.
A ComScore Networks study estimated that nearly 80% of all online purchases start at a major search engine. Search engines like Google, Yahoo and MSN can help to bring visitors to your site, but that is only the first step; once visitors arrive on your landing page, the site must keep the momentum going and ultimately convert the visitor to a customer. Landing page targeting and testing -- or a combination of both -- enables you to optimize how your site speaks to your visitors. The core of any Web marketing campaign is the ability to serve landing pages with content that is relevant to its visitors.

Don't look now, but the U.S. economy is slowing again. And that could spell trouble not only for the stock market but for the job market as well. On Thursday, durable goods orders fell 2.8 percent month-over-month and core orders fell 1.8 percent, much worse than expectations for a 0.5 percent decline. At least initial weekly jobless claims came in at 265,000, below the consensus estimate and marking the 55th consecutive streak below 300,000 -- the longest since 1973. Still, the durable goods data led the Atlanta Fed to downgrade its first-quarter GDPNow forecast to just 1.4 percent from 1.9 percent previously (chart below).
A number of items have been stolen in the burglary including Concorde memorabilia, Concorde cufflinks and Concorde related items. Two men smashed the front windows, escaping with a 'handful' of watches. The shop's Managing Director Damon Barker says he feels 'violated'. A burglar responsible for more than fifty break-ins across Surrey has been jailed for four years. Paul Begley, who's 38 years old and from Kent, was responsible for fifty three burglaries in Surrey. The feedback from the victims, especially those from several years ago has been overwhelmingly positive.
Captain Richard Phillips was held hostage on this lifeboat after pirates hijacked the Maersk Alabama in April 2009. (CNN) -- Pirates targeted the Maersk Alabama, the ship seized in a dramatic operation in the Indian Ocean waters two years ago. Four suspected pirates approached the ship in a skiff and a hook ladder, the Maersk said in a statement Tuesday. "The captain followed the appropriate protocol and authorized an embarked security team to fire warning shots in order for the pirates to turn away," the statement said. Shortly after, the boat took off and the ship was headed to the Kenyan coastal town of Mombasa.

If you tuned out the fourth quarter of the biggest blowout win by the Giants in four years, then you might have missed the entire body of work for rookie Kyle Lauletta. The Giants demoted and deactivated their rookie quarterback to No. 3 on the depth chart and activated veteran Alex Tanney against his former team Sunday as the Titans visited rainy MetLife Stadium. Eli Manning and Tanney had been the Giants' top two quarterbacks for the first 11 games before the Giants flip-flopped Lauletta and Tanney two games ago. Lauletta did not play against the Bears but made his NFL debut with a 40-0 fourth-quarter lead against the Redskins.

Serial Gurbani has already caught headlines for its tittle. Sikh community has been protesting it and so the channel has decided to call for a name change.The new title for the show is now 'Bani'. Official statement from channel Colors stated-Channel Colors has tremendous respect for all communities including the Sikh community and we would never do anything to hurt or disrespect the sentiments or religious feelings of any community. In fact the producer of the show is a Sikh herself and even has a niece named Gurbani. Being from the Sikh community she has tremendous respect for her own religion.
HTC’s rumored 5-inch smartphone could be more than just HTC’s shot at the Galaxy Note II, it could be the first phablet Nexus device. According to GSM Arena, the 5-inch HTC smartphone could come to market as the Google Nexus 5. Previous rumors said the phone will come to market as the HTC One X 5 or come to Verizon Wireless as the HTC Droid Incredible X. We haven’t heard of any of these improvements before, but it does make sense for Google to release a Nexus phone with a new version of Jelly Bean instead of the version currently available on the Galaxy Nexus.
Over the last few years Denmark has lost its stranglehold on being labelled the happiest country in the world – with first Finland and then also Norway sneaking ahead over the past two years. But the Danes have stymied the haemorrhaging and are back up to second in UN’s latest 2019 World Happiness report (here in English). The Finns remain just ahead, however. “The annual data for Finland have continued their modest but steady upward trend since 2014, so that dropping 2015 and adding 2018 boosts the average score, thereby putting Finland significantly ahead of other countries in the top ten,” the report found.
Los Angeles is to ban e-cigarette use in public places where tobacco smoking is prohibited, including work places, restaurants and bars, following a vote Tuesday. The LA City Council voted by 14-0 to outlaw their use in indoor workplaces, outdoor dining areas, parks, recreational areas, beaches, bars and nightclubs where lighting up is banned. So called "vaping" lounges and stores will be exempted, in line with exceptions made for cigar and hookah lounges where tobacco smoking is allowed, as will using e-cigarettes for "theatrical purposes."
Nasa's Cassini probe has found that the dunes on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan vary in shape just like dunes on Earth - and even look similar to deserts on our planet. The similarities end there, of course - not only are the dunes on Titan 300 feet high and up to a mile wide, they're made of frozen hydrocarbons - chemicals found in crude oil - rather than sand. There are four million square miles of dunes on Titan, an area the size of the United States. Their formations could be key to understanding the clouded moon's mysterious weather patterns.
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ant Financial Services Group, operator of China’s biggest online payment platform by market share, Alipay, has closed its latest funding round having raised $10 billion from a clutch of global and local investors, five people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Ant’s first fundraising targeting global money values the firm at $150 billion, the people said, compared with about $60 billion after its previous fundraising in April 2016. A number of global sovereign wealth funds and private equity firms joined the fundraising as main investors.

ROCKFORD, Ill (WIFR) --- A tribute was held at Mercyhealth Sportscore Two to honor the legacy of Webbs Norman. Norman was the Rockford Park District Executive Director for 34 years. Norman planned his memorial service in advanced and referred to is as his life "graduation". "Just like a graduation from high school or college, he left earth, he's graduated to heaven. That was his way and he always called it his graduation for the last 25 years," said John Cook, Norman's longtime friend.
South Korean Lee Mi-rim has picked up her third career LPGA Tour title in California. Lee cruised to a six-shot victory at Kia Classic at par-72 Aviara Golf Club in Carlsbad, California, on Sunday (local time). She began the final round nursing a one-stroke lead over fellow South Korean Hur Mi-jung at 13-under, but poured in five birdies on the front nine in the final round to pull away from the pack. Lee carded a bogey-free round of seven-under 65 on Sunday for the four-day total of 20-under 268, and cashed in $270,000.
In a move that appears designed to provoke widespread questions, the anonymous managers of the TrueCrypt open-source encryption project abruptly pulled the plug on the effort without explanation. A mysterious message posted on the project's website on Wednesday warned users of unfixed security errors in TrueCrypt and cautioned them about the software not being secure. The website provided detailed steps for TrueCrypt users to migrate to BitLocker, a commercial encryption tool. BitLocker is also Microsoft's encryption tool that ships with Windows. "This page exists only to help migrate existing data encrypted by TrueCrypt," the website stated.
FUNimation Entertainment announced a record breaking opening night for the theatrical release of Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection of F. The anime film, which opened last night in 894 theaters across the U.S., brought in a stunning $1.97 Million at the box office for FUNimation Films on opening day of the limited theatrical event. The movie's per screen average of more than $2,198 landed it in 1st place yesterday in Average Per Screen among the Top 10 movies showing in the U.S. and 6th place in overall box office gross against all major studio releases.

Kerry's Globe Problem, Part 2. Editor Martin Baron revives suspicions that the Boston Globe dislikes the presumptive Democratic nominee. Still, Chatterbox is not yet willing to take back what he wrote about the Globe. Partly that’s because the Globe long ago established a pattern of endorsing Kerry while simultaneously portraying him unsympathetically. Partly it’s because Chatterbox thinks it’s logical for a presumptive presidential nominee to receive better press after he sews the nomination up but before the general election goes into high gear. Mostly, though, it’s because the Globe itself insists on churning up additional evidence of its distaste.
Nearly seven million Muslims live in the United States today, and their relations with non-Muslims are strained. Many Americans associate Islam with figures such as Osama bin Laden, and they worry about “homegrown terrorists.” To shed light on this increasingly important religious group and counter mutual distrust, renowned scholar Akbar Ahmed conducted the most comprehensive study to date of the American Muslim community. Journey into America explores and documents how Muslims are fitting into U.S. society, placing their experience within the larger context of American identity. This eye-opening book also offers a fresh and insightful perspective on American history and society.
Are SEO Friendly Graphics Worth It? Home > SEO Copywriting > Are SEO Friendly Graphics Worth It? Back in March I introduced you to an old RustyBrick developer who devised SEO Friendly Graphic Buttons. In that blog entry I linked to an article he wrote while with us named Graphical, SEO Friendly Buttons. Basically, it is a how to article on how to dynamically create graphical text with a header tag. We now have a thread at our forums named H1 in a graphic where a member asks questions about if it is allowed and is it beneficial?
The subject of DNA is very much in the headlines and news but very few have bothered to learn or understand just how this amazing molecule works and how it makes us what we are from head to toe. Haven't you ever asked yourself how you got your nose, eyes, ears, fingers, toes, and everything else? How did your DNA bring all this about? Before we answer that question we need to know just a few simple things about DNA. DNA is the abbreviated name for the genetic code and it is exactly that - a code.
The integration of JICMAIL into the IPA TouchPoints Channel Planner is a world first integration of advertising mail (direct mail; door drops and business mail) into a gold standard multi-channel reach and frequency data set, and has revealed how mail occupies an effective frequency sweet spot within multi-media schedules by immediately delivering frequency in the 3 to 5 range and reducing repeat exposure for over-exposed audiences. JICMAIL asked Simon Frazier, Research & Marketing Manager, IPA to elaborate on the value of IPA TouchPoints in today’s complex time-precious world for planners and consumers alike.
Cigna CEO David Cordani Friday said the addition of the pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts is helping bring new choices for the PBM’s customers to medical plans the insurer sells. The addition of Express Scripts allows Cigna “additional capabilities that will offer new choice,” Cordani told analysts on a 75-minute call with analysts to discuss the company’s fourth quarter earnings. He said the insurer is already starting to meet with brokers and consultants about coming new capabilities of the combined company, saying what they are offering is "not a net new concept," but an expansion of choices.
After checking out the final night of the electronic music oriented Recombinant festival a few weeks ago in San Francisco, I mentioned to a friend who had seen the show how impressed I was by the Invisible Scratch Pickles' turntable tricks. Much to my surprise, he thought the DJ group's scratch-centered set was just OK. Our opinions of the Pickles differed so much that I began to feel as if we hadn't gone to the same concert, and in a way we hadn't. The Pickles weren't on a stage, and I was close enough to where they were standing to see every scratch.

Is AI going too far? Artificial Intelligence has come a long way from being fictional to encompassing a wide range of categories from logistics, data mining, playing chess or diagnosing medical conditions, to name a few. Image generation has been one of the areas of research of several companies, and Nvidia’s AI seems to have achieved success in creating scarily realistic looking human faces. Nvidia’s Tero Karras, Samuli Laine and Timo Aila have revealed the progress made by their AI in a new whitepaper.
The United States and Japan still face security of supply concerns for strategic rare earth elements even as prices continue to ease from historic highs reached in 2011. The production and processing for REEs is complex. Included with the usual suspects – grade, tonnage, jurisdiction, and infrastructure – are mineralogy, proprietary metallurgy, and environmental issues that are material to any production scenario. With the completion of the winter 2014 drill program, Commerce Resources Corp. both moves closer to a pre-feasibility study for the Ashram Rare Earth Deposit and looks toward cementing designs for mine development.
One of the myths about prisons is that the prison officers are in control. That isn’t the case, and never was in the 20 years I spent in Britain’s category A jails. It’s a mirage for the public. The peace in prisons is kept by the inmates, who are contained by the officers. There is a big difference. When I first went to jail, the IRA prisoners had respect. They were at the top of the tree. There was an occasion when I was put on the “block” (the segregation unit).
This weekend the Texas Legislature approved HB 2741, a vehicle licensing bill that included a provision to increase penalties on trucks that are hauling overweight loads on our roadways. The House voted 135-9 to approve this measure after differences between House and Senate versions of the bill were ironed out in a conference committee. The Senate approved the measure as well, but the recorded vote is not available as of this publication. All that is missing now for our roadways to become a little bit safer is for Governor Rick Perry to apply his signature.
Germany midfielder Sami Khedira runs the risk of missing next year's World Cup in Brazil after suffering a serious knee injury in Friday's friendly draw with Italy. Khedira came off midway through the second half of the 1-1 draw with the Italians in Milan, and the German Football Federation (DFB) confirmed on Saturday that the 26 year-old had suffered a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. "We hope that he will recover before the 2014 World Cup," the DFB said without confirming exactly how long he will be unavailable.
RICHARD Madeley has revealed that his wife Judy Finnigan wants Britian’s Got Talent’s Donchez Dacres to wear tighter trousers on Sunday's final. The Good Morning Britain presenter, who is standing in for Piers Morgan, joked about his wife’s naughty wishes as he chatted to the talent show finalists and Iain Lee on today’s show. Meanwhile Iain’s open shirt look left those watching at home baffled as they took to Twitter to discuss his state of undress. Singer Donchez won the second semi-final of the talent show earlier this week after getting through on the public vote.
TEMECULA, Calif. /California Newswire/ — Professional Community Management of California, Inc. (PCM) chief executive officer Donny Disbro addressed community association professionals on Friday on the benefits and pitfalls of mediation as an alternative to costly litigation. As part of an expert panel discussion at Community Association Institute's annual Legal Forum, Disbro offered first-hand insights on how association boards can best manage and resolve disputes between HOAs and management companies. "There's no question that mediation is far superior to litigation in resolving disputes between associations and residents," explained Disbro.
Federal Minister for Information left many a religious elements flabbergasted with his May 3 comments on Madrassas. Never has any politician spoken so clearly on this purportedly ‘sensitive’ issue against the religious extremists promoting organized hatred, ignorance and culture of ‘unlearned hordes’ in Pakistan. The Minister’s pluck caused him public criticism by the religious ‘scholars’, decrees of excommunication from Islam and of blasphemy, accusations of being Ahmadi (yes, being Ahmadi is that bad! ), public expressions of hatred through prominently placed banners etc., and a notice to explain himself to the Senate.
The Dayton man booked into the Montgomery County Jail late last month after questions were raised about charitable solicitations made in Lebanon has been released, according to records. Joseph E. Steward, 50, of Dayton, was released from the jail earlier this week after pleading guilty to obstructing official business and possession of drug paraphernalia in Montgomery County Municipal Court, according to court records. Steward was given credit for 17 days he served in the county jail. A $100 fine and 43 days in jail were suspended during a hearing on Tuesday, according to court records.
The author on a hike in Peru during his six-week vacation. I just returned from a six-week vacation to Bolivia and Peru. Since the beginning of October, I’ve been climbing mountains, exploring ancient ruins, and sipping pisco sours. Many folks dream of taking trips like this, but few people make it happen. (Well, except for Australians it seems. In Peru, I met dozens of Australians who had somehow managed to make long-term travel a reality.) If travel is a priority for you, though, it is possible to work it into your budget.
Security researchers have presented proof-of-concept code capable of accessing the database driving a Microsoft ERP system and then diverting funds while avoiding immediate detection. Tom Eston and Brett Kimmel of vendor SecureState presented the would-be malware this week at the Black Hat Abu Dhabi conference. A white paper on the mock attack, called Project Mayhem, is available on the SecureState website. For hackers seeking big money, infiltrating an enterprise resource planning system would be like hitting the jackpot. Once inside, cybercriminals would have access to financial software, as well as applications driving business operations.
Looks like the Punjabi munda is going the Gujju chokda way! Vocalist and rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh has sung a peppy Gujarati song for the first time ever for which producer Sunil Bohra turned lyricist. It was a casual chat between the two that led to the composition of the track. Bohra recalls, “This is also the first time that I have penned a music track. I was in Delhi with Honey when we went to his studio for a jamming secession. In between our conversation, we started talking about the old Gujarati song Achko machko.
Home secretary Alan Johnson has defended his decision not to step into the case of Pentagon hacker Gary McKinnon, who faces extradition to the United States for breaking into US government computers eight years ago. McKinnon, 43, is due to be extradited to Virginia amid allegations that he caused hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of damage to US government computers - but campaigners say he should be tried in the UK. Last week Johnson said he did not have the power to intervene, and today reiterated his reasoning after McKinnon's MP, David Burrowes, tabled an urgent question in parliament.

Find out who'll be missing when the ITV competition returns. Dancing on Ice fans will be missing one of the most popular new additions to the rebooted series when the show returns next year. The ITV reality competition returned earlier this year with a number of format tweaks, including adding Britain's Got Talent brothers Ashley and Jordan Banjo as part of its on-air team. While Ashley is expected to return for the 2019 series as one of the judges, a spokesperson for the show has confirmed to Digital Spy that Jordan has had to quit as DOI's digital host from the backstage rink.
The Facebook Journalism Project will collaborate with news organizations “to develop products, learning from journalists about ways we can be a better partner, and working with publishers and educators on how we can equip people with the knowledge they need to be informed readers in the digital age,” she says. Facebook wants to develop news products that offer “new storytelling formats” and local news. It also will collaborate on new business models, including live ad breaks in videos. The company plans to offer journalists e-learning courses, newsroom briefings, and tools to help them work with Facebook products.
Personalized feed reader my6sense has launched in beta today on Google's Android platform, and can be downloaded freely from the Android Market now. My6sense made some ripples in the vast ocean of iOS apps when it launched last year; because it takes the simple concept of RSS and social feed reader and gives it some "digital intuition" so your feed is more relevant to your interests. The main streams of content in my6sense come from Facebook, Twitter, Google Buzz, and Google Reader, and once you enter all your feeds, you start using the app as you would any other feed reader.
Project Decibel's job postings create an online trail of what the company is working on. The man who nearly changed the way you watch television may be looking to shake up the wireless industry next. Project Decibel is the company behind it all, and it's the brainchild of Chet Kanojia, founder and CEO of the now-defunct Aereo. He's teased a big reveal in New York City on January 27, bringing to light the details behind the stealthy startup. Kanojia, of course, is no stranger to swinging for the fences.
Most of the volunteers were teens. They typically would work in teams of two adults and five students. For the week, they would be part of Appalachia Service Project, a home-repair ministry started in 1969 by a Methodist minister. The project operates 30 centers in Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee, Virginia and North Carolina. For seven weeks this summer, different volunteer groups from across the country will arrive at Magoffin High and the other centers for a week. During the course of a summer, as a different crew arrives each Monday, a house can be transformed.
SHEPHERD -- The Bullock Creek boys came away with a split of two Tri-Valley Conference Central track meets Wednesday as they defeated Shepherd 84-53 and lost to Alma 75-62. The Creek girls lost both meets, 71-65 to Alma and 77-65 to Shepherd. On the boys' side, taking first for Creek were Travis Vennard in the shot put with a toss of 43 feet, 6 inches, James Henderson in the 100 meters (12:02), Trey Griese in the 200 (23.94), and James Sira in the 3200 (10:12.03).
Fernandez was arrested and charged with burglary and criminal mischief. The tumultuous relationship has made headlines before. In late April, Alvarez was charged with battery after an altercation with Fernandez over a cat. Police said he grabbed her, pinned her to the wall, swore and spat on her. Alvarez later pleaded not guilty. The incident thrust Alvarez back into the news after lying low since his time in public office, which ended when his constituents voted to recall him in 2011. At the time, it was considered the largest recall of a mayor in U.S. history.
When families needed a safe place for their seniors, The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills promised to be a caring home away from home – located directly across the street from Hollywood’s Memorial Regional Hospital. But when Hurricane Irma knocked out the power to the nursing home’s air conditioning, authorities say vulnerable residents sweltered in oppressive heat for days and nobody on staff walked across the street to the hospital to make it clear that patients’ lives were endangered. In just 12 hours and 14 minutes on Wednesday, eight of the nursing home’s residents died.
The Walking Dead fans (and Norman Reedus) can breathe a huge sigh of relief if Season 3 Part 2 spoiler alerts are accurate. The cast list released during the final days of 2012 included Reedus’ name, so apparently Daryl survives being cast into The Governor’s one-ring circus alongside his brother Merle Dixon. The IMDb list was specific to The Walking Dead Season 3 episodes 9 and 10, so Daryl Dixon still might not survive the entire season. The fan revolt promised if the redneck hottie meets an untimely demise may play a role in the decision to keep the unexpectedly charismatic character alive.
Rugby legend John Beattie has complained to the police after he was pelted with eggs by a passenger in a car while cycling. Beattie was attacked as he commuted between his BBC Radio Scotland job in central Glasgow to his home in the city. Beattie, who won 25 caps for Scotland during a glittering career, was urged by his followers to call the police. Beattie went back to the spot and discovered that it had been eggs that had been launched at him. The camera then pans to the cracked shells and the insides splatted over the pavement.
Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) and Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) started 2018 with roughly the same valuation, but vastly different sentiments. Both companies started 2018 at around $18 billion in market cap, but a lot has occurred in the social media realm since then. First there was the infamous Kylie Jenner tweet expressing her distaste for Snapchat’s new software update that reportedly wiped out $1.3 billion in market cap. Another public spat, this time with Rihanna, came after the platform ran an insensitive ad in reference to a physical altercation with former beau Chris Brown.
The latest report from Violence Policy Center. I find it ironic and sad that the very day an annual report on violence against women was released, a famed pro athlete was kicked off his team for slugging his wife in the face. By now you’ve probably heard that Ray Rice, the Baltimore Ravens star running back, was caught on camera hitting his then-fiance and knocking her out with the single blow in an elevator . The March incident cost him a two-game suspension, but when TMZ released the video showing the act, the Ravens terminated his contract and the NFL suspended him indefinitely.
He's here. He has compassion for homosexuals. Get used to it. Pope Francis, the most interesting man in the world, has made yet another stride toward enlightening the secular and religious worlds alike. In his recent interview with an Italian newspaper, the pontiff signaled a potential future where Catholics approve of gay rights. When asked if regulating civil unions is a road the Church can understand, the Pope replied, "We have to look at different cases and evaluate them in their variety." Sure, he prefaced this with, "Marriage is between a man and a woman."

No longer limited to calling other Jaxtr users, the service is taking cue from Skype for its revenue strategy. Jaxtr, the dial-around service (see Jaxtr makes click-to-call really simple) that lets you make free calls to those people who have at one point called you via the Jaxtr widget, is launching a new service that lets you bypass the step of first connecting with callers via the Internet. Now you can make "out of network" calls directly from you mobile phone to anyone in the world. These calls aren't free, though.
The startup is unveiling its Netsocket Virtual Network suite, the latest portfolio of products to hit the increasingly crowded SDN space. Netsocket, a 6-year-old startup that has made its name with technology that detects problems with unified communications systems, is now turning its attention to the burgeoning software-defined networking market. Company officials on July 8 unveiled the Netsocket Virtual Network (NVN) suite of products aimed at the network virtualization and software-defined network (SDN) spaces. The technology is designed to enable businesses to create more automated, flexible networks while driving down their operating and capital expenses.
FALL RIVER -- Police responded to the McDonald’s on Plymouth Avenue early Sunday morning after a man fired a gun at a delivery driver who refused to buy him a hamburger, according to police. The driver, a 36-year-old Taunton man, worked for an “internet food delivery service,” Fall River Police Detective John Robinson said. The man told police he was waiting in line at the 300 Plymouth Ave. restaurant drive-thru at about 3:30 a.m. picking up food for a client. An unidentified man sitting in the back seat of another vehicle yelled at him, said Robinson.
I marched a hole in my shoes the first time. It was 2006. His name was Martin Lee Anderson and he was 14 and had been sent to boot camp in Panama City, Fla. He had stolen his grandmother’s car. She sent him to be redirected. Instead, he was killed. Seven guards. One nurse. Eight acquittals. So we marched from the campus to the Florida Capitol. As a member of the FAMU chapter of the NAACP, I held the banner. I would march many more times—for many different reasons—but there was nothing like that first time.
When city commissioners begin workshops on next year's budget, they will consider recommendations to eliminate several city departments. Cody & Associates Inc., management consultants hired to study job classifications and pay plans, have recommended the city disband the industrial development and civil defense functions on a city level and eliminate the airport department and the golf course operations. City Manager Irene Beckham said she hasn't done any cost projections to determine if the moves would be cost effective. She said the recommendations simply would take some functions and put them under other departments in a reorganization move.
This is the third part in an ongoing series of retellings of the Parable of the Good Samaritan. Read Part 1: The God Samaritan and Part 2: The Wrong Samaritan. The preacher had chosen a rather appropriate text this morning, the lawmaker thought, seeing how fruits and vegetables growing on farms across the state were rotting in the fields rather than being picked. To be honest, it worried the lawmaker. This was a beloved teacher — his favorite really. He had been looking forward to his biannual message here at the Baptist church.
on Oct. 17 and it seemed to be the trap wedding of our dreams. Every star, from Diddy to Big Sean, showed up decked in all-white for the nuptials. While the photos of the happy newlyweds and their party guests looked incredible, everyone seems to be talking about Gucci’s artist Ralo, who gave a rather comedic interview at the red carpet event. Like many other guests, Ralo stepped on the carpet for a brief interview with Karrueche and Kendall Kyndall. He was supposed to share a couple of well wishes for the couple and move on, but fans got a few minutes of comedy relief instead.
Top Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades: AIG, Freeport-McMoRan, Frontier Communications, Noble Energy, Occidental, Spark Therapeutics, Target and More - 24/7 Wall St.
Stocks were indicated higher on Wednesday after the elections results basically went as the pre-vote polls had indicated. While there has been a big bounce off last week’s lows, investors have seen lower upside after buying immediately after the big market pullbacks than in prior years. The investing community needs to consider how to position their investments for the rest of the year and into 2019. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week.
Drivers can now use the internet to report problems like potholes and fallen trees on roads in Cambridgeshire, and keep track of any repairs. First, motorists log on to the Cambridgeshire County Council website to report a fault by clicking on a map to pinpoint the exact location. Once an issue is reported, the person who reported it can return to the website at a later date to check progress on repairs. It's thought the new system will also save time for County Council staff because they'll have to deal with fewer telephone calls and emails.
KHARTOUM: Sudan’s Prime Minister Moataz Moussa announced to parliament on Wednesday a 15-month emergency economic-reform plan, including “further strict austerity measures,” to begin this month. In September, 11 months after the United States lifted 20-year-old trade sanctions, Bashir dissolved his government, citing Sudan’s “state of distress and frustration,” and slashed a third of ministries to cut costs. CAIRO: Huawei will roll out its 5G phone network for the first time during this summer’s Africa Cup of Nations, Egypt’s minister of communications and information technology said on Sunday.

In the melee of communications, gone are the days of strictly one-on-one communications. Everything that is said or heard becomes fit for wider consumption, discussion or debate. There are no secrets anymore that stay within closed doors of a corporate boardroom, an appraisal session or a family dinner. A private comment has the potential to go viral as a Facebook post or Twitter feed. For every message, there is likely to be an accomplice, a bystander, an eavesdropper, a reporter, a promoter, an influencer, a detractor... It’s not about social media, it’s about heightened social messaging consumption.
Vinnie and Gazza set for island show? Vinnie Jones wants to help Paul Gascoigne by taking him on a desert island for a TV show, it’s been reported. The Hollywood actor wants to film the former England footballer – who has previously been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and battled alcoholism – with a handheld camera for the project, which he sees as a chance for Gazza to help himself by going hunting and fishing, reports The Sun. An insider said: “Vinnie thinks it’s terrible what Gazza has been going through and is convinced some tough love is needed.
Published: June 22, 2013 10:37 a.m. It is a known fact that several snacks and drinks commonly available in American grocery stores are unhealthy. However, some common foods are so unhealthy, they're banned in other countries. As first highlighted by Buzzfeed, a new book titled "Rich Food Poor Food" by Dr. Jason Calton and certified nutritionist Mira Calton features a section solely dedicated to a list of banned ingredients, including where they are banned and what caused governments to ban them. One of the most common ingredients that has been banned in some countries is artificial food coloring.
Brighouse Town led another two goal lead slip yesterday when they were held 3-3 at home by Bamber Bridge in the Evo-Stik NPL. They looked to have bright prospects of a first home win since December 2 when a Dan Grimshaw penalty gave them a 3-1 advantage with 20 minutes left. However, it was a familiar tale as Brighouse were unable to close out the game, Gary Pett narrowing the gap on 76 minutes and Regan Linney getting Bridge’s equaliser with four minutes left. Brighouse dropped a place to 18th following a 3-1 win for Atherton Collieries over Mossley.
The Republican candidate was appointed to the New Mexico Supreme Court in March by Gov. Susana Martinez. Gary Clingman said he knows the unique needs of southeast New Mexico well. His father worked in the oil fields, and as a teen, Clingman joined in. He later studied law and opened a practice in Hobbs in the 1980s. Then, in 1997 Clingman became a district judge in Lea County, serving the Fifth Judicial District. The Republican candidate was appointed to the New Mexico Supreme Court in March by Gov. Susana Martinez, and said his representation of the state’s southeast corner was a rarity.

Chancellor George Osborne has declared his commitment to fight for "full employment" in Britain. Speaking to workers at Tilbury Port in Essex, he said his "ambition" was for Britain to achieve the highest employment rate of any of the developed nations of the G7. The Conservative government won't seek to lower the unemployment rate by creating "artificial" public sector jobs, which ended up destroying employment as public spending spiraled out of control, says George Osborne. "You end up with more people unemployed instead of less. Then the politicians who make these guarantees get into a panic.
On Wednesday Google added a new feature to Google Maps that allows users to view 3D photo tours of more than 15,000 popular landmarks from around the world. Tours include famous attractions such as Central Park in New York, the Half Dome and Yosemite National Park, the Queen's residence, Buckingham Palace in London, the Trevi Fountain in Rome, as well as many others. Users should search Google Maps for their desired landmark, and results in the left hand side of the screen will show whether a photo tour is available for that particular attraction.
A new variant of the Sazoora data-hijacking trojan has compromised 23,000 machines across enterprises in Europe and the US, researchers say. Seculert CTO Aviv Raff said the malware struck the machines from late last month affecting companies in Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and the US. An older version hit users in Slovakia via a tax return spam hoax that at the time was described by anti-virus firm ESET as an “ordinary credentials-stealing trojan” which used HTML injects to collect data from users' Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome browsers. Raff said the malware was now more capable, notably in evading detection and proliferation.
Good post especially point 8 on the SLA detente. With nearly all of the Cloud Providers that I've worked with as s Consultant it's amazing how their SLAs are only centred around uptime and availability. This is quite ironic in that you wouldn't buy a PC for example based on the fact that it will turn on and stay turned on when its performance is atrocious! It is here where I think the Cloud will certainly need to mature as more and more critical applications are considered for it. SLAs need to be refined around performance metrics as opposed to just uptime and availability.
Fiji Airways Drua coach, Senirusi Seruvakula has praised the new find, Levani Kurumudu who played a gallant game on the wing for the Drua against Melbourne Rising in their first match of Australia’s National Rugby Championship. The Suva wing was instrumental in Drua’s attack and defense and also scored the Drua’s first try in his debut match where the Drua thrashed Melbourne Rising 40‑17. Seruvakula says Kurumudu will definitely go a long way and he is showing similar playing style of Eroni Sau. Fiji Airways Drua scored a total of six tries against Melbourne Rising and is currently leading the points table with five points.
Here’s something I’m positive no one saw coming: Warner Bros. is planning an Aquaman spin-off…that’s also a horror movie. The Trench will focus on the monstrous trench creatures revealed in James Wan‘s Aquaman. Wan will produce the spin-off, which is said to have a much lower budget than the recent DC blockbuster. THR broke the news about The Trench, a horror movie spin-off of James Wan’s Aquaman. The film will focus on the Lovecraftian Trench creatures that Jason Momoa and Amber Heard encounter in Wan’s box office smash.
RIO DE JANEIRO – Brazil’s biggest environmental disaster, which left 19 dead and nearly 400 families homeless, struck three years ago this Monday – three years of unkept promises with none of those responsible convicted of any crime. On Nov. 5, 2015, two dams built to contain mine tailings at the Samarco complex in Mariana, Minas Gerais state, gave way, allowing a flood of mud and mine waste that wiped out seven hamlets and contaminated a 650-kilometer (405-mile) stretch of the Doce River. The Brazilian government called the accident in the southeastern state the worst environmental disaster in the nation’s history.
HONOLULU – When Ray Lewis stepped off the plane from his cross-country flight and was greeted with a lei and an aloha, it finally hit him that he’s been voted back on the island. Today’s Pro Bowl marks the return to Hawaii – where it had been since 1980 – after spending a year in Miami in an experiment by the NFL to combine the All-Star game activities with the Super Bowl. Hawaii is paying $4 million per game to hold the Pro Bowl this year and in 2012 as the state deals with a projected $844 million deficit over the next 2 1/2 years.

Anti-corruption lawyer and environmentalist Zuzana Caputova has been elected as the first female president of Slovakia. Caputova, who has no prior experience in political office, won with 58% votes against her opponent Maros Sefcovic with 42% of the votes. Caputova is due to take the office from June 2019. She gained popularity for a decade-long struggle against the situating of a toxic landfill in her hometown of Pezinok. For this she was awarded a 2016 Goldman Environmental Prize. She cited Jan Kuciak’s murder as one the reason she decided to run for president, which is a largely a ceremonial role.
The Chargers’ Corey Liuget is suing his former trainer over a failed performance-enhancing drug test that resulted in the defensive tackle’s current four-game suspension. The suit, filed Tuesday in Los Angeles, says Ian Danney — without Liuget’s knowledge — injected him with a substance banned by the NFL. Liuget contends that Danney told him he was using an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory to treat pain following a game last season. The suit also alleges Danney gave Liuget another product that required a prescription that Liuget did not have. Liuget is seeking no less than $15 million in damages because of lost wages, pain and suffering.
A small black-stenciled painting of an apron-wearing mouse saying, "Paul Horner I come for you," appeared on the wall of the Lost Leaf Bar and Gallery off Roosevelt Row in Phoenix this weekend. It is done in the style of British street artist and provocateur Banksy. But it is not by Banksy. A fake story on the News Examiner site purports to talk to Banksy's publicist, and cites interviews with 12 News, CNN and ABC 15, none of which actually happened. The story also runs quotes falsely attributed to 12 News during an interview with a Lost Leaf owner named Tom.
Long-term investments to address the social determinants of health are essential interventions to curbing the addictions crisis in Indiana. According to new figures from the Centers of Disease of Control and Prevention, the number of drug overdose deaths in Indiana in 2017 totaled 1,808. That represents a 15.1 percent increase from 2016. The data show a flattening of the death rate nationally with some states even showing modest decreases in their death toll. However, there is little to cheer for those of us in the upper Midwest and Southern regions where the opioid overdose epidemic maintains its tragically strong grip.
New Hampshire-based Infrastructure-as-a-Service company Dyn announced today that it would purchase managed DNS provider Nettica. Terms were not disclosed.

For August 27: when did the UN ask to visit the site at Ghouta? While the delay from Wednesday to Sunday (or Monday, when the team got out and said, if this YouTube video is not false, that they are not even looking at what type of munition was used in part because they didn't want to put it in their white UN 4 by 4) is now an element in the case for missile strikes, Syria says the UN didn't even ASK until Saturday. Is that true? Even if the UK, for example, asked earlier, it is a UN team.
Updated at 4:45 p.m. ET: Officials in Oklahoma said four people were found shot dead at a Tulsa apartment on Monday. Police responded to the scene in the south part of Tulsa at around 12:30 p.m. local time, where four women were found dead inside the Fairmont Terrace apartments, NBC station KJRH reported. "The victims were shot multiple times," Tulsa Police Officer Jillian Roberson confirmed in a statement to NBC News. Authorities also found an unharmed 4-year-old child in the apartment, Roberson said. The child was taken into protective custody.
TWO flattened vehicles with three bodies inside have been removed from the rubble of the 950-tonne pedestrian bridge that collapsed near Florida International University, Miami police said this morning. The vehicles - a white Chevy pickup truck and gold Jeep Cherokee - were covered in black tarps and transported to the medical examiner's office with the bodies inside. The Miami Herald reported that one of the bodies belonged to Rolando Fraga, 60. Mr Fraga's nephew, Jorge, had said yesterday that people had seen his Cherokee near the bridge. Fraga lived in the area and frequently took the nearby highway to work.
Stoudemire has a home in Miami and likes the idea of playing here. He will meet with Heat president Pat Riley on Friday morning. Green’s acquisition not only significantly improves the Heat’s bench but also addresses Miami’s need for long-range shooting. The Heat ranked 24th in the NBA in three-point percentage last season. Green, 6-8, has shot 36.8 percent from three-point range in his career, higher than any other guard or small forward on the Heat roster except Tyler Johnson. The 29-year-old Green has done it despite losing a significant portion of his right ring finger in a basketball accident in the sixth grade.
SINGAPORE- It was a close shave for 35-year-old Kim Sung Mo, the South Korean who was rescued by about 30 passers-by after he was hit by a trailer truck at the junction of Boon Keng Road and Bendemeer Road. Mr Kim escaped with a leg fracture and underwent surgery at Tan Tock Seng hospital on Wednesday night. "I felt very scared after I got knocked down. I was lucky that there was this group of helpful passers-by who rushed to lift the truck and pull me out in time," he said from his hospital bed in comments reported by evening daily Lianhe Wanbao yesterday.

"We’re not surprised to see competitors imitate our success." If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Dunkin’ should take McDonald’s newest breakfast item as validation for their own eccentric creations. Business Insider reported Wednesday that McDonald’s is planning to launch a new product called “Donut Sticks” in February. According to internal company documents, the fried dough strips will be served in bundles and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. If the concept seems familiar, it’s because it looks and sounds pretty much identical to the donut fries Dunkin’ launched nationwide for a limited time last June.
Australian road traffic authorities can begin the roll out of intelligent transport systems (ITS) that enable vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-person, or vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, thanks to new regulations introduced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) on Thursday. The Radiocommunications (Intelligent Transport Systems) Class Licence 2017 regulations allow the 5.9 GHz band to be used for ITS in Australia, and will support the use of complying wireless technologies and devices. The new regulations also make the local guidelines consistent with the ITS arrangements in major vehicle markets such as the United States and European Union, ACMA explained.
There's a cheaper way to pay for major renovations when purchasing or refinancing a home. A little-known federal loan program will finance the purchase and more than $5,000 in renovations, with less money down and lower interest costs. The program offering loans insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development is known as the Section 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program. Although available since the 1970s, lenders only recently began offering 203(k) loans, after rules were changed to reduce their risks. Loans are available to individuals or investors for residential property with as many as four living units.

Fire alarms are tested to ensure malfunctions won't prevent them from sounding if there is a fire. Fire alarms are installed most often in commercial buildings and large structures like apartment complexes. They may also be used as part of residential security systems. Fire alarms emit an alarm when smoke or heat is detected, but if the unit is not able to sense smoke or heat, or if it cannot emit the alarm, then it is not doing its job. Fire alarms must be tested annually with specialized tools to ensure they are in proper working condition.
A British World Cup rugby fan has been killed in a New Zealand waterfall after jumping over a safety barrier for a closer look. Friends tried to save him as he slipped on the edge but they were only able to hold on to his arms for a short time before he fell in and disappeared under the water. The body of 39-year-old Ian Oliver Randall, originally from England, was pulled out of the Maruia Falls on the South Island by a police diving squad. He had been under water at the base of the tourist beauty spot near Murchison for almost a day.
Starting work in August would allow most work to be done before the worst of the winter weather makes roads icy, according to federal officials. The project will require 5,000 truckloads of grout. “What DOE is asking is to take irreversible action — put grout in that tunnel — before the the public process really has a chance to get off the ground,” said Alex Smith, Ecology’s Nuclear Waste Program manager. But many worry about the decaying tunnel and upcoming winter weather. A video inspection of the inside of the second tunnel shows corrosion of bolts and weld plates.
LONDON (Reuters) - London’s skyline is changing fast, pierced by gleaming new skyscrapers which defy predictions of a Brexit-related slowdown in the capital’s two financial districts. With only six months until Britain is due to leave the European Union, the terms of its separation have yet to be decided, leaving critical questions over the long-term future of London as the bloc’s pre-eminent financial center. Some politicians and economists expect the split will damage the City, as the capital’s traditional financial services center is widely known, while Brexit supporters say it will benefit from being able to set its own rules.

Generations of Hawaii diners have flocked to The Willows Restaurant since the Moiliili eatery opened in 1944, and have continually enjoyed the tranquil setting and robust buffet spreads offered at the iconic establishment. While Hawaii’s original and favorite garden restaurant continues to serve up traditional Hawaiian food and other favorites at its lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch buffets, some recent changes at the eatery have led to the inclusion of local comfort food selections that have both customers and staff clamoring for second servings. Executive chef Craig Yasaka took the helm at The Willows Sept. 21 when previous executive chef Miles Miyamoto was handed the reins of Karai Crab.
There isn't any reason why commercials directing should have anything to do with race, but with so few black directors in the business - who comes readily to mind besides Paul Hunter? - the arrival of Chris Robinson, with a string of hip-hop video hits behind him, makes one wonder if he can escape the marketing ghetto politely filed under "urban." In his favor, surely, is the fact that he's at an A-list company like Partizan, where, as far as Robinson and Partizan executive producer Steve Dickstein are concerned, race will not be much of an issue.

SACRAMENTO — A protracted political battle over California's medical malpractice law may be coming to a new front: the voting booth. For decades, trial lawyers and consumer groups have railed against limits on certain damages in malpractice cases, arguing that such restrictions deny victims fair compensation for grisly medical mistakes. Insurance companies, doctors and other healthcare providers have been equally vigorous in defending the law, saying it is crucial to controlling costs and maintaining the availability of care. Now, the lawyers' side has proposed a ballot initiative that would raise the limits on malpractice awards for pain and suffering.
Quebecor Inc. bought back a $38-million slice of its operating arm from its home province’s public pension fund on the heels of a windfall from selling its wireless spectrum licences. Quebecor Media announced Thursday it bought and cancelled about 540,000 shares from Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, slightly reducing the Caisse’s interest in the company to 18.47 per cent from about 18.9 per cent. Analysts have been speculating that Quebecor would buy back Caisse shares after it sold its unused spectrum licences outside the province for approximately $614 million in June.
After the martyrdom of St. Boniface, Vergilius was made Bishop of Salzburg (766 or 767) and laboured successfully for the upbuilding of his diocese as well as for the spread of the Faith in neighbouring heathen countries, especially in Carinthia. He died at Salzburg, 27 November, 789. In 1233 he was canonized by Gregory IX. His doctrine that the earth is a sphere was derived from the teaching of ancient geographers, and his belief in the existence of the antipodes was probably influenced by the accounts which the ancient Irish voyagers gave of their journeys.
LUCKNOW: While pesticide and insecticide toxicity and environmental degradation are causes for growing concern, several alternative cropping practices are being increasingly explored as ‘healthy’ agricultural practices. LUCKNOW: While pesticide and insecticide toxicity and environmental degradation are causes for growing concern, several alternative cropping practices are being increasingly explored as â€˜healthyâ€™ agricultural practices. Prominent among these, are organic farming, nature farming, angara, rishi krishi, panch kavya, biodynamic farming, etc. The most outstanding aspect of biodynamic farming is that none of the inputs are purchased from outside.
Zara Phillips made a winning start to the eventing season in Hampshire on Thursday. The Queen's granddaughter, eventing world champion aboard Toytown six years ago, has an outside chance of making a five-strong Great Britain team for London 2012. William Fox-Pitt, Mary King, Piggy French and Nicola Wilson are widely expected to fill four of the places for Britain's Olympic medal bid at Greenwich Park in late July. Phillips could then be among a clutch of riders - including the likes of double Olympic bronze medalist Tina Cook, multiple major championship medal-winner Pippa Funnell and 2009 Badminton and Burghley champion Oliver Townend - contesting the fifth spot.
Over at the Lyric Stage Company of Boston, the revival of “Souvenir” is so bad it’s funny. And that’s just the way they want it. For the past month or so, director Spiro Veloudos and actress Leigh Barrett have been on a quest for imperfection. That’s the goal when you’re telling the life story of Florence Foster Jenkins, a New York socialite who tortured friends and strangers with her tone-deaf recitals. That’s why Barrett loves her. It’s an odd twist of Jenkins’ story that she didn’t just toil in obscurity.

Toshiba says it has developed a new LCD panel for 3D glasses which will cut down on headache-inducing 3D crosstalk. The new OCB (Optically Compensated Bend) LCD panels will be used for shuttered 3D glasses which trick the brain into seeing three dimensional images by rapidly blocking off each eye in turn, synchronised with the left and right eye images which are shown sequentially on the viewing screen. Until now, shuttered 3D glasses have been susceptible to 3D crosstalk which is where the left eye senses the right eye image leading to blurred vision and user fatigue.
Western sanctions and a paranoid government make Iran’s economy a unique challenge. After Iran’s nuclear agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with six world powers (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom), many outside businesses are enthusiastic to enter the Iranian market. Meanwhile, to boost Iran’s collapsed economy, the country’s moderate forces—a coalition of progressive politicians, intellectuals and pragmatic conservatives headed by President Hassan Rouhani, who advocates reintegrating Iran into the global market—are encouraging foreign partners and investors to invest in Iran.
After months of back-and-forth and setbacks in their journey to exhume bodies at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, a team of anthropological researchers from the University of South Florida on Wednesday was awarded a more-than-$420,000 research grant by the U.S. Department of Justice. The team, led by Drs. Erin Kimmerle and Christian Wells, has been working nonstop to provide answers for the families of boys who were sent to Dozier during its 111-year history. They will be exhuming remains from the school grounds and will attempt to link identities to the remains through DNA testing.
Members of the European Parliament have called for increased efforts in dealing with the Rohingya crisis, after learning about the appalling conditions in refugee camps in Bangladesh. EURACTIV’s partner efe-epa reports from Kutupalong, Bangladesh. Around 688,000 Rohingyas have fled to Bangladesh over the last five months, escaping violence in Myanmar amid accusations against the army of ethnic cleansing and human rights violations. “It’s a huge challenge for Bangladesh and also for international organisations. We must strengthen our efforts to give support, especially to the organisations involved here,” German MEP Joachim Zeller (EPP) told EFE.
Deep breaths: we now exist within the same calendar year as the release date for the eighth episode of Star Wars. Frankly, it's surprising that it took an entire nine days into 2017 before we got some official, big Star Wars news. USA Today published an interview with Star Wars VIII director Rain Johnson in which he reveals some key information about this year's film. Star Wars VIII will begin exactly where Star Wars VII left off—with Rey handing Jedi Master Luke Skywalker his old lightsaber on a cliff. This is new for Star Wars, as every episode has started a few years after the previous film.
The Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (CEO Jung Jae-hoon) employees were caught up in lackadaisical service behavior. Critics say that KHNP may have been convicted for such conducts due lack of security documents, ordering employees to do private duties, sexually harassing female employees, leaving their working areas, driving under the influence of alcohol and verbally harassing employees. The ‘Energy Economy Newspaper’ reported on August 27th that KHNP’s audit report was obtained and analyzed, revealing that this kind of behavior was revealed. According to reports, a total of 12 teams were missing 14 office security regulations before and after June 13 local elections.
AMES, Iowa - Violent crime rates are taking a nosedive across the nation, according to a data from the FBI, and Ames is one city topping the list. Data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report analyzed by 24/7 Wall St. shows violent crime fell to 355.5 incidents per 100,000 residents - the lowest it's been in decades. Violent crime peaked in the 1990s, but has steadily declined over the past 20 years. The data analyzed looks at a five-year span, from 2010 to 2014, and ranks Dubuque and Ames as the #1 and #2 cities in the U.S. where crime has plummeted the most.
Colton Moore, 24, qualified to run for Georgia House District 1 on Friday. He said he was born and raised in Dade County and graduated from the University of Georgia in 2016. Colton Moore sat in the balcony of the Georgia House of Representatives on Friday morning. Not much was going on, besides some lawmakers recognizing visitors to the state capitol. Still, he felt excited. He looked at the floor of the chamber and envisioned himself, standing there in 10 months. Moore had just qualified to run against State Rep. John Deffenbaugh, R-Lookout Mountain, in the Republican Primary for the House District 1 seat.
THE IDIOT: What is wrong? P: There is an elephant in the room! I: Is that a bad thing? P: As you should know from our history, elephants trample things, and destroy rooms. They are wicked, wicked creatures! Wicked and dangerous! I: Ooooh, that's terrifying! Where is this beast? I: Ooooh! My golly! That is a nasty looking creature, and what rude language! But.... are you sure that is an elephant? P: Don't tell me you are an elephant denialist!
JERUSALEM – Israel signaled flexibility and openness toward the emerging new Palestinian leadership Friday, with a top adviser to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon saying peace talks could resume if the Palestinians showed some good will. The adviser, Raanan Gissin (search), spoke a day after Sharon indicated he is dropping a key demand for resuming peace talks — a Palestinian crackdown on militant groups. Sharon said that while he still wants the armed groups dismantled at some point, he now considers Palestinian efforts to stop incitement against Israel a sufficient first step. "Israel is ready to move forward," Gissin said.

Patience many be a virtue, but only for a while. A patient. Schweitzer-influenced fellow may choose to let a bug crawl onto his foot and even up his leg, but eventually he will repel the bug and squash it with his foot. @monkey no need to keep on changing names. I would move away from a bug before it even touched me. Those things are creepy. You will be non-existent by the year 2025. Your oil refineries will be bombed and completely destroyed . You will go broke. You have too many enemies and killed too many innocent.

Above: Clandestine: Anomaly takes on New York City. Next week will mark the launch of a game that shouldn’t exist. Corey King, a Canadian artist with zero game development experience, dreamed up Clandestine: Anomaly and named himself Chief Executive Artist at ZenFri, Inc. He wanted to tap into storytelling using a medium he’d never worked in: augmented reality (AR), where images and content is layered over the real world. Instead of starting small, he created an ambitious plan, won the hearts of volunteers, and obtained the financial backing to create a prototype.
Published: June 15, 2016 at 02:38 p.m. The Buffalo Bills are keeping LeSean McCoy on the sidelines during minicamp this week and will continue to monitor the running back's snaps throughout training camp and preseason. Bills running backs coach Anthony Lynn said Wednesday the rest of this offseason is "by design" to "keep him fresh, going into his eighth year, (there is) a lot of miles on those legs. So we'll do the same thing (throughout) training camp with him," per ESPN's Mike Rodak. Lynn added the Bills will use McCoy sparingly during preseason games.
Published by the Pirate FM News Team at 9:28am 19th January 2012. It is hoped a holiday retreat inspired by a terminally ill little girl from Looe will become a reality by the end of the year.

When Compaq bought rival computer-maker Digital last spring, analysts wondered what fate lay in store for AltaVista, Digital's once-prominent, but fading, search engine. Compaq bought Digital, after all, to bolster its high-end hardware and service offerings for corporate customers. Where did a search engine fit in? It seemed likely that AltaVista would wither on the vine. But it didn't. First, Compaq (CPQ) shelled out $3.35 million dollars to buy the rights to the altavista.com URL, replacing the clunky altavista.digital.com moniker. Next, the company poured $10 million dollars into fleshing out the site's services.
The last time we wrote about Google TV Ads, it was due to a defeat: NBC Universal had ended an advertising partnership. But it looks like that wasn’t entirely indicative of things to come, as Google announced today that it’s managed to sign a partnership with Verizon FiOS TV. One of Google’s biggest victories in terms of television advertising partnerships has unraveled. Google and NBC Universal have dissolved the pact they established two years ago, meaning would-be advertisers will lose access to a number of high-profile channels.
Led Zeppelin have the first of two ‘greatest hits’ albums released on November 22. ‘Early Days – The Best Of Led Zeppelin Volume 1’ features material drawn from the band’s first four classic albums along with some rare material of the band in 1969 playing ‘Communicatiuon Breakdown’. The tracks were selected by former Zep guitarist Jimmy Page – now working on a solo project as is ex-singer Robert Plant leading to speculation that the two have decided to go their separate ways again, though a recent statement from Atlantic records in the US claims that they will work together again.
AUSTRALIANS were today branded sore losers after accusing Ireland of cheating in the Rugby World Cup. Double World Cup winner Tim Horan caused a storm today by claiming that Brian O'Driscoll's squad deliberately faked injuries. Horan claimed he was told of the plan by Irish assistant coach Alan Gaffney in the dressing rooms after the historic win. Today Ireland and Leinster legend Trevor Brennan said the comments showed why the Australia team were hated on the international scene. "Ireland had a deliberate plan to fake injuries each time there was a breakdown in play last Saturday, so they could slow the game down and frustrate the Wallabies," Horan said.
A Banksy artwork painted on the side of a steelworker’s garage has been sold to an art dealer for a “six-figure sum”. John Brandler, 63, who owns Brandler Galleries in Essex, England said he had agreed the mural could be kept in its current location in Port Talbot, South Wales, for a minimum of two years. Steelworker Ian Lewis, 55, said it was like “Christmas had come early” after the work appeared on the side of his garage in the Taibach area on December 18th, but later confessed he was “struggling” to manage with the attention.
Mumbai, June 10: Cranky U.S. talk-show hosts, John Kerry and powerful British union leaders have all had their say. Now it's the turn of a Catholic priest in India's money capital, Mumbai. Outsourcing has a new critic. From a church pulpit in a middle-class suburb one sultry Sunday morning, Father K.T. Emmanuel spelled out the biggest danger facing the city's young men and women: call centers. In the congregation were scores of 20-somethings who spend their nights fielding calls from the customers of U.S. multinational giants such as General Electric and Time Warner.
UNITED STATES—Even with the rain, the streets are seething, something is on edge in people and a little precipitation isn’t making a dent. On a recent rainy night, I took my dog, DeVille, who is kind of an insurance policy against madness and outbreaks of insanity commonplace in Hollywood out, but tonight his magic powers were a little off. From the onset, I was inclined to give him use of my phone. But then, instead of coming up to me and taking the phone, he stood by the back entrance and gave me an explanation.
Walter Graf, a Los Angeles cardiologist who pioneered the training of paramedics, has died. He was 98. As recently as the 1960s, a patient being rushed to the hospital with crushing chest pain would be treated en route only with sirens and sympathy. Alarmed by high death rates and encouraged by new technology, a small group of pioneering physicians started equipping ambulances with defibrillators and paramedics who knew how to use them. Although today the idea seems straightforward, it was a radical departure from established protocols and was credited with saving countless lives.
Can the FIFA scandal lead to reform? The world's football body is under pressure to make sweeping changes. The ongoing scandal involving top FIFA officials has pushed many to publicly call for a whole structural change with this organisation.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration has vowed to revive the coal industry, challenged climate-change science and blasted renewable energy as expensive and dependent on government subsidies. And yet the solar power industry is booming across Trump country, fueled by falling development costs and those same subsidies, which many Republicans in Congress continue to support. Data provided to Reuters by GTM Research, a clean energy market information firm, shows that eight of the 10 fastest-growing U.S. solar markets between the second quarters of 2016 and 2017 were Western, Midwestern or Southern states that voted for Trump, with Alabama and Mississippi topping the list.
OKLAHOMA CITY—Saying he respects the gay and lesbian community, Canadian basketball star Andrew Wiggins tried Wednesday to clarify comments he made about Oklahoma City Thunder guard Dennis Schroder’s behaviour during a heated game. Thunder centre Nerlens Noel was taken off the court on a stretcher in the third quarter after Wiggins, a Timberwolves forward, collided with Noel on a dunk attempt Tuesday night. Schroder, unhappy about the play and other incidents in what was a testy game, eventually was given a technical foul for an altercation with Timberwolves guard Jeff Teague. A few hours later, Wiggins tried on social media to clarify his comments.

Gaetano Berardi has become the latest Leeds United player to agree a new contract, extending his deal at Elland Road to 2020. The full-back’s previous contract was due to expire next summer but Leeds have moved to tie down an established member of their first-team squad just one game into the new term. Berardi installed himself as first-choice left-back midway through last season, replacing Charlie Taylor after Taylor suffered an Achilles injury, and he was named in Thomas Christiansen’s side for United’s first match of the Championship campaign at Bolton Wanderers on Sunday.
An officer talks to people who had been hoping to be escorted to pick up possessions from their homes inside an evacuation zone on October 11, 2017 in Napa, California. Gusting winds and dry air forecast for Thursday could drive the next wave of devastating wildfires that are already well on their way to becoming the deadliest and most destructive in California history. Winds up to 45 mph were expected to pummel areas north of San Francisco, where at least 23 people have died and at least 3,500 homes and businesses have been destroyed. These conditions could erase modest gains made by firefighters.
Wildlife experts have warned that the rare red-footed falcon in the Cambridgeshire Fens is "not an isolated incident". The protected bird of prey was found dead found dead near Whittlesey last month. An X-ray confirmed it had been shot. The RSPB has warned that birds of prey being are killed in the British countryside almost every week. The Bedfordshire-based charity is offering a £1,000 reward for anyone who has information on the shooting of the falcon. Last year there were 91 known birds of prey victims in the UK. Of those, 15 were in the East of England.

Congress activists on Tuesday held a protest outside the Churchgate railway station in south Mumbai against rising prices of petrol and diesel. Congress workers under city unit president Sanjay Nirupam demanded that petroleum products be brought under the ambit of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Nirupam said while crude oil prices are on downhill globally, they are skyrocketing in the country, especially in Mumbai where petrol is sold at Rs 80.80 per litre and diesel at Rs 68 per litre. He accused the NDA government of "betraying" the common people by not keeping the promises made by the BJP ahead of 2014 polls.
Welcome to Metro’s wine guide. Every week wine connoisseur Nina Caplan will review the best tipples from around the world. Bottoms up! If the wine world is a family – and given the squabbles and rivalries, it probably wouldn’t be one you’d want to spend Christmas with, if so – then South Africa is the baby, struggling to catch up with its older siblings. Like every other wine journalist the world over, I find a champagne column as obligatory at this time of year as a shopping splurge.
Apple and Facebook are cash flow kings. Cash-cow stocks like Apple and Facebook often make for winning investments. Image source: Getty Images. Investors can often find stock market winners by looking for companies that generate a lot of cash on a consistent basis. A strong free cash flow – which is the cash that a company generates from its operations that is left over after it makes necessary investments in its business – enables a company to pay dividends, buy back shares of its stock, and grow the business via acquisitions and in other ways.
In the forthcoming testimony of Lt. Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, a likely main story line has already emerged: Iraq’s military situation is improved, but its national political situation is not. Together these dueling realities make it hard to give up on the surge in one sense, yet hard to know how long we should keep risking young American GIs when Iraqi top leaders dither and quarrel in another. At a more detailed military level, another theme seems likely to be discussed by Gen. Petraeus and Mr. Crocker — the distinction between different types of violence in Iraq.
She loves the college life — just not the classes. Hunter College is waging a court battle to evict a stubborn student who refuses to leave her dorm room some two years after dropping out. Delaware native Lisa S. Palmer — who has not paid rent since 2016 — refuses to leave Room E579 at the school’s 425 E. 25th St. co-ed dormitory, according to an eviction lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. The 32-year-old “racked up a staggering $94,000 in unpaid residence hall charges on account of her continued occupancy, all the while ignoring Hunter College’s service of additional vacate notices,” said the suit.
Ten years ago, my sister Laura and I were in Greenwich Village at a restaurant near Washington Square Park. We stood all afternoon, hopped up at New York City’s Gay Pride Parade. I’ve told you one of my hobbies is eavesdropping. And on that particular evening, my nervous system vibrated from nearby conversation. Soon I was leaning. Leaning to hear more. So much so, I apologized and then further infringed. “May I add something?” The two nodded. I intro’d Laura, intro’d myself.
Family doctors have been told to stop prescribing homeopathy following a landmark ruling in the High Court. At least 400 GPs still practise the controversial treatment even though there is no evidence it works. And many others refer patients to specialist homeopathy clinics or doctors at their request, with the Health Service picking up the bill. In December, NHS England issued guidelines to doctors telling them to avoid prescribing homeopathy as part of a general crackdown on waste. But they were taken to the High Court by the British Homeopathic Association who argued the treatment had ‘amazing outcomes’.

A few months ago, there were talks of a big-ticket action flick with Hrithik Roshan, but Mirror has learnt that the film has been put on the backburner for now.

Atlanta is an ideal destination for sports fans, Southern literature enthusiasts and everyone in between. It's one of the most easily accessible cities in the United States; nearly 80 percent of the U.S. population is within a two-hour flight. What to pack for a weekend in Atlanta depends largely on your itinerary and the season. The weather is generally mild, but the Southern heat and humidity can be brutal in the summer. If your weekend will primarily be spent cheering on the Falcons or Braves, pack three comfortable, casual outfits.
A gunman opened fire on a police officer during a routine highway traffic stop, shooting him in the face before speeding off again. Omar Maria, 33, who was later captured during a standoff with other officers, pulled his weapon on cop Jacob Baldwin in Kansas City, Missouri, in December 2014.

It’s been a pretty good year for Backblaze. The company that started out as a personal and business backup solution has pivoted in January to include offering cloud storage solutions and has been doing quite well with it, storing over 250 terabytes worth of user data. The service, B2, started as a beta in 2015 and released in January to good review, thanks in part to its reliability and low price point. The service can be had for cheaper than almost any other option, including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure.
LeBron James and Kobe Bryant. Kobe Bryant says he's greater than Michael Jordan and LeBron James. The former Los Angeles Lakers guard made a guest appearance on Tuesday on "The Late Late Show With James Corden," where he was asked to rank the three players. He was hesitant, but the alternative was to take a bite out of a cow's tongue. Needless to say, Bryant did not want the tongue in his mouth. Kobe Bryant called himself the greatest NBA player of all time, ahead of Michael Jordan and LeBron James.
U.S. President Donald Trump has a “big ego” but he is “more honest” than former President Barack Obama, Beijing residents told the independently run South China Morning Post in a Nov. 8 feature. While independent, media analysts say the South China Morning Post often echoes the Chinese government-run media. Chinese citizens are generally expected to toe the official Chinese Communist Party line. The Xi Jinping regime has undertaken increased efforts to contain free speech on the Internet by introducing cyber-security laws designed to crack down on any political dissent taking place online.
Colombia's dot-co domain name will be opened for general availability this summer, and the company behind the move wants you to know it's not just a .com typo. .CO Internet, a joint venture between Colombia's Arcelandia and American registry Neustar, hopes to quickly make millions with dot-co domain names, based on the string's obvious semantic value rather than the fact that it looks a lot like a dot-com. "The goal in all of this is to create a very large name-space for all the millions of businesses starting up around the world on a monthly basis,” said chief executive Juan Diego Calle.
The percentage of Americans without health insurance rose in the second quarter of 2017, according to a Gallup-Sharecare survey. The uninsured rate increased to 11.7%, the second quarterly increase in a row after the rate hit a record low of 10.9% in the third and fourth quarters of 2016. The uninsured rate was 11.3% during the first quarter. Gallup-Sharecare said the rate still well below the peak of 18.0% in 2013 - just before the launch of the Affordable Care Act's individual insurance exchanges.

When Thomas Pogge travels around the world, he finds eager young fans waiting for him in every lecture hall. The 62-year-old German-born professor, a protégé of the philosopher John Rawls, is bespectacled and slight of stature. But he’s a giant in the field of global ethics, and one of only a small handful of philosophers who have managed to translate prominence within the academy to an influential place in debates about policy. A self-identified “thought leader,” Pogge directs international health and anti-poverty initiatives, publishes papers in leading journals, and gives TED Talks.

A DAY after celebrating his fourth birthday, Tyler Pershouse was confronted with an obstacle many go through life without having to face. At their Mirani home, Tyler's ability to move continuously deteriorated, declining from being unable to bend his back before becoming incapable of walking, reverting to a crawl as his only means of movement through the exceeding discomfort. Despite an initial misdiagnosis, he was eventually confirmed to have a rare strain of cancer known as Langerhans cell histiocytosis, a curable though detrimental tumour that has, at times, rendered him immobile.

How Does Exercise Lower Blood Pressure? Although high blood pressure is common, its causes are unknown. High blood pressure occurs when the arteries are narrow or constricted, making your heart work harder to supply oxygen to your body.

However, high blood pressure can lead to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, which is why it’s important to be proactive about bringing high blood pressure down. Many medications exist for lowering high blood pressure, but you may prefer to take a more natural approach to lowering blood pressure.

One man’s plane is another man’s gym. A cross-country American Airlines flight was forced to make a pit stop in Missouri late Monday after an unruly passenger used the aircraft as his own personal exercise equipment with a series of pull-ups. The flight was headed from Phoenix to Boston when it was diverted to Kansas City thanks to a reportedly intoxicated man whose in-flight work out soon turned nasty. Markoski noted that the man was stumbling and appeared visibly drunk, and quickly became verbally abusive toward a flight attendant who requested he sit down multiple times.
It’s unfortunate that the unofficial quick count of votes for vice president in the recent elections has been marred to the point that charges of poll sabotage have been filed against the Commission on Elections and officials of Smartmatic and the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV). Because of the quick count, the nation was able to know who had been elected president – Mayor Rodrigo Duterte of Davao City –within hours after the last vote was cast. It was a welcome departure from our experience in previous elections, when it took days, weeks, or even months to know who had won the presidential election.

The scoop that launched her career came in late August 1939, when she was a 27-year-old rookie reporter in southern Poland, barely a week into her job with Britain’s Daily Telegraph. The border was closed to all but diplomatic vehicles, so she borrowed a British consulate official’s car to drive into German-occupied territory. She saw tanks, armored cars and artillery massing. Returning to Poland, she filed her story, but her name was not on the byline – a common practice for newspapers in those days. She scored another scoop when the Nazis launched their invasion three days later on Sept. 1.

Zimbabwe’s first lady Grace Mugabe is expected to be charged with assault after allegedly beating up a model who was in the company of her sons in a hotel room in Johannesburg. The South African police say they are negotiating for her to hand herself over, reports say. According to an earlier statement by South Africa’s police minister Fikile Mbalula, Grace Mugabe handed herself over to the police on Tuesday and will be charged with assault. “She is not under arrest because she cooperated and handed herself over to the police. But a case has been opened,” the minister said without further details.
I usually come down here at nine in the morning, after opening up my little shop in the middle of town. I set up my equipment for the day, and usually the phone starts ringing right around 9 or a little before 9. I do my first kayak tour at 10 in the morning, so it’s a busy morning usually. This is my 25th season. I started out doing it part-time with my lawn business, but I prefer this. But I phased out of that and do this full time.
Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker says he doesn't have enough information to directly comment on a discredited theory offered by the Trump administration that busloads of Massachusetts voters crossed the state line to illegally cast ballots in New Hampshire. The Republican governor said Thursday on WGBH-FM that he doesn't know anything about New Hampshire and it bothers him when people in public life purport to know about things that they don't know about. Baker noted however that former Republican New Hampshire attorney general Tom Rath has called the allegations baseless. The governor said if Rath has dismissed the story, that's all he needs to know.
But the Blue Devils made fewer mistakes and put together a more powerful running game led by junior Hazen Weber en route to a 30-14 eight-man football victory that snapped an eight-year, 11-game losing streak to Carey teams. Weber rushed for over 200 yards and scored three touchdowns including two scores in the third quarter that wiped out a 14-8 Carey lead and put the Devils on top to stay 22-14. Kirkland lamented many Carey mistakes including lost fumbles, dropped passes that could have been touchdowns, and offsides penalties on Dietrich fourth-down situations when Carey defense had forced the Blue Devils to punt.
Local businessmen from the Ionian island of Zante (Zakynthos) are demanding the full reopening of the iconic Navagio Beach, which has remained closed since last year over safety concerns. Pavlos Kolokotsas, the mayor of the island, is under increasing pressure from local businesses to authorize the full reopening of the beach ahead of the new tourist season. In March, the president of Greece’s Geology and Geo-environmental Department, Dr. Efthimios Lekkas, laid out a new plan which included the partial reopening of the beach, including its separation into three different zones.
Ukraine's acting defence minister was dismissed on Tuesday over his handling of Russia's annexation of Crimea, after it emerged that less than a quarter of soldiers on the peninsula planned to stay in the Ukrainian military. Ihor Tenyukh, appointed a month ago under an interim government that took power after the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovich, offered his resignation in a speech to parliament following criticism of the way Ukraine pulled its military out of Crimea. Lawmakers initially rejected the offer but, after consultations between party faction leaders and parliament speaker and acting Ukrainian president Oleksander Turchinov, voted to remove him.
The campaign of Texas Democratic Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke on Friday said it had raised $38.1 million in the past three months, bringing his total to nearly $62 million — an enormous haul that makes him one of the most successful fundraisers in American politics. The three-term congressman far outstripped Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who reported raising $12 million over the past three months, bringing his total for 2017 and 2018 to about $28 million. Nevertheless, Cruz maintains a lead over O’Rourke in recent polls, with a new Quinnipiac University poll finding Cruz ahead by nine percentage points.
China has been transformed by a credit-fueled investment boom unlike anything the world has ever seen. A credit-based economy, built around what has effectively been the dollar standard, made it all possible. There’s no limit to the amount of credit that can be created under a fiat money system. And the dollar standard created a very large global boom, as U.S. dollars flooded into countries like China. Between 1990 and 2014, investment in China increased a staggering 50-fold. Between 2007 and 2014 alone, investment in China increased by 236%.
After The Camp Fire, Home Insurance In Paradise Is Harder To Find The Camp Fire in November 2018 incinerated roughly 90 percent of the homes in Paradise, Calif. Owners of the few remaining homes may find it more difficult to keep their home insured. Tom and Tamara Conry stand outside their home in Paradise, Calif., which was almost untouched by November's deadly Camp Fire. Their property insurer notified them in December that it would not renew their policy past January.

Sound description: You can hear the influence of hip-hop on this sharp, lyrical vandal with an airy voice and street-smart beats. Addiquit is a songwriter and MC from Spring Valley. In 2003, she met beat-maker/producer Machinedrum while studying audio engineering at the Full Sail media-arts school in Florida.

The Ennis Lions (4-14, 1-1) have gotten off to a slow start during the first two district games this season and were unable to come back against the Mansfield Lake Ridge Eagles (8-5, 2-0) Friday. The Eagles flew past the Lions early in the game to claim a final 47-39 victory. Ennis’s home for the temporarily displaced needs more room to hold those in need. Ellis County unemployment filings dropped to 6 percent in November. Fire Marshal Gary Howell said children playing with matches likely caused a fire that damaged a home in the 700 block of South Carlton Street on Friday.
With every passing day, we get closer and closer to Disney and Lucasfilm finally announcing that they’ve found the actor who will play young Han Solo. Right now, all signs point to the relative newcomer Alden Ehrenreich. Deadline has sources who say that Ehrenreich’s in the lead after an “impressive performance.” If you’ve seen in him in Hail, Caesar! that will come as no surprise. Also no surprise? That no one at Disney or Ehrenreich’s agency was willing to comment to Deadline.
Tuesday morning a southbound A train veered into the wall of a subway, derailing two cars as it approached the 125th Street station. Hundreds of riders had to be evacuated from that train in the pitch-dark tunnel, and 34 people suffered non-life-threatening injuries. As for the rest of the subway system: Hundreds of other commuters had to be evacuated from stalled or stopped trains after the incident, and delays and service disruptions persisted throughout the day and well into the evening commute. Source tells me this issue with the spare rail looks like a case of "balancing service versus maintenance."

Gail Hutson, from Surbiton, who is totally paralysed down one side of her body and uses a power wheelchair rather than a manual chair, was told she had ‘the wrong kind of wheelchair’ for local taxis when she arrived at the station on Friday night. The 60-year-old said she was told that accessible taxis in Worthing do not have the right kind of ramp to support the heavier weight of power wheelchairs.
DENVER — No longer welcome on an NFL sideline, Colin Kaepernick turned to social media to make his point on the NFL's opening Sunday. In a tweet, Kaepernick gave a shout-out to "my brothers," Dolphins teammates Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson, who were the only two players in the league to take a knee during the national anthem during Sunday's early games. "They have not backed down, even when attacked and intimidated," Kaepernick said in the tweet, which was accompanied by a picture of the Dolphins kneeling before their game.
As free agency approaches, players around the league will be on the move as teams try to put themselves in the best possible position to compete for a championship. Superstar Kawhi Leonard recently stated disinterest with the San Antonio Spurs and would like to be traded. Leonard prefers playing with the Los Angeles Lakers but does not mind playing for the Los Angeles Clippers. Either way, he has made it very known to other teams that he will be going to Los Angeles by the summer of 2019. However that doesn’t stop other teams trying to get their hands on Leonard.
Even if you’re not at risk of dying, you can still get other people sick. The number of people who died from the flu in the 2017-2018 season. Estrada Anton // Shutterstock - Even if you will not die from flu, your actions affect others. It feels like up until a couple years ago, the accepted line about the flu shot was that you only needed it if you were a) young, b) old, or c) sick, and that maybe it didn’t work that well anyway because it only protects against certain (the most common) strains.
Deeper look at perhaps the most intriguing recommendation in Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce recent transit report. In South Nashville off Interstate 65, freight trains and trucks enter around the clock at the second-largest CSX rail yard and transfer facility in the Southeast. It’s known as Radnor Yard, and since the 1950s, trains have emptied containers, reloaded and reassembled at this spot, next to what is today Harding Place and Sidco Drive. The noisy, 517-acre industrial rail yard marks one of the most important crossroads for train giant CSX, which owns and operates rail in Nashville and much of the rail east of the Mississippi River.

The solution combines Apple's QuickTime tools for content creation, Sun's streaming server technology that sits on top of Solaris and Sun hardware, and Ericsson's network interface node that will allow operators to provision these services on their network.
A friend of the victim says Jews often pay protection money to locals but that this time the attackers did not want money, just blood. Schwartz added that the Jews who live in Uman are “well aware of the locals' character” and that they have solved numerous incidents of violence by paying money “so as not to raise the flames.” In this case, he said, there was no way of talking to the attackers, who had come to kill Jews and not for any other reason. "They did not take the wallet nor the cell phone," he noted.
Would weekend voting increase turnout? - The Morning Call Would weekend voting increase turnout? Would weekend voting increase turnout? About 18 percent of eligible Democratic and Republican voters cast ballots during last month’s primary election, according to unofficial returns, a slightly better turnout than the last midterm election. But it’s hardly a bellwether for citizen enthusiasm in the nation’s democratic electoral process. So, why haven’t droves of voters gone to the polls? Two Philadelphia-area Democratic lawmakers think they have part of the answer: It’s Tuesday’s fault.
Harp Gallery has grown in size and reputation in 30 years of selling refurbished antiques. TOWN OF MENASHA - Ken Melchert doesn't ascribe to the idea that "antique" should mean "untouchable." Furnishings were made for function, and the craftsmen of earlier eras — equipped with hand tools and determination — poured their sweat and skill into pieces they expected would long outlive them. Cars need maintenance, homes need work, and every 50 to 75 years, so too does the carved oak dining set or the mahogany china cabinet. There's pride in getting those works back into shape for new generations.
The new legislation will provide for compensation for homeowners in Mayo and Galway. THE PROJECT IS now long-delayed and much-maligned but homeowners could be set for compensation from the rural broadband project. New legislation has been brought to cabinet by Minister for Communications Denis Naughten that will allow the government access to private lands along routes in Galway and Mayo to lay down new broadband fibre cables. It will essentially mean a compulsory purchase order (CPO) can be used for sections of land without the owner’s consent. The government has used CPOs in the past to build other infrastructural projects such as motorways and the Luas works.
The Kansas City Chiefs announced on Tuesday that dates have been set for the club’s training camp at the University of Wisconsin – River Falls.

What is a dog worth? If a dog is killed through someone’s negligence, is the owner entitled to compensation for just the monetary value of the animal (usually not much) or also for the “sentimental value” that come from the owner’s emotional attachment to the pet? After all, family heirlooms–such as your grandfather’s watch or a piece of jewelry that has been handed down from generation to generation–can have a claimed value greater than the material cost. Why not a family pet? The Texas Supreme Court just ruled on this matter.
Inspired by the Latin word for “stranger”, Quidam is an urban, intensely introspective show that tells the story of a young girl, invisible in her own surroundings, who discovers unique characters in a world of seemingly ordinary passersby.

Michael Schumacher - a seven-time Formula One world champion is "not bedridden or living on tubes", it has been reported as new details about his recovery emerge. It's nearly five years (December 29, 2013) since the 50 year old hit his head on a rock while skiing with his then 14-year-old son Mick in Meribel in the French Alps. The multiple head injuries caused blood clots which were not entirely removed by doctors because of the extent of the injury.

The Governor of the Solomon Islands Central Bank, Rick Hou, says around ten million Solomon Islands dollars paid into a pyramid scheme could have been put to good use in the country. Mr Hou has gone on local radio to discourage people from giving more money to the Family Charitable Trust, a pyramid scheme promising million dollar returns on a 250 dollar investment. He says more than nine thousand people have signed up with the scheme with an average buy in of around a thousand dollars. Mr Hou went public at the weekend to warn people not to expect payouts in the scam.
CenSSA, things are finally getting back on track. Kemp has worked his magic and brought George Sands in for testing, as well as the Type 2 from Windsor Terrace, Annie Sawyer. Hennessey says she's powerful... Very powerful. Add to that our first werewolf, Nina Pickering, and it looks like things are going very well here. Kemp wants to perform an exorcism on Sawyer and get testing on George and Nina as soon as possible. My friends, we are entering the most exciting period of experimentation we have ever seen.
What appeared to be a harmless tackle of Dallas Cowboys’ running back Phillip Tanner in the fourth quarter Sunday became the last play Ravens inside linebacker Ray Lewis will make this season. Lewis, 37 years old and a veteran of 17 NFL seasons, now has to decide whether the Ravens’ victory Sunday will also be the final game of his Hall of Fame career. A magnetic resonance imaging test taken Monday on Lewis’ right arm revealed the Ravens’ worst fear: a torn triceps, which is a rare but significant injury that will likely require surgery and an arduous six-month recovery period.

Today is a big day for RIM, as they will be holding their press event at 8.00 am PDT, we recently wrote an article offering details of the live blogs for the event. We expected a lot of news and rumors to come up for the buildup to the event, but we were shocked to learn that Research IN Motion India were to allow their BlackBerry service to be monitored in the country. There has been a great deal of fear in India offer national security, so RIM thought that the perfect solution was to offer them the technical codes that they use for their corporate email services.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - A NATO patrol intercepted Russian fighter jets over the Baltic Sea, Lithuanian authorities said on Wednesday, as Moscow marks the anniversary of its takeover of Crimea with one of its largest military drills in years. The group of eight Su-27 and Su-34 fighter jets and three Russian military transports was intercepted over international waters on Tuesday, a Lithuanian Ministry of Defense spokeswoman said. “These were first Russian fighters intercepted by NATO’s Baltic air police this year,” Viktorija Cieminyte said, adding that the Russian pilots switched off their transponders to avoid commercial radar and did not talk to air traffic control.
MARCUS RASHFORD can handle the pressure of his England call-up, according to David James. The Manchester United star has had a remarkable breakout season at Old Trafford since his debut on February 25. Rashford penned a new deal with the Red Devils this week, keeping him at the club until 2020. And England hero James, who made 53 appearances for The Three Lions, claims the youngster deserves his call-up. "If you had asked me a month ago he wouldn't have been in the [England] Under 21s," James told the Daily Express.
Is one dead cat still contempt? The concept of contempt of court is easy: something like defiance of the dignity or direction of a court of law. The actual law that underpins it has been a trickier fish. The law of contempt is currently spread both across legislation and precedent and is increasingly out of touch with changing technology. In Parliament the former Attorney General Chris Finlayson’s Member’s Bill to update the law passed a first reading and will now go to Select Committee. It is also now likely to be picked up by the current Minister of Justice (Andrew Little) as Government Legislation.

Humanity at its worst sometimes breeds Hollywood at its best. War is, as they say, hell. But the subject makes for very good movies. From gritty thrillers that examine the psychological effects war has on humanity, to action-packed spectacles that boast heroic figures, to romances set against the conflicts of battle, Hollywood has often used war-ravaged settings to tell some of cinema's best stories. If you're feeling in the mood for battle, Netflix has plenty of war movies to offer. Here are the best war movies you can stream right now.
Handing them over to the Governor, he alleged that some conversations had "deep national security implications". One CD has already made nights restless for Amar Singh.

TORONTO – Joe Torre returned Raul Mondesi to the lineup last night against the Blue Jays after not starting him Thursday evening in Cleveland, where Mondesi was used as a pinch-hitter. No, Torre didn’t see anything special about Mondesi’s hacks Thursday night. He simply figured Mondesi has been the Yankees’ right fielder all year long and opted to play him over the lefty-swinging Karim Garcia against hittable right-hander John Wasdin. Mondesi relaxed enough to draw a bases-loaded walk that snapped a tie in the seventh inning and help the Yankees to an 8-5 victory in front of a SkyDome crowd of 27,652.
Today we are showing you the first excerpts of the film the Israel lobby does not want you to see. The news channel Al Jazeera sent undercover journalists into pro-Israeli government groups in the United States. Among several things, they uncovered closely-coordinated efforts by these groups and the Israeli government to monitor, smear, and intimidate U.S.-based defenders of Palestinian rights. The film is called The Lobby USA, but it has never been released. That’s because the Israeli government and the Israel lobby pressured Qatar to censor it. Qatar, which owns Al Jazeera, caved to that campaign, citing national security.

Men, it turned out, had a harder time committing to school, even when they desperately needed to retool. They tended to start out behind academically, and many felt intimidated by the schoolwork. They reported feeling isolated and were much worse at seeking out fellow students, study groups, or counselors to help them adjust. Mothers going back to school described themselves as good role models for their children. Fathers worried that they were abrogating their responsibilities as breadwinner. Among adults 25 and older, 10.6 million U.S. women have master's degrees or higher, compared to 10.5 million men.
A Cheektowaga town prosecutor who characterized Erie County District Attorney Frank A. Sedita III as “overzealous” in his prosecution of a former councilman has been stripped of her authority. Sedita revoked the authority of Kathleen M. McDonald to serve as a public prosecutor, effective immediately. In a letter to the editor published in Monday’s Buffalo News, McDonald wrote of her support for former Cheektowaga Council Member Charles Markel, who lost his seat on the Town Board when he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge related to unemployment insurance fraud. Sedita said that what McDonald wrote put her at odds with her role as a prosecutor.

MANAGUA, Nicaragua &ndash; The Sandinista government&acute;s much-hyped trial of what it calls &ldquo;the crime of the century&rdquo; started and stopped Monday afternoon under the careful watch of media and police, but without the star of the show. Opposition leader and former banker Eduardo Montealegre, who has been repeatedly singled out among the list of 39 people accused of orchestrating a $600 million banking bailout scheme known as the &ldquo;Cenis&rdquo; scandal, refused to answer his legal summons to appear before the judge Monday afternoon.
A prize show horse expected to compete in the Grand Prix this year met a gristly end this weekend when “professional” thieves stole him from his stall and carved him up in a nearby field leaving behind just a “ribcage, neck and head” for his owners to find. A broad issue that's arisen as an offshoot of the whole Jill Abramson-getting-fired discussion: Do successful people (in the media and elsewhere) get there mainly by luck, or by skill/ virtue/ drive/ other endearing quality? It is luck, of course. Never forget that it is mostly luck.

Now, the vampires of "Twilight" are left to sink their teeth into each other, as the Final Four round of MTV News' epic Twi-Fight Saga begins today. Despite fervent support from Kellan Lutz and Taylor Lautner, Bella's dad and everyone's favorite Forks sheriff, Charlie Swan, fell to daughter Bella in the Elite Eight.
Education chiefs had planned to merge primaries at Dunvegan, Edinbane, Knockbeck and Struan, and provide a new £8million building at Dunvegan to serve all four areas. The local communities fought the plans – and the independent Closure Review Panel agreed with them and blocked the closures. Council leaders appealed the decision, but yesterday Portree Sheriff James Tierney backed the panel’s decision and gave protection to the smaller schools. And as Skye families enjoyed the good news last night, it emerged the council still hopes to build the new community school.
LAKE PLACID — This was a go big or go home year for the Lake Placid Film Festival. Though it’s still too early to say exactly how well the event fared financially, Festival Director Gary Smith expects this year’s LPFF to be a success. Plenty of aspects changed leading up to the event, which is run by the Adirondack Film Society. Firstly, the name changed from forum to festival. The dates changed from summer to fall. A theme was added. There was a new logo. There was a new website. Thirty-eight people volunteered.
Anyone fearing for the long-term future of private insurers should talk to M. Ted Haynes, president of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma. You might say that state Supreme Court Justice Tom Colbert embraces history. You might also say he has now become part of it. David Box planned his first party during his senior year at the University of Oklahoma in Norman. What began as a raucous New Year’s Eve shindig in 1988 set the stage for the next 26 years in the entertainment and real estate industries. Janet Meshek chose engineering as a career more than 35 years ago.
Has there been a learning experience for Apple quite like the Apple Watch? Back when the original model launched in 2015, there was – not unfairly – a sense that Apple itself wasn’t quite sure what exactly it should do. Now, as the Apple Watch Series 4 arrives on wrists, it does so not only with a laser focus, but with the compelling hardware to match. 2018’s Apple Watches are more expensive. The Series 4 starts at $399 for the 40 mm and $429 for the 44 mm; if you want cellular, add another $100 on top.
Army players and coaches run onto the field after beating Navy 21-17 in Baltimore on Saturday. BALTIMORE >> Army ended a 14-year run of frustration against Navy, using an overpowering running game and opportunistic defense to carve out a long overdue 21-17 victory Saturday. With future commander in chief Donald Trump looking on, the Black Knights blew a 14-point lead before quarterback Ahmad Bradshaw scored on a 9-yard run with 6:42 left to give Army the win it had been waiting for since 2001. The Black Knights’ 14-game losing streak was the longest by either academy in a series that began in 1890.
Every parent has had that embarrassing experience — a mad, screaming, crying, or pouting child in a public place. Do you yell, threaten, ignore, or try to appease the child? Whatever you do, other people are looking. Dr. Diane Ross-Glazer has been there. She opens Parenting as a Second Language by telling the story of her daughter throwing a tantrum, and parents will be hooked from that page on. Dr. Ross-Glazer knows we can’t prevent our children from misbehaving in public, but we can lessen the damage by learning how to speak with them.

The study, which was known as ProTECT-III (Progesterone for Traumatic Brain Injury, Experimental Clinical Treatment), was conducted between April 2009 and October 2013. UC researchers enrolled 85 of the 882 patients enrolled nationally, making UCMC the highest enrolling hospital. In the study, eligible patients were randomized to receive progesterone or placebo within four hours of sustaining head injury, with most injuries received in automobile crashes. Patients were treated with progesterone or placebo for 96 hours and then closely followed by researchers for six months. Progesterone is a hormone that is associated with pregnancy but is also found in the brains of males and females.

Federal prosecutors in Nashville said in a press release Thursday that Eric Swarbrick has been charged with interstate stalking and sending interstate communications with the intent to threaten.

Invitations were going out last week for the Beacham Theater's annual Christmas Day dinner, but they weren't engraved and no RSVP was required. It's a good bet, though, that more than 1,000 eager diners will be waiting when the concert hall doors open at noon. Word travels fast on the street, and Orlando's homeless folks know a good thing when they see it. This dinner - it's the work of chef Arch Maynard, formerly of Villa Nova and now of Caruso's Palace - is a class act, and this is its fourth year.
I suppose people have a natural tendency to gamble. I even know some people who save money on the chance that it will turn out to be valuable someday. But I don”t recommend needless gambles at bridge. At today”s bold four spades, South ruffed the first heart and drew trumps. He next tried a club finesse with dummy”s queen. East took the king and returned a low diamond, and when South played low, West won and led a second club; he could easily suppose that East had the jack.
With Google pushing into retail and Amazon into advertising, where should you invest your ad budget? Contributor Andreas Reiffen says it depends on what you're selling and how much you have to invest. Talk in the digital advertising space has traditionally focused on Google and Facebook’s digital duopoly, each fighting for more of your advertising dollars. But for Google, the real competition is coming from elsewhere. Over the last few years, Google has pushed further and further into the retail space. Simultaneously, Amazon expanded its advertising platform. In the end, they both want the same thing: your purchase intent.
Dorothy's tornado was nothing compared to the giant swirlsof plasma that storm in outer space. Space tornadoes are funnels of hot charged particles aroundthe Earth that flow at more than a million mph (1.6 million kph). As the ionscircle, they produce strong electrical currents that help create the gorgeous light show known as theaurora. New observations of these cosmicstorms by a suite of NASA spacecraftcalled THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions duringSubstorms) help shed light on their inner workings. THEMIS found that spacetornadoes can produce electrical currents greater than 100,000 amperes (forcomparison, a 60-watt light bulb draws about half an ampere).
Watford captain Troy Deeney accepts that &apos;what will be will be&apos; in the transfer market, with Newcastle and West Brom eyeing up the Hornets&apos; skipper. Deeney is constantly linked with a move away from Vicarage Road and this transfer window has been no different. Reports last week suggested the Hornets were willing to sell the 29-year-old, although Marco Silva has played that down and labelled him an &apos;important player&apos;, with the Baggies and the Toon Army being credited with an interest.
Baylor softball dropped a midweek match to Stephen F. Austin 4-1 Tuesday at Getterman Stadium. After defeating the Jacks in 15 straight contests, it was the first time since 2003 that the Lady Bears lost a game to SFA. Junior utility player Goose McGlaun pitched six shutout innings, allowing nine hits but holding SFA’s hot offense to one run and threw 64 strikes out of 90 pitches. The Humble native has pitched very little since last season, but has had to step up since the loss of senior ace Gia Rodoni to injury.

Behrouz Boochani was recognised for reporting from detention at the Diaspora Symposium, which was staged at the Parliament of New South Wales. The judge said Mr Boochani was chosen despite criteria requiring the award to be given to Australian citizens. She said Mr Boochani was a citizen of the world, who's reports from detention with a small mobile phone and restricted internet access remind us of the possibilities for resistance.
Physicians And Healthcare Administrators: Friends Or Foes? We have a burnout problem in American medicine. Over 54% of physicians report a loss of enthusiasm for work, feelings of cynicism, and a low sense of personal accomplishment. The number is up 10% from just three years ago. Who is to blame? If you ask many physicians, the fault lies among leaders involved in healthcare finance, policy and clinical administration. Why don’t business people get us? Why are there so many administrators involved in the delivery of care now—when there were so few in the early days of my career?
New research shows cyanobacteria toxins can travel more than a mile inland, in sizes able to deeply penetrate human lungs. FGCU research released Friday shows airborne cyanobacteria toxins can travel more than a mile inland, raising questions about health consequences for those exposed to the region’s recent massive blue-green algae blooms last year. The blooms also affected the Treasure Coast. A bloom of microcystis aeruginosa began in Lake Okeechobee in early June and was carried into the waters of the St. Lucie River and Caloosahatchee River via discharges from the lake directed by the Army Corps of Engineers.
Barring any shocking development, Earl Thomas will be a Seattle Seahawk come Week 1 of the 2018 NFL season. ESPN's Adam Schefter reported on Saturday that Seattle does not plan to trade the veteran safety unless teams bring better offers to the table. Schefter noted the Seahawks are adamant that they will not give the six-time Pro Bowler away. True to his word, he held out during offseason workouts and the preseason. The 29-year-old even penned a letter for The Players' Tribune to explain his stance, expressing his desire to play while also making it clear the NFL is a business.
Virginia Tech brought winter with it on a cold, windy Friday night. The Hokies brought down the Longhorns, 1-0, ending their 2018 postseason. The No. 4 national seed Texas Longhorns will take on Virginia Tech at Mike A. Myers Stadium one last time this season to kick off the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The No. 18 Texas Longhorns finished their Big 12 campaign bowing out of the Big 12 Championship tournament after falling to No. 14 West Virginia once again on Friday night. By the end of the 110 minutes of play, it no longer mattered who was the better team.
CRESTVIEW � A woman who called lawmen about a domestic dispute apparently forgot or didn�t care about the marijuana, pipes and bongs in her house, sitting out in plain view of Okaloosa County Sheriff�s deputies and her young child. Needless to say, she was arrested. On Feb. 17 deputies were called to a Rosebud Avenue residence about a disturbance. When they walked into the house, they said they could smell a strong odor of marijuana. A glass pipe with narcotics residue was sitting on the kitchen counter. Lawmen asked the woman if they could search her home; she said yes.

Country singer-songwriter Chris Young is ready to hit the beach. The last few times he’s performed in Southern California, he’s had sold-out shows at Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa during the run of the annual OC Fair. Though he certainly appreciated the enthusiastic crowd, the farm animals and the scent of delicious fried fair food in the air, he said he’s looking forward to swapping all of that out for the sand and surf and getting to play with his band with a clear view of the Pacific Ocean.
The so-called mummy of a 15-year-old Incan girl sacrificed 500 years ago has a few secrets. The teenager suffered from a bacterial lung infection and was likely drugged at the time of her death. The girl was discovered in 1999 on the Argentinian volcano Llullaillaco, which is about 22,000 feet tall. The girl, referred to as the Llullaillaco Maiden, and her younger companions Llullaillaco Boy and Lightning Girl were likely given drugs, which played a role in their deaths. After they were sacrificed, the freezing mountain temperatures and other factors naturally preserved their bodies, scientists have said.
EDWARD Furlong shot to fame in 1991 when he played John Connor in Terminator 2. A teen heartthrob, the actor was a name on everyone's lips as he took over movie screens everywhere. The film star, now 39, has been spotted out and about in Los Angeles this week and people are shocked to see how different he looks. Almost completely unrecognisable, Edward sported long brown hair as he went shopping with girlfriend Monica Keena. The Green Hornet star wore a fade Coco-Cola t-shirt – which appeared to be on inside out – which he paired with flared ripped jeans and black boots.
When you parse his Inaugural address — and watch the unmistakable prominence and power of deeper-thinking nationalists like chief strategist Steve Bannon, policy guru Stephen Miller and Attorney General-in-waiting Jeff Sessions — you see a Trump form of nationalism emerging. What Trump believes: According to advisers, Trump's core beliefs boil down to pro-America, pro-U.S. jobs, pro-strong-borders. One of those advisers told us that while Trump might not think much about philosophy or specifics, he's the perfect vehicle to carry their ideas because he has an intuitive sense of how to sell them, especially to the white working class.

June 11 (Reuters) - Venezuelan PDVSA’s U.S. refining unit Citgo Petroleum is increasing efforts to buy crude on the open market to compensate for declining supplies from its parent, which is dealing with a severe tanker backlog that has raised the prospect of a force majeure declaration, traders said on Monday.

It looks like an official announcement welcoming JUCO Dre Mathieu to the Minnesota hoops family is just around the corner. He would be new Gophers coach Richard Pitino's second recruit for the 2013-14 season. Daquein McNeil signed with MInnesota two weeks ago. The 5-11 Mathieu, who visited the Minneapolis campus last weekend, said on Monday via text message that he would be making his decision on Tuesday -- choosing between Minnesota, Ole Miss and Pepperdine, his last three schools after eliminating Memphis. A teammate at Central Arizona, Calvin Bonner, tweeted late Tuesday morning that Mathieu had chosen the Gophers.
TAMPA, Fla. — Marc Betourney had been working in finance for six years before having a change of heart and doing what many people dream of: quitting. Marc said he had his letter of resignation all typed up and ready to go. What was next was even more beer, but instead of just drinking it, he and his wife Meghan had a different idea.

APATZINGAN, Mexico — Federal forces struggled to bring order to western Mexico Wednesday as vigilantes battled a vicious drug cartel that apparently tried to reassert its authority by burning a downtown pharmacy to enforce its orders that no businesses should open. The fire attack came just two blocks from the Apatzingan city center where, the day before, dozens of federal police had paraded in an impressive display of force meant to re-impose order in a region where heavily armed vigilantes have taken up a freelance fight against the drug gang. An employee of the pharmacy said two men pulled up with jerry cans of gasoline and began dousing the store and its merchandise.
Iris Marie Bloom of Protecting Our Waters at a protest in Philadelphia against the Mariner East pipeline which would transport natural gas liquids over 300 miles across Pennsylvania. Construction is scheduled to begin this month on a pipeline that will connect a refinery outside Philadelphia to the “wet gas” boom in southwestern Pennsylvania. The liquids are currently being hauled by truck and rail to the Marcus Hook refinery, which has begun ramping up operations after closing its doors in early 2012. By contrast, pipelines are considered to be a safer, more efficient mode of transport for hazardous materials, but they still require caution.
If you’ve lived in Anchorage for any amount of time, you’ve likely enjoyed biking, hiking, or cross country skiing on one of the area’s many trails. Three of the people responsible for bringing those trails to Anchorage are Jim Burkholder, Richard Mize, and Lin Hinderman. The trio are all former cross country ski coaches in Anchorage, and members of the Alaska Cross Country Ski Hall of Fame. When Mize and Burkholder arrived in Anchorage in the 1950s, the only place with groomed ski trails was Arctic Valley.

Fuchsia Dunlop's Sichuanese green soy bean salad, a delicious appetiser. In the West, young soy beans are most often encountered in their pods, with the Japanese name edamame. Although the Chinese eat them this way too, they also like to serve the podded beans as an appetiser, sometimes just with a little red pickled chilli for colour, sometimes mixed with preserved mustard greens and other ingredients as in this recipe. Leave out the preserved vegetable if you don’t have it to hand. Bring a panful of water to the boil, add salt, then the soy beans.

LeBron James called out his team’s complacency after a loss at Detroit. Even when San Antonio makes changes to the roster the results remain the same – a lot of wins. Zaza Pachulia over DeAndre Jordan? The Mavs will take that right now. Jimmy Butler is the Bulls’ best player and he came up big late in a win at Phoenix on Wednesday. Look for Atlanta to find its stride once Jeff Teague is healthy. Roster has a nice mix of veteran leadership to go with some promising young talent. Andre Drummond is still rebounding at an insane rate.

Just sitting, and watching and waiting. Calmly. "I had confidence in myself, but when I saw him sitting there, I knew I was going to make them," Middleton said. Hatcher was there for Middleton when at 8 years old, his parents split. He's no longer with Middleton's mother, but the step-dad and step-son seemed to have a bond Thursday night. As easily as Hatcher watched, Middleton's sleepy eyes showed no trace of nerves despite taking shots that could have, simply put, torpedoed a season if he missed.
The integration-software innovator delivered another impressive quarter, along with a surprise long-term outlook.

Hughes, a 21-year-old right-hander, hasnât talked with team officials in Tampa about the trade possibility since his named surfaced in talks in November. Hughes is focused on the one thing he can control: preparing for the 2008 season. He started a throwing program four weeks ago. Two other pitching prospects, Humberto Sanchez and Andrew Brackman, are taking part in throwing programs after elbow ligament replacement surgery last year. Sanchez, one of three pitchers obtained from Detroit for outfielder Gary Sheffield, expects to throw off a mound by late next month.
STAFFORD – Two-time defending Street Stock champion Johnny Walker has only run five races this season at Stafford Motor Speedway.

Craig Carney did go close for the visitors as they made a solid enough start but after seeing a header saved by Josh Powell in the City goal, Brodie opened the scoring on the quarter hour.
One of the 520 people laid off by Zynga took to Reddit to answer readers’ questions in a IAmA interviewthis week. Their major issues are the inability to adjust to the changing market. They did great when Facebook gaming was on the rise, but now it’s declining and Mobile is on the rise. They’re trying to change over, but employ too many of the same game development “best practices” that were developed for Facebook games. These just don’t translate to the mobile market, which is why they’re suffering in that market.
Nissan's crossovers aren't exactly the most exciting cars in the world. That's okay though, because it looks like Nissan just figured out how to make up for the lack of thrill: Snow tracks. In this video you'll find Nissan's crossover/SUV range — the Rogue, Murano, and the Pathfinder — equipped with specially designed snow tracks, unique Matte Red body wraps, and some pretty much run of the mill roof racks. For some reason, the way these things crawl up and down these snow banks is just so pleasing to watch.
Scott Morrison will kick off a four-day Queensland electoral sortie with a pledge to oversee the creation of 1.25m jobs over the next five years, as he attempts to claw back support for the Coalition ahead of the 2019 election. But the government will be hit with a fresh political challenge as it attempts to steady its fortunes ahead of the election, with another high-profile independent, Oliver Yates, the former chief executive of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, preparing to run against the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in the Melbourne seat of Kooyong.

I thought Katie McWilliams really set the tone for us today, and she showed her leadership.
Forest defenders: Ed Hill, Fiona York and Kristin Godby from Goongerah Environment Centre. The Andrews government has spent years investigating claims of unlawful logging against its state-owned timber company without enforcing any penalties. Documents reveal Victoria's environment department is currently probing 27 alleged forest breaches against VicForests, reported by the community between January 2016 and December 2017 - including multiple claims involving rainforests, where timber harvesting is prohibited. At least four of those cases relate to coupes in East Gippsland, where logging activities allegedly took place in or around rainforest areas without establishing protective buffers that are required under the Code of Practice for Timber Production.

She moves from place to place to place. We were told to stay out of her (expletive) life. Our bleeding hearts will never stop loving her. It’s like a death in the family. She still walks around, but that’s not our little girl, she’s that guy’s girlfriend. Elements pointing to the possibility that your daughter is taking drugs are: Isolating herself from you, leaving her job, losing her possessions and burning through money. Don’t give up on her.

Leading Internet companies including Google, Ebay, IAC, Microsoft, Yahoo and Amazon issued a letter sharply critical of a House bill that would hamstring the FCC from implementing net neutrality regulations, the Washington Post reports. The bill, championed by House Commerce Committee Chairman Joe Barton (R-Tex. ), would allow the FCC to decide disputes about Web access only case by case and would bar the agency from writing detailed rules on the subject.
Will 2016 Be Altria Group's Best Year Yet? Even with its long history, this year could be a turning point for the tobacco giant. In the stock market's history, Altria Group (NYSE:MO) holds a key place. Even among the many long-lived companies whose shares trade publicly, Altria Group stands out for its long track record of rising share prices and ample dividend income. Yet there's one key reason why 2016 could be a breakout year for Altria, and it doesn't have anything to do with tobacco.

As per news reports published by internetnews on December 23, 2008, security provider ESET has isolated a new virus namely W32/Waledac. It is also learnt that ESET regards this virus as much more dangerous than the infamous Storm worm that had ruled the world of botnets for almost two years. Moreover, ever since the Storm botnet subsided, a new continuum of social engineering through e-mails has been using vacation themes to get users to view e-greeting cards, or making them read other Christmas themed content, according to experts at the security firm ESET.
The theory: In 1997, Bryan Hance, a student at the University of Arizona, began to investigate cryptic ads that run every year on 1 May in the student newspaper, The Daily Wildcat. After a bit of research, he found out the ads go back as far as 1981, potentially further. It's still going on today, and you can see the 2016 May Day ad here. The theory is that the ads are communication between a group of intellectuals, and Hance believes the ads contain meeting dates, past and future, for a secret society that is planning for an economic and political revolution.

NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has just found the most distant lensing galaxy (which are massive enough to act as their own intergalactic microscopes) ever. And thanks to a rare alignment, it might just give us a peak at how our very own galaxy formed all those billions of years ago. When you look more than 9 billion years ago in the early universe, you don't expect to find this type of galaxy lensing at all. It's very difficult to see an alignment between two galaxies in the early universe. Imagine holding a magnifying glass close to you and then moving it much farther away.
John Malone will retire from the Charter Communications board of directors, but continue to serve as a director emeritus. The 77-year-old Malone said in a statement that he resigned from the board in order to reduce travel and focus on fewer board positions. “I remain heavily invested in Charter, both financially and emotionally, and am excited about its prospects,” Malone said in the statement. The company nominated SiriusXM CEO Jim Meyer to fill the vacancy. The news comes a week after Malone announced he was stepping down from the Lionsgate board. It’s hard to envision the executive slowing down.
Ford wants to crack the world's largest auto market with fully electric vehicles sold under a new brand. The company announced plans on Tuesday to form a new joint venture with Anhui Zotye Automobile Co., a Chinese brand that specializes in all-electric vehicles. Ford and Zotye are exploring a 50:50 partnership to produce a line of electric vehicles. Ford (F) said the cars would be sold under a new brand, but did not offer additional details. The move coincides with a major push for more electric cars by the Chinese government, which is trying to reduce pollution in major cities.
Trouble came freaky fast for some workers at a Jimmy John's restaurant in Florida this week. According to WJXT-TV , a group of employees was fired from the Jimmy John's location at River City Marketplace in Jacksonville after Snapchat videos surfaced of them playing with food ingredients. One of the videos shows a worker jumping rope with a long strand of bread dough. Another video shows a female employee wearing a belt made of dough as another person narrates as if she were putting on a fashion show. Officials told WJXT that the dough used in the videos was immediately thrown out.
The European Union took a big step towards creating a single Europe-wide patent system on Friday (4 December), a move that is expected to save businesses many millions in annual costs. As part of the deal, industry ministers meeting in Brussels reached a political agreement on the setting up of a single EU-patent to replace the multitude of national patents that innovators are currently forced to acquire to protect their products. The ministers also reached a deal on the establishment of a EU patent court system that would see the setting up of a single European appeals courts for patent infringement disputes.

Pages can now join Groups on Facebook. Your Facebook Page can now join members-only Facebook Groups. In a new setting update spotted by social media aficionado Matt Navarra, Facebook is now going to let Pages on the site interact with communities through Facebook Groups. Within Facebook Group settings, a new option has popped up for group owners that enables them to “allow Pages to request to join as group members.” Previously, only personal profiles could join Facebook Groups and post and comment within them. As Facebook points out, there are a number of Facebook Page types that really stand to benefit from this change.
Vale will continue to invest in Canada despite bad market conditions and low nickel prices because of the strength of its assets, and those assets aren’t just its ore bodies and its operations, said Peter Poppinga. Vale officially opened its newest Sudbury operation Friday, the $760-million Totten Mine, a nickel and copper producer. Totten is state of the art, fully automated, has an outstanding safety record and excellent environmental standards. "But Totten for us actually means much more," said Poppinga, president and chief executive officer of Vale Canada, and executive director of Vale Base Metals and Information Technology for Vale SA.

America’s recent history with steel tariffs is not great. The last time a U.S. president imposed sweeping steel tariffs on American trade partners was in 2002, when George W. Bush introduced a complex package of restrictions that triggered a wave of retaliatory import taxes from the European Union. Here’s how things played out, in light of President Donald Trump lifting the exemptions for Canada, Mexico and the European Union on his 25 per cent steel and 10 per cent aluminum tariffs Thursday. Bush’s steel tariffs took effect on March 20, 2002.

Facebook Settles With Lamebook – Lamebook, a humor site publishing funny Facebook posts, and Facebook settled this week. The judge refused to move the suit to California, and thus, some speculate that Facebook settled to avoid jury sympathy for the Austin-based company. Facebook Pays $40,000 in Bounty Program – Facebook’s Bug Bounty program has, thus far, paid out $40,000 to people around the world who have reported issues to the company. Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan wrote a blog about the program this week with more information.
Code 417: brandishing a gun near Tanglewood by Santa Maria. The suspect is a Hispanic Male Adult (HMA) in a white Kia seen punching a woman in the head in the vehicle, the woman was screaming. A young man approached the vehicle and confronted the abuser who pulled a gun on him. It helps me to remember that we are ALL members of the same human family, and are lovingly encouraged by our Creator to show as much love and respect to each other as we can. Even as our actions may be horrific at times, the truth remains that we are all of equal value and worth.
BARNSTABLE — Pierce the Goose is still receiving medical care after being saved from Cook Pond last week with an arrow through its chest, including treatment for lead poisoning. The Cape Wildlife Center, the nonprofit wildlife hospital that is treating the injured Canada goose, posted an update to its Facebook page Wednesday regarding the condition of the bird, dubbed Pierce. He was spotted in late March with an arrow piercing his breast, and was rescued last week. “'Pierce' the Canada Goose continues to recover after emergency surgery to remove an arrow from his chest.
This dissertation presents a method to improve automatic target recognition by utilizing bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations to augment a monostatic SAR observation of the same target with a single, stationary transmitter for improved automatic target recognition (ATR). We investigate the information gain of bistatic perspectives with respect to a monostatic perspective by calculating the correlation coefficient between the monostatic image of a target and the bistatic image of a target for increasing bistatic angles and find a significant information gain as the bistatic angle is increased. Following our information content analysis, we implement decision-level fusion of multiple aspects using majority voting and template matching.
New York's Sen. Schumer has appeared in our pages as Charles 30 times and Chuck 15 times in a three-month period. What should it be? We go with the person's preference, and in the case of Congress people, we try to use the official online Congressional Directory at www.Congress.org, which lists Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.). Never mind that his recent book "Positively American" is by Chuck Schumer. Boeing Co.'s chairman and chief executive officer has let it be known that he prefers to be called Jim McNerney, rather than his formal name W. James McNerney.
On a warm Saturday in June, accompanied by Ruvane Tide Shapiro, age 2 and ¾, the youngest of my eight grandchildren, I took a field trip to Coney Island. It was the day of the 2010 Mermaid Parade, but the idea was to visit the Coney Island Aquarium and the boardwalk and tour the new Luna Park rides and amusement center, escaping before the crowds arrived and the parade officially began at 2 p.m.
All did not go as planned. Ruvane, who was given the middle name Tide by his surfing-loving parents, found the turtles and the sharks and the big fish in the aquarium to be scary.
A large number of bodies, many of them women and children, are still buried under the rubble in Mosul after the months-long operation to retake the city. RT’s Murad Gazdiev saw the gruesome aftermath of the battle declared a major success by the US-led coalition. Multiple corpses of suspected Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) militants – but also civilians – are still lying under the rubble in the sweltering August heat. Rescuers are working to retrieve corpses buried under collapsed houses, with many buildings literally reduced to ashes – possibly in the aftermath of bombings or artillery strikes.

The acclimation process that employees of a large manufacturing company underwent after the introduction of video display terminals (VDTs) to the workplace was studied. In an attempt to understand the acclimation process, employees' mood states, perceptions of the work setting and their reactions toward the VDTs were assessed. This study followed secretaries (N = 11) through the initial phases of converting from a traditional to an automated office. The subjects were observed four weeks prior to and eight weeks after the introduction of VDTs. The secretaries' stress levels were monitored by the Profile of Mood States.
NEW RESEARCH FROM the University of Adelaide in Australia has shown for the first time that the growth of brain tumours can be halted by a drug currently being used to help patients recovering from the side effects of chemotherapy. The discovery has been made during a study looking at the relationship between brain tumors and a peptide associated with inflammation in the brain, called “substance P”. Commenting on the research today, Dr Elizabeth Harford-Wright of the university’s Centre for Neuroscience Research said researchers have known for some time that levels of the substance are also greatly increased in different tumours around the body.

Did consumers get a hangover in April after a spending binge in March? Not by a long shot. March and April sure look a lot different than January and February. Most economic indicators have perked up in the early spring and that’s no surprise: the weather is a lot better. And a bevy of reports on Thursday is expected to underscore the “spring snapback” theme. If the weather has been holding back the U.S. economy, we should get some concrete evidence on Tuesday. A key manufacturing index is forecast to rise slightly in March and auto sales are also expected to bounce back.
Bands From Different Lands: Survay Says! Aug. 27, 2014 — Brother’s Henry and D. Jay Menzel are the heart and soul of Blairstown, N.J., based ska/punk band Survay Says!. While other musicians in the group seem to be playing a game of musical chairs, Henry on the guitar and vocals and D. Jay on the trombone and vocals have been stalwart fixtures in the Survay Says! lineup, and it’s obvious they are doing something right. The group has toured with big-time ska bands like Big D. and the Kids Table, Reel Big Fish, and Less Than Jake.
Awedding present from one's mother can mean any number of things. A coffeemaker or microwave is practical; a family silver service is sentimental, a luxury. When Cindy, the central figure of Cherry L.F. Johnson's "Half Moon Pocosin," marries J.D. in 1933 in rural North Carolina, she receives a black iron frying pan. "You better take this," her mother tells her. "You'll be needing it. A hard-working boy like J.D. has got to eat." As Cindy soon learns, "There wasn't a day that came that she didn't use that pan."
The singer's new album drops next week. Jhene Aiko and Childish Gambino have collaborated a few times in the past, sharing tracks like "Bed Peace" and "Pink Toes." And on Tuesday (September 2), they were at it again, with Donald Glover directing the visuals to the singer's "The Pressure." Falling in line with the title and the song's lyrics, the video reflects some of the pressures that Jhene feels in both her personal and professional life, with shots of her both at home with her daughter and all dressed up at a red carpet event.

Jaguars offense poised to become one of NFL's best? Published: Feb. 18, 2016 at 08:48 p.m. Updated: Feb. 18, 2016 at 09:17 p.m. If not for the their 31st-ranked defense, we would be hearing a lot more about the Jaguars as an up-and-coming playoff hopeful in a wide open AFC South. Blake Bortles and Allen Robinson led a breakout offense that scored 376 points, the second-most by any Jacksonville squad this century. Among the Jaguars' 11 losses were games in which they scored 25, 27, 31 and 39 points.

“You can’t make this up sometimes,” responded Ryan, in part. He left the podium after riffing on the importance of “government by consent” and advising the press corps to call their fathers this weekend. Point made: Ryan isn’t blacklisting The Post or any other media outlets. Since Trump clinched his status as presumptive nominee, his relationship with the House speaker has seesawed. For weeks, Ryan held off on endorsing Trump, only to declare that he’d vote for the longtime real-estate mogul.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. – Two prominent Broward organizations are collaborating to provide workforce training and create jobs. Broward College and the Urban League of Broward County were awarded $3,187,500, the largest amount ever awarded for a single project, by the Florida Job Growth Grant Fund for its Building the CORE (Critical Occupation Response through Education) program.

Black History Month is reasonably well-established in language arts and social studies curricula. Come February, English teachers pull out poems by Phyllis Wheatley, Langston Hughes, and Maya Angelou; history teachers take on the civil rights movement or abolition. In other subjects, however, Black History Month tends to be overlooked—but that doesn't mean it has to be. Given the underrepresentation of minorities, particularly black students, in STEM fields, an increased focus on black scientists and mathematicians could have a huge impact. On Scientific American, biologist Danielle Lee writes, "Put simply, members of under-represented communities want to see themselves in these roles.
Stampd designer Chris Stamp's Spänst collection launches in May. I am not currently in possession of a perfectly manicured loft with clean concrete surfaces, high ceilings, huge windows, and an expertly curated collection of art and ephemera scattered throughout. But I'd like to be. And while current circumstances dictate that such a thing won't be happening anytime soon, at least I—and you!—can channel some of that vibe with the new collaboration between Stampd designer Chris Stamp, graphic designer Maja Ganszyniec, and Ikea. The Spänst collection is basically what happens when a streetwear mentality meets interior design.
Accessibility is not only about hardware. Software, such as Internet page design, should also be designed in a way to maximise the experience for the vision impaired. commentary Accessibility is not only about hardware. Software, such as Internet page design, should also be designed in a way to maximise the experience for the vision impaired. I know I have talked about accessibility before, but I only focused on the topic of assessing hardware accessibility such as "is a photocopier keypad and display aligned so that a wheelchair bound operator can easily view and operate the product?"
Starting when Carl Fredericksen attached those bright balloons to the sky and floated off to Paradise Falls in Up, Pixar movies have used 3D excellently. In a way they were always built for it, with their animated heroes and bright colors and willingness to bound through space, but the studio famous for its perfectionists seemed to take to the 3D format especially well, even when so,so many other movies out there were simply slapping on the 3D surcharge and calling it a day (we've written about lots of those over the years of this column, you may remember).
African Union mediators have set another ultimatum in the Darfur conflict, with no sign that the two recalcitrant rebel factions are going to sign the Abuja deal. In what is fast turning into a war of ultimatums, the AU mediators and their international backers have decided to bulldoze through the Darfur peace process against apparent foot-dragging by the parties. A series of deadlines was put last month for the parties concerned to sign the peace proposals drawn up by the AU. When the government agreed to sign by the first deadline of April 30, pressure was shifted in the direction of the rebels.
With all the confusion and speculation on whether or not Madrid Fusion Manila 2018 will push through, I had lunch with actor Cesar Montano to get a categorical answer. You read that right—not Tourism Secretary Wanda Teo, but Tourism and Promotions Board head Cesar Montano because the gargantuan task of handling this gargantuan gastronomic event has fallen on his lap. So is it pushing through? According to Montano himself, the answer is a no. Madrid Fusion Manila 2018 is no longer pushing through. For a while, people thought this could not be the case because the government is bound by a contract.
Houstonian Rick Noriega is an old-fashioned Texas Democrat with the right voice for these new times. Come January, the halls of Congress will likely be populated by strengthened Democratic majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Texas will need able representation in all arenas in that shifting legislative environment. It will be especially important for Texans to have a strong, respected voice inside the expected Democratic majority in the Senate. Rick Noriega offers such a voice, with a distinctive Lone Star tone and perspective. The Chronicle endorses Noriega for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Republican John Cornyn.
Think you have ten minutes to make a first impression? The first seven seconds in which you meet somebody, according to science, is when you'll make a "first impression." So, whether it's for an event, a business development meeting, or any other professional setting, you have to act very quickly in order to make the proper first impression. Facial expressions are very important when it comes to making a good first impression. Who doesn't want their personal brand to be associated with positivity? Smiling's at the start of this list for a good reason.
Parliament, police and even Facebook are dealing with comments made by extremists of the ĽSNS party. Issues of the 20th meeting of parliament’s education committee that took place on April 27 did not attract many journalists, as MPs were supposed to discuss partial legislative changes and evaluations. But it turned out to be one of the most exciting committee meetings ever. Police officers interrupted the meeting in pursuit of Stanislav Mizík, an MP for the extremist party of Marian Kotleba. They requested his cooperation, then walked to Mizík’s office to search it. The police also charged him with extremist crimes.
We may be 20 years removed from the 1980s, but that hasn’t stopped the nostalgia train from making stops at all of your childhood favorites. “G.I. Joe”? Check. “Transformers”? Check. Lite Brite? OK, there’s no Lite Brite movie, but as we’re just days away from the release of the “A-Team” film, which is based on the popular TV series of the mid-80s, perhaps it’s time to take a look at the iTunes App Store’s collection of A-Team iPhone apps.
It's unseasonably cold in New York right now — 43 degrees Fahrenheit in Manhattan, with a high of 51 expected later in the day. That's about 8 degrees below average for October 26. And sleet, snow, and possibly freezing rain are on the way. That's according to a National Weather Service (NEWS) report released Wednesday morning. The frozen precipitation, headed down from Canada, should affect the Lower Hudson Valley and northeastern New Jersey. New York City can expect some cold rain but should miss any snowfall. The snow shouldn't be too bad anywhere or accumulate heavily.

Alaafin, who berated past administrations in the local government for their insensitivity to the wellbeing of the people, said his son’s endorsement for the federal legislative seat was in tandem with voice of the people in the constituency.
TORONTO, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Canada’s currency pared some of its overnight losses while shares of energy producers and gold miners pushed its stock market up 1 percent as investors saw a Donald Trump presidency favoring the oil sector and potentially stoking inflation. Some financial players also talked about increased prospects of a Bank of Canada rate cut to underpin growth which might be threatened by Trump’s stance on trade, though the implied probability of near-term move held around 27 percent. Energy stocks jumped 2.1 percent as bets that Trump might revive the Keystone XL pipeline boosted TransCanada Corp and the broader oil sands industry.
TRENTON — In his first television interview since the George Washington Bridge scandal erupted, Gov. Chris Christie today continued to blame former aides for last year's controversial lane closures, saying what they did was "inexplicably stupid." "When things were first reported, I said: 'This can't possibly be true.' Because who would do something like that?" the Republican governor told ABC News' Diane Sawyer in the first half of a two-part interview at his Morris County home. Sawyer asked Christie if having staff members act under his nose without his knowledge made him feel clueless.
Alabama Shakes‘ frontwoman Brittany Howard has spoken about how her life has changed since her band have become more well known.

I’d like to be able to tell you that life for the Shakes is no different from what it was a little while back, that the only change is people know the words to our songs now and so can sing along.
Paul Pogba's struggles at Manchester United were all the fault of Jose Mourinho, according to the midfielder's brother. Mathias Pogba has lifted the lid on the relationship behind the scenes by claiming the former manager's ego dominated the dressing room. "It was Mourinho who was the problem," Mathias Pogba told RMC Sport. "Mourinho still wants to be the centre of attention. The problem was Mourinho, right down the line. "In the locker room, outside the locker room...everything, I know my brother, and you tell him, 'Go.
There’s no doubt about it. Jared Padalecki and his wife, Genevieve, are pretty much the most adorable couple out there — and now that they just had their third baby, the cuteness is expanding. Little Odette Elliott was born on March 17, and we just can’t get over how precious her first public pic with her mom is. Supernatural die-hards are already well acquainted with Genevieve, but for those who haven’t watched the whole series, she’s still something of a mystery. Here are some things to know about her.
Thailand's army declared martial law today, in a move that looks a lot like a coup but that the army says is not a coup. Following months of protests, the country's prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra and some members of her cabinet were ordered to step down on May 7. Niwatthamrong Boonsongphaisan is currently the country's acting prime minister, but protestors aren't happy with him. He's refusing to resign, and the Senate -- the only legislative body remaining in the country after Yingluck dissolved the Parliament in December -- will only appoint a new interim prime minister if the current one steps down.
New research has discovered what one researcher labelled an “accounting error” in the current calculations of how much carbon is absorbed by continents. According to the new research to be published in the journal Science, the amount of greenhouse gas currently taken in by forests and other carbon sinks is less than has previously been assumed, thanks to the failure to calculate the methane emissions from freshwater areas. The new research studied methane fluxes from 474 freshwater areas and found that the methane release changes the total amount of greenhouse gasses absorbed by natural continental environments – the most obvious being the forest – by at least 25 percent.
NEW YORK Active International said today it has hired Eric Larsen as chief operating officer. He replaces Frederick Feust, who the Pearl River, N.Y.-based corporate trading company has shifted to the newly created role of president of Active’s international division. The company buys media time for clients, who pay for it with a combination of cash and underperforming assets. Last year the company placed an estimated $1.1 billion in ads for its clients. Larsen is a 25-year veteran marketing executive who served as a vice president and later president for North American operations of WPP Group’s Wunderman direct marketing agency from 1999 to 2000.
Ancient Chinese secret, huh? A Tibetan monk (force-of-nature Chow Yun-Fat: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) charged with protecting a scroll with deadly powers takes on a streetwise pickpocket (appealing doofus Seann William Scott: Evolution) as his apprentice on the same day the ex-Nazi (a scenery-chewing Karel Roden: 15 Minutes) who needs the scroll to take over the world catches up with him. And you thought you had a tough day at the office. Gloriously, exuberantly silly, this chop suey of fortune-cookie philosophy and acrobatic martial arts not only respects its comic-book roots but celebrates them with outlandish abandon.
Crate & Barrel found a way to increase its Web sales conversion rate by 44 percent—and it wasn't through the meticulous, oft-employed procedure that e-retail wonks call multivariate testing. Instead, the home-decor retailer recently observed shopping habits in stores and applied those findings to its e-commerce site. The site boosted its revenue per visitor by 128 percent. And it achieved a 37 percent higher average order value. The Northbrook, Ill.-based chain wouldn't divulge specifics about its methodology or formally comment about what it's achieved, but we asked a couple of digital marketers for their takes on the intriguing case study.

Ask Tom: How does the weather affect fall's colors? Well-timed rains and moderate summer temperatures have the Chicago area headed for an impressive display of fall colors. Barring unexpected changes in the weather over the next two months, vivid displays are likely in all but the northernmost sections of the Midwest, where severe drought may lead to less intense colors while encouraging leaves to fall from trees earlier than usual. These are the views of two of this area's most respected plant scientists and veteran observers of the region's fall color scene.

You say "statement win," our response is that there is no such thing in the NFL this year. The Chiefs provided us with the latest example that we're right about this. Kansas City was God-awful during Sunday's 31-3 shellacking at home to the previously winless Dolphins. But just six days earlier on their home field, the Chiefs had experienced a supposed season-defining "statement win" over AFC West-rival San Diego that vaulted them into first place. Then Matt Moore shreds Kansas City's defense?

It comes less than a month before Gavin Newsom will be sworn in as California’s 40th governor. “He may not have gotten to see Gavin sworn in.

I know, it’s way too early to speculate about the next presidential cycle, especially given our president’s age. We don’t even know, at this point, whether he will seek re-election. But at Townhall, Kevin McCullough is undeterred. He offers five reasons why Trump will sweep to re-election in 2020, carrying 40 states. McCullough’s reasons are cogent: foreign policy dominance, stronger armed forces yielding a safer world, the strongest hold on his base in recent years, and the administration’s remarkable record on jobs.
2016 has been a critical year for EU trade policy, with long and laborious negotiations with a number of international partners. While moving forward on CETA and TTIP with its North-American partners, the EU and China are negotiating a bilateral investment treaty. Other trade agreements are in the making with Japan, Australia and New Zealand. With 30 million jobs depending on exports outside the EU and the new Trade for All strategy proposed by the European Commission, EU trade policy has today reached a critical crossroads, also because of fierce criticism against these new generation agreements. In which direction will it go?
Russian President Vladimir Putin assured U.S. President Donald Trump in Helsinki on July 16 that Russia will not cut Ukraine out of a lucrative gas transit deal once its contentious Nord Stream 2 pipeline is complete. The two leaders met one-on-one for nearly two hours on July 16. Putin told reporters that Trump brought up Nord Stream 2 during the meeting. The project, which is under construction, is an expansion of the world’s longest undersea pipeline, which links Russia and Germany. Despite positioning itself as a neutral business venture, Nord Stream 2 has become an intensely political project.

The Tampa Bay Lightning are dead. After finishing the regular season with a record-tying 62 wins, the Tampa Bay Lightning exited the playoff picture with barely a whimper. One of the most dominant teams of the modern era was swept -- and swept pretty handily -- by a franchise that had never previously won a playoff series in it's nearly 20-year existence. There's no question that it's one of the most stunning upsets in recent NHL memory, but also arguably in recent sports memory...period. So how the hell did it happen? Let's break down where things went oh so wrong for Tampa Bay.

JOSE MOURINHO has accused Newcastle of raising their game when they play Chelsea, and only playing like they were negating in “friendlies” against other teams. The Chelsea boss takes his team to St James’ Park tomorrow having never beaten Newcastle at home in the league during his time in English football. Last season Chelsea crashed 2-0 against the Magpies and Mourinho wielded the axe as Ashley Cole was dropped after his team had 30 shots on goal but still lost.

As you might expect, Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh is not thrilled with the salacious news surrounding wide receiver Jacoby Jones. TMZ reported Monday the wide receiver was "bleeding everywhere" after a stripper named Sweet Pea struck him in the head with a large bottle of champagne early Monday morning. According to the gossip site, the incident occurred aboard a party bus in Washington, D.C., on the occasion of teammate Bryant McKinnie's 34th birthday. Police responded to the scene, though no arrests were made.
All the angst fades when you’re the country’s latest self-publishing sensation who has, pretty much single-handedly, managed to sell 32,000 copies of a book nobody would touch. It also feels nice to be on the verge of paying back the ₹ 5 lakh bank loan you took to do this. To go from new author with no credit line to favourite customer at the country’s largest commercial printer in a couple of months. It’s great when the country’s biggest English language book distributor takes you on board because they know it makes commercial sense, political affiliations be damned.
Florio mentioned we were awaiting confirmation of the story, and it’s been provided by Adam Schefter of ESPN this morning. Gruden is currently the coach of the UFL Virginia Destroyers. We’re guessing the UFL won’t make him pay a transfer fee to head to the NFL. Looks like John slept with Josh McDaniels’s mom. First order of business: trade Chad Johnson. Why wouldn’t they make him pay the transfer fee? Could you elaborate please? I was thinking the exact same thing!!! Hilarious!
Diver Gene Ritter holds one of the shells he found in the water under the Verrazano Bridge last year. The Coast Guard has permanently banned boats from passing through the bomb-littered area of Gravesend Bay. These unexploded machine gun shells are still in Gravesend Bay. The Coast Guard is permanently barring boats from passing through a bomb-littered portion of Gravesend Bay, but the decision makes it less likely that the agency will remove the 1,500 unexploded anti-aircraft shells that experts say could explode. Late last year, the military force established a temporary safe zone in the football field-sized portion of the bay next to the Brooklyn tower of Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.
Well, it's official. After months of rumors, SF Appeal has confirmed that the owners of the San Francisco Examiner have purchased the SF Weekly from Village Voice Media and will announce details this morning. Examiner reporter Mike Aldax also confirmed the sale in a tweet earlier today. In later December, Examiner co-owner/president/publisher Todd Vogt announced that his company, the San Francisco Newspaper Company, which also owns the Bay Guardian, was planning on buying another Bay Area publication — meaning either the SF Weekly or the Express. But Express president Jay Youngdahl quickly made it clear that the paper is not for sale.
It was a proclamation that cost one million pounds to make. One hundred years ago. On December 12, 1911 it was formally announced at the Delhi Durbar that Delhi would henceforth be the capital of British India. The 1911 Durbar, the third of its kind, was held probably at the peak of British imperial glory in India. It cost the British government in India upwards of a million pounds and took a long year of preparations. It marked the coronation of George V and was the very first visit of a British monarch to Indian soil; they arrived by ship through the Gateway of India in Mumbai.
About 1500 Shia Muslim protesters raised bread and banners as they shouted slogans urging the Sunni-led government to shun discrimination and find "decent jobs for all." The two-hour demonstration, including women covered head-to-toe in black chadors, ended peacefully, but it caused a minor traffic jam on a key highway cutting through the commercial Seef district on the outskirts south of the capital, Manama. The area is home to foreign banks, companies, shopping malls and the island's only five-star deluxe hotel, currently at full occupancy because of Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. "Wealth should be for all," read one banner.
SAO PAULO (AFP) - Four people died early on Tuesday when a float at the end of a Carnival parade ran into a power line and caught fire in the south-eastern city of Santos, officials said. Three of the victims were pushing the vehicle under the float and the fourth was an onlooker, the office of the mayor of Santos told AFP. Four other people were injured. The float belonged to the fan club of FC Santos, one of Brazil's top football teams, and paid homage to football great Pele, a former Santos player.
VANCOUVER — British Columbia is not trying to stop the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, but it is attempting to prevent environmental damage and hold the corporation responsible for the cleanup of a spill, a lawyer argued Monday. The province’s Court of Appeal is considering a reference case filed by B.C. that asks if it has jurisdiction to regulate the transport of oil through its territory and restrict bitumen shipments from Alberta. Joseph Arvay, who represents B.C., said the province has no “axe to grind” against pipelines and proposed amendments to its Environmental Management Act are not aimed at blocking the project.
The single biggest expense for nearly all international trips is the cost of the airfare.

Hwy 50 Corridor Transportation Management Authority officials are hoping that employees of major companies such as Intel, Kaiser, VSP and SAFE Credit Union will combine public transit and a LimeBike rather than get on Highway 50. The goal is to get new cyclists on the streets, though everyone is welcome to use the bikes. "Bike share is really about those people who don't bike on a regular basis," Tony Powers, board member of the management authority, told Folsom's City Council on Tuesday night. "It's a way to get some new people out there."

Astronauts lift our spirits. But can we afford to send humans into space? America’s first step in its attempt to reconquer worlds beyond our planet ended in spectacular success on Friday. An unmanned version of its Orion spacecraft soared more than 3,000 miles into space before splashing down on target in the Pacific ocean. The flight was hailed by Nasa, which says that the spaceship is destined to be the first of a fleet that will carry humans to the Moon, Mars and beyond. In many laboratories and research centres, this delight was shared by scientists.

Robert O. Freedman, Peggy Meyerhoff Pearlstone Professor of Political Science and president of Baltimore Hebrew University, is the author or editor of sixteen books on the Soviet Union, Russia, and the Middle East, most recently The Middle East and the Peace Process (University Press of Florida, 1998). How much of a role does Russia have in the Middle East? While Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov struts around the region trying to restore Russian prestige to its old Soviet level, his country's very severe economic and military weaknesses undercut his ability to make it a Middle Eastern power.
In a statement issued to the press, Microsoft did not make reference to the unusual step. Instead, it talked about the Release Candidate (RC) 0 "milestone" without mentioning the fact that RC0 is an unknown term in normal Microsoft parlance. As Hall explained it, the reason for bringing out the unusual RC0 release is that, while customers have been able to download and play with individual parts of Windows Server 2008, they really have been waiting to see the product as one. "They want to test out scenarios, and they can with RC0," Hall told ZDNet.co.uk.

Android phone. Photo via Shutterstock. Microsoft no longer provides financial support to FairSearch, the consumer advocacy group that appeared to have no other mission other to bash Google, according to Re/Code. This may surprise some as FairSearch was often described in the media as a Microsoft “front” or surrogate in the Redmond company’s bid to encourage scrutiny of Google’s business practices. It’s generally accepted that FairSearch regularly lobbied regulators domestically and overseas to take action against the search and advertising giant. FairSearch was founded in 2010 by a group of companies that competed with Google in travel search, including Expedia and Kayak.
Baltimore artist Amy Sherald, who graduated from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 2004 and just joined the faculty there, has been commissioned by the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery to paint the official portrait of former first lady Michelle Obama. New York-based Kehinde Wiley will paint the official portrait of President Barack Obama. The paintings are scheduled to be unveiled next year and added to the National Portrait Gallery’s popular collection of presidential and first lady portraits. Sherald’s portraits of African-American models are known for her use of gray skin tones.
I adored my father. Everything I have ever written about my relationship with him has been positive. Still, our bond was not always so tight. In fact, it was so strained at one point; I didn't speak to him for two years. I was angry for both real and perceived slights. This was a sad period. There was estrangement between me and my father, estrangement between me, my immediate family, and extended family members. There were no visits on holidays, no phone calls, and certainly no "Happy Father's Day" wishes on that special Sunday.
South Plainfield, which set a school record last weekend, winning a fourth consecutive state title, ends the 2018-19 dual meet season ranked No. 3 in the final New Jersey Wrestling Writers Association statewide Top 20 poll. Hunterdon Central (No. 7), North Hunterdon (No. 14) and Watchung Hills (No. 19) represent the Skyland Conference in the final rankings. Hunterdon Central advanced to the Group V championship, where it lost to Southern, which had a state semifinal win over reigning North 2 Group V champion Watchung Hills.
The Ready Player One movie took over eight years to make from the time the rights were acquired to the moment the film hit screens worldwide. Ernest Cline's novel of the same name was first published in 2011, but the story's journey onto the big screen began before that. Most of the time, Hollywood likes to adapt classic novels that have a built-in readership and fan base, but sometimes, certain properties get caught up in a bidding war prior to being published. One particular novel that comes to mind for most people is Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park.
Vignettes And Characters Shift In 'Chameleons' In The Book of Chameleons, a gecko narrator weaves fragmentary tales of invented pasts into a story of charming airiness. The prize-winning Portuguese novel is set in post-civil war Angola. The "beach read" has never held much appeal for me — just because it's summer, it's not like my IQ drops low enough to be talked down to by James Patterson. But as the temperature rises, my attention span drops, and suddenly an entire episode of Project Runway is difficult to get through in one sitting.
“I’m not a politician; I’ve never considered running for Congress until recently,” Janz told The Bee on Monday. “Most of the stuff in local and national media has pushed me to get involved,” he added, referring to a House Ethics Committee investigation into whether Nunes – chairman of the House Intelligence Committee – mishandled classified information related to the House Intelligence Committee’s Russia probe. It’s my desire to take what I’m doing now as a prosecutor and take that to the voters of the 22nd District.
PANAJI: Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) has scrapped its plan to purchase one more cruise vessel to conduct boat rides for tourists. GTDC chairman Nilesh Cabral said the move, which was planned two years ago, had to be scrapped as the department is unable to make the necessary investment of nearly Rs 15 crore. “We will add a vessel on a bare-boat basis. A tender will be floated shortly,” Cabral said. GTDC owns and operates two cruise vessels — Santa Monica and Shantadurga. These, along with the other private cruise vessels, conduct rides for tourists along the river Mandovi.
For this stroganoff, tender, seared, saucy slices of beef are topped with golden, crispy straw potatoes. When my wife and I were courting, 30-plus years ago, we were fans of the Time Life Foods of the World book series. It has several titles, with each book showcasing a different cuisine, such as French, Italian and Indian, and being adventurous cooks, we enjoyed learning about foods from around world. We must still like those books, because they are prominently displayed on a bookshelf in our living room.
The country singer suffers from viral cardiomyopathy. UPDATE: Randy Travis' publicist has released a statement clarifying the singer's treatment. "Contrary to reports, Randy Travis has not undergone heart surgery," representative Kirt Webster said. "Travis was admitted into a Texas hospital on Sunday and underwent placement of an IMPELLA peripheral left ventricular assist device for stabilization prior to transferring hospitals. The Grammy winner remains in critical condition." Country singer Randy Travis, 54, remains hospitalized with a heart condition, according to his sister-in-law Teresa Traywick. "We have been told he has had surgery.
Tonight, in my estimation, President Obama delivered a brilliant, spellbinding, and fitting speech about the Tucson shootings. This was the best speech I’ve ever heard him give. It can be divided into three parts – a tribute to the victims, a denunciation of attempts to use the incident to make partisan attacks, and a related call for more civility in politics. In making these points, Obama steered away from what is too often Topic A in his speeches – Barack Obama. I heard very little of the first person during most of this speech.
Courtney Noyes McLennan, a daughter of Mrs. Donald R. McLennan Jr. and the late Mr. McLennan of Ligonier, Pa., was married yesterday to Barnaby Myhrum, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Robert G. Myhrum of Peru, Vt. The Rev. Max E. Smith performed the ceremony at St. Michael's of the Valley Episcopal Church in Rector, Pa. Mrs. Myhrum's father was a vice president and director in the Pittsburgh office of Marsh & McLennan, the insurance brokerage concern, of which his grandfather, the late Donald Broderick McLennan of Lake Forest, Ill., was a founder in Chicago.
These policies will ensure consistent disclosure of cases of sexual violence and sexual harassment to hiring institutions. They will also ensure that hiring institutions ask about sexual violence and sexual harassment during the hiring process. Employees of the two units underwent an orientation program to learn more about what it means for their team to be part of UW–Madison and celebrated completion of the program and the transition with a group photo on the rooftop of the Pyle Center. An employee appreciation ice cream social was held for second- and third-shift staff the night of Aug. 1 in Varsity Hall at Union South.
Prospective travellers to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are required to comply with a new personal medications law unveiled by the Gulf nation in October this year. The new law required all tourists and residents entering the UAE with personal medications to seek approval from that country’s Health and Prevention Ministry before arrival. Persons who flout the new guidelines would have their medications seized at the point of entry. Mr Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, the Minister of Information, announced this at the bi-weekly media briefing, in Accra on Wednesday. He said prospective travellers were supposed to visit the website- www.mohap.gov.ae and provide the necessary personal medical information.

A. Yes, you could leave government and apply for a deferred annuity at age 62. However, you wouldn’t be able to re-enroll in the FEHB Program. No one who retires on a deferred annuity can do that. I was married to a Military member for 13 years in the divorce agreement he put in that I couldn’t receive anything off his military. He put in 22 years into the Military and then went to work and put in twenty years in the Postal as a carrier, can I draw from SS when I turn 62.
Survival strategy An endangered species of fish can produce offspring without mating, report US researchers. The discovery, published today in Cell Biology , is the first-known example of the asexual reproductive process known as parthenogenesis to have been uncovered in the wild. 'Virgin births' in the smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) may be triggered by the population's dwindling numbers, report the researchers. The smalltooth sawfish is a large, critically endangered ray that is estimated to have declined to 1-5 per cent of its population size since 1900. It is currently found mainly in southwest Florida.
The political galleries are full of people asking will he or won't he run for mayor here. But the Rev. Jesse Jackson, as he so often does, is playing a more elaborate political game, one in which his potential candidacy for office provides both a platform and his strongest bargaining chip. The Democratic Party should find a way to win statehood for the District of Columbia, thus creating a Senate seat he can run for, or he will do the thing that strikes fear in the hearts of many Democrats. He will run for President again.
As March Madness rolls on, the ACC has three teams worthy of being top seeds in Virginia, Duke and North Carolina in this year's NCAA tournament. Editor's note: This story has been updated with the latest NCAA tournament projections through games played on March 7. Last year the ACC sent nine teams to the NCAA tournament but only had one No. 1 seed — Virginia, which historically lost to No. 16 seed Maryland-Baltimore County. The conference ultimately didn't send any teams to the Final Four. Expect this year to be different. It's not because of depth.
Cup winners Heartland confirmed their supremacy over champions Pillars with a last-gasp 1-0 win in the Super 4 in Kano on Wednesday. Pillars filed out with the aim to avenge their 2-0 loss to Heartland in the Super Cup in Port Harcourt, but they could not even in front of their fans. Both sides played well, but Heartland were the luckier as new signing Happy Akuoka, who scored one of the goals in the Super Cup victory, scored the only goal in added time. Heartland media officer Cajetan Nwokpara told MTNFootball.com that it was a game that spectator got value for their money as both sides gave good account of themselves.
As Linkin Park prepares for its upcoming North American tour, frontman Chester Bennington is predicting a much shorter turnaround for the group's follow up to 2007's "Minutes to Midnight." "We sparked a new kind of life into what we do during the writing of ['Midnight']," Bennington tells Billboard.com. "We want to keep that going. I think we're in the mode, and I have a good feeling we're going to put another record out really quickly." Bennington says Linkin Park will be bringing gear on the road to capture ideas that come up on tour.

Asian stocks refrained from following global benchmarks on Tuesday as welcome housing data from China and better than expected Australian consumer confidence pleased buyers. Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P500 and Nasdaq 100 were all losing nearly 0.1% after earnings from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup lagged behind market consensus. Global indices were previously taking advantage of upbeat data from China and positive clues concerning the US-China trade deal. China’s home prices (MoM) grew +0.6% in March versus +0.5% in February while crossed 10.4% forecast on a yearly basis by flashing +10.6% growth.
Critic Scott Marks had a good week at the movies: three stars each for the Asian heist film Golden Job (someone finally got wise and started letting us review these little releases at big theaters) and the animated musical Smallfoot(!) They eased his disappointment with Assassination Nation, and may even have given him the motivation he needed to get to Night School. Speaking of school, I liked the smart-kids-rule doc Science Fair, though not as much as I might have. My big win for the week: I Am Not a Witch. More films out of Africa, please.
Should all schools ban the use of mobile phones? AUSTRALIANS love their technology but surely there have to be limits on how much we are all glued to our mobile phones. News that some Queensland schools are banning the use of phones to improve social behaviour of students and curb cyber bullying will no doubt create some angst among both pupils and their parents. Anyone who knows me, knows I love shiny new phones. But as I watch people fixated on these devices while they are at a meal with friends or even playing in a park with their kids, the realisation of how stupid it all is becomes super clear.
IBM has offloaded its failing x86 biz to Lenovo for $2.3bn, albeit a day later than our sources had predicted. The pair have entered into a definitive agreement - days after talks were confirmed - which includes System x, BladeCenter and Flex System blade servers and switches, x86-based Flex integrated systems, NeXtScale and iDataPlex servers, software and maintenance. According to Gartner, IBM turned over $5.5bn worth of x86 kit in 2010 but by the end of 2012 the unit had increased that to $5.6bn. Under the terms of the deal, Lenovo will cough $2.07bn in cash with the remainder in stock.
Solitary Confinement Is What Destroyed My Son, Grieving Mom Says Venida Browder's son killed himself after spending time in solitary confinement. She's fighting to end isolation of youth in jails and prisons. A new campaign with that goal launches this week. A solitary confinement cell at New York City's Rikers Island jail. This week, an unusual coalition of corrections officers and policy experts will come together in Washington, D.C., with one common goal in mind — to limit the use of solitary confinement for juveniles. The campaign has enlisted some powerful voices to warn about the harms of isolation for young people.
“Rockstar” spends a second week atop the ARIA chart. Post Malone’s “rockstar (featuring 21 Savage)” again ranks as the top song in Australia. The single tops a second consecutive edition of the ARIA Australian Top 50 Singles Chart. Its closest competition comes from Macklemore’s “Glorious (featuring Skylar Grey),” which rises one spot to #2. Dua Lipa’s “New Rules” falls one spot to #3, while Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’ “Same Love (featuring Mary Lambert)” re-enters the chart at #4.
DeKALB – Seniors in DeKalb County can buy their license plate stickers for $24 by filling out a Benefit Access application. Shari Hanson of the information and assistance department at Elder Care Services, 1701 E. Lincoln Highway, said Benefit Access is an ongoing program with the Illinois Department of Aging and Secretary of State's Office. The program, which used to be called Circuit Breaker, is available for seniors older than age 65 and those receiving disability benefits. The recipients also must provide proof that their 2016 income is not above $27,610 for a single person or $36,635 for a couple.
BEIJING (Reuters) - Suspected Chinese abuses in the region of Xinjiang should be addressed through engagement with the government, the new EU ambassador to China said on Friday, a contrast to the position of U.S. officials who are considering sanctions. Reports of mass detentions and strict surveillance of Muslim ethnic Uighur people in the far western region have sparked a growing international outcry. A U.N. rights panel said last month it had received credible reports that up to a million ethnic Uighurs may be held in extra-legal detention, and called for them to be freed.
Astronomers scanning the skies for far-flung planets have found that the area surrounding a nearby star is very familiar. A report published in the current issue of the Astrophysical Journal suggests that Vega, located 25 light-years away from our sun, may have an orbiting planetary system that is more similar to our own than is any other yet discovered. As for how well the predictions will hold up, time will tell. "The model predicts that the clumps in the disk will rotate around the star once every 300 years," explains Wayne Holland of UKATC, who worked on the original SCUBA recordings.
A top transportation priority in Louisiana is halfway through the statehouse. The House voted overwhelmingly in favor of two bills to get work completed on the state’s portion of Interstate 49. The legislation now moves to the Senate. If approved there, it would move to the governor’s desk. Gov. Bobby Jindal filed the Capital Outlay Bill, which would enable completion of the I-49 project. The bill – HB2 – includes $73 million in funding to help finish one of the two remaining sections of the roadway. The funds would enable the state to complete the north and south portions of I-49.
What do you hope for in the coming year? What holy dream keeps you searching in the midst of darkness? I donât mean what the children are waiting for Santa Claus to bring them in a few weeks, but we could all learn something from the earnestness and energy of that childish anticipation. Most of us adults are too shy or fearful or even ashamed to name our big and lasting hopes. We make do with lesser things, like shopping for things that wonât answer our hopes for more than an instant. This is the place of hope and the season of hope and the community of hope.
The Uttar Pradesh government Monday suspended a doctor in a case of medical negligence in which a teenager declared dead by him regained consciousness in a mortuary in Muzaffarnagar district. Radhey, 17, woke up in the mortuary at the Muzaffarnagar district hospital Sunday, nearly 10 hours after the doctor, Pradeep Mittal, declared him dead, an official said. The victim was brought to hospital from a forested area where he was found in an unconscious state Saturday, police said. Mittal declared Radhey dead Sunday morning and directed the ward boys to shift "the body" to the mortuary.
THE FLOODGATES ARE OPEN: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ proposed overhaul of rules for how schools handle allegations of sexual harassment and assault is officially out for public comment and advocates are rushing to flood the posting over the next two months. — The 60-day public comment period ends Jan. 28. The administration has touted its controversial overhaul as a historic move that will for the first time create formal regulations — through a notice-and-comment process — for schools responding to sexual harassment claims. — The effort comes after Murray and Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) gathered with advocates this week to urge people to comment on the proposal.
CS 248 is an introductory course in computer graphics, covering a variety of topics: fundamentals of input, display, and hardcopy devices, scan conversion of geometric primitives, 2D and 3D geometric transformations, clipping and windowing, scene modeling and animation, algorithms for visible surface determination, introduction to local and global shading models, color, and photorealistic image synthesis. For the last two years, the central project of the course has consisted of writing a triangle renderer (scan-converter) which encompasses sampling techniques, texture-mapping, and, optionally, special effects such as depth-of-field and motion blur.
How did Quark manage to get the massive market share that it has of the publishing world? Was it the typographical precision? Because we have the best product. Quark has 90 per cent of the share in publishing and that’s reasonable (laugh). Reliability, ease of use and a very strong architecture so that it is flexible and can be changed, and the extensions. I have people coming to me and saying that when they use the competitor’s products, they spend double the time. And time is quite valuable.
You come up out of the subway in midtown Manhattan and you’re not quite all the way to your destination. Where’s the bus? You need a transfer. President Trump seemingly found himself in the same position as New York commuters these days. He’s getting some money for his border wall. But he’s not all the way there yet. The border security package approved by Congress grants the President $1.375 billion for a physical barrier. Mr. Trump wants $5.7 billion. In other words, Congress wields the ultimate power of the purse in American government.
Here's an interesting blurb out of North Dakota: the state is considering rolling back its requirements for substitute teachers due to a shortage. The state has some of the toughest requirements for substitute teachers out there, generally requiring them to hold a full teaching certificate and a full four-year college degree. Most states have pretty lax rules for substitutes, and the practice of putting long-term subs in classrooms and rotating them has been one of the ways states have gotten around the "highly qualified" rules in the NCLB law. North Dakota's proposal would allow Title I paraprofessionals with a 2-year degree to serve as substitute teachers.
Earlier this month, Judge Richard Seeborg stopped the Trump administration's 'remain in Mexico' program, ruling the government doesn't have the legal authority to keep these asylum seekers south of the border; Claudia Cowan reports from San Francisco. The Senate confirms President Trump's nominee Eric Miller to be a judge on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals 53-46 in a party-line vote. The Supreme Court ruled that the decisive vote in a California pay dispute case before a lower court doesn’t count -- because the vote came from a judge who died before the ruling was issued.

April 1, 2019, was certainly not a day for fools. The Supreme Court of Appeal gave judgment in the case of Beukes v Smith (211/2018)  ZASCA 48), for a surgeon whose information to his patient was called into question. The decision really highlights the value of keeping proper records of discussions leading to an informed consent, to avoid protracted legal proceedings. According to the Health Professions Council of SA's ethical guidelines, informed consent is: "Patients must be given sufficient information, which they can understand, to enable them to make informed decisions about their care.
CHARLESTON, S.C. – An investigation by the College of Charleston found men&apos;s basketball coach Doug Wojcik likely verbally abused players, using threatening, degrading and profane language in dealing with the team — including using a homophobic slur against one player. A report of the school investigation was obtained by The Post and Courier of Charleston. College of Charleston President Glenn McConnell said in a statement Thursday he was consulting with appropriate staff about the findings. The 50-page report contains summaries of interviews with Wojcik and 26 others, including current and former players and assistant coaches, college staffers and athletic director Joe Hull.

Swag and other Chanticleers mixed with a group from Mars Hill College, located outside Asheville, N.C., to play football on the beach. He was happy they weren’t alone. One couple traveled from Virginia Commonwealth University with no real plans, just a couple of backpacks and a car. Hari Nagarajan and Kathleen Lau said they were going to go to Florida, though they didn’t make any reservations. Nagarajan said they made it to Charleston before getting bored. After spending some time in the historical port town, they headed to Myrtle Beach. The pair wore masks at the beach.
Texas Central Railway hopes to construct a high-speed rail line that would connect Dallas and Houston. The railroad boasts that they will use Japanese N700 Series Shinkansen electric trains to complete the 240-mile journey in around 90 minutes. The next meeting is right here in our backyard. Whether for or against the proposal, now is the time to voice concerns or show support for the project. The company touts that the 200-mph train will consist of eight train cars with a 400 person seating capacity. The cars will run each way every 30 minutes during peak periods, and every hour for non-peak periods.

Amid growing controversy over Megyn Kelly’s racially insensitive comments about blackface, NBC News has announced that it has canceled Kelly‘s 9 a.m. hour of the Today Show, Megyn Kelly Today. Kelly came under fire earlier this week for saying that she doesn’t understand why blackface Halloween costumes are racist during a roundtable discussion on offensive costumes on her talk show, Megyn Kelly Today. However, several of Kelly’s NBC colleagues, including Today show hosts Craig Melvin and Al Roker, denounced her comments on Wednesday. Kelly then apologized on-air during Wednesday’s Megyn Kelly Today.
More than 100 people packed a public meeting last night to speak against rules that would open bobcat hunting and kill raccoons and coyotes. More than 100 people packed the seats at a public hearing Thursday night that carried on for more than three hours, largely to implore state officials to stop what many attendees called the "senseless murder" of "innocent animals." The animals in question: bobcats, coyotes, raccoons and opossums. The loud and clear message — meant for both the state's Department of Natural Resources and its Natural Resources Commission — was delivered in opposition to two rules being proposed by the department.
This year, there will be fewer X Factor live shows and the debut of 'Super Sundays'. The X Factor is taking the unprecedented step of releasing its full schedule for series 12 – in hopes of dodging an "unavoidable clash" with Strictly Come Dancing. In the wake of ITV director Peter Fincham publicly asking the BBC to prevent head-to-head clashes, a full list of dates and times for The X Factor was released tonight (August 26). Of course, The X Factor airs its first of seven audition rounds this Saturday (August 29) at 8pm.
Two men have been charged in a shooting in Chambersburg last week that left two people injured. Ryan O'Neil Jefferson of McConnellsburg and Christopher Curtis Darby of Chambersburg have each been charged with criminal attempted homicide, aggravated assault, persons not to possess a firearm, riot and discharge of a firearm into an occupied structure, according to the police report. Authorities were dispatched Saturday, March 30 to a report of shots fired at about 5:24 a.m. in the 300 block of South Main Street. Police said in a report several people got into an argument at a party in the area, which led to gunfire that struck two people.
The Pentagon recorded 11 domestic UAS missions in FY 2018 -- as many as it recorded from 2011 through 2017. The US military used the MQ-9 Reaper in five domestic operations in FY 2018. The Pentagon this month published new data on its domestic drone use, documenting 11 missions during the 2018 fiscal year. That's up from 11 missions over the entire span of 2011 through 2017, as noted by Dan Gettinger, co-director of Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone. Most of the military's 2018 missions fell under the category of "Defense Support of Civil Authorities."
At freshman convocation this September, University President Lawrence S. Bacow gave students their “first homework assignment”: to register to vote and cast a ballot. This was not a one-off line: It reflects a carefully orchestrated campus-wide effort to get out the vote. *Is “explainer journalism” obnoxious?

A Belfast man who has blazed a trail in the United States with his coverage of soccer’s English Premier League has announced that he has signed a deal with America’s oldest broadcaster. Phil Brown, whose “Beyond The Pitch” podcasts have been featured on Sirius for a number of years, will now appear on the NBC network. NBC has agreed to host both Brown’s podcast and a separate Manchester United broadcast. Brown, who immigrated to California in 2001, told the Irish Echo that he was excited at the link-up.
The people who failed to conduct protest campaigns when garbage mountains were dumped at Meetotamulla resulting in the loss of 33 lives are today engaged in bogus protest campaigns when a scientific solution is found to the garbage problems, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said. The Minister was speaking at the Mega Minds Program held at Dambulle recently. The Minister said that although floods, garbage, traffic congestion, slums and dengue were problems of urbanisation, the popular ideology in the past was outward city beautification by laying roads, pavements and placing flower pots.
But for the kinds of people who stay through the end credits -- pretty much the same types who scour liner notes on record albums -- the real interest may lie elsewhere. More than a few will be fascinated to see that Robert Pollard, former leader of the disbanded indie-rock stalwart Guided by Voices, has done his first film music for this quirky drama about the doings in an Ohio doll factory. The Hollywood heavy-hitter and the Ohio-based outsider have been crossing paths for some time. After Mr. Soderbergh mentioned his love for Mr. Pollard's music in an interview a few years ago, Mr. Pollard made contact.
Microsoft is doubling down on its support for the Do Not Track (DNT) tools in its coming Internet Explorer 10. Despite some criticism the company plans to go ahead with its decision to turn on the DNT setting by default, though Microsoft says there will be an option to disable it during the initial IE setup process. While Firefox, Safari and Opera also support the Do Not Track header, which tells websites and their advertising partners not to track your movements around the web, IE 10 will be the first to enable it by default.
The company management projected 25 per cent revenue growth for the next three years. The domestic security business, the Australian business and its facility management service contribute 37 per cent, 47 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. ET Intelligence Group: The priceearnings’ valuation discount of Security & Intelligence Services (India) (SIS) to staffing companies TeamLease Services and Quess Corp may narrow after the country’s second-largest provider of private security services demonstrated market share gain-led revenue growth in its domestic business and margin expansion potential across three major verticals.
Barnes Regional Airport Manager Brian Barnes addresses residents Monday about changes in noise levels around the airport. WESTFIELD - Changes in flight operations at Barnes Regional Airport, both military and private aircraft, have resulted in changes in the noise impact levels on homes in and around the airport. That is what residents living near the airport were told at a workshop Wednesday night at North Middle School. Those changes have resulted in a reduction of about 50 percent the number of homes that will now qualify for noise mitigation proposals offered by the Federal Aviation Administration.
I used to think that life was a blueprint: set in the works of the future skyscraper you would end up making yourself out to be. I was so dead set on certain dreams and aspirations, some of which I still want to carry out and some which I have set to the back burner, that I would nearly pull out all my hairs trying to force myself to stick to one path. This past summer, I took William & Mary’s D.C. Summer Institute in Leadership and Community Engagement, and in that class I was given the greatest opportunity: time to reflect.
Reporter Justin Campbell joined the News 6 team in December 2018. As a respected journalist from WVLA in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Justin loves the thrill of breaking news stories, but also loves a great human interest story, which makes him a well-rounded asset to the News 6 team. Justin has covered everything from the police shooting death of Alton Sterling that sparked riots to multiple Mardi Gras parades on Bourbon Street. The Houston native attended Arizona State University, where he double majored in Economics and Environmental Sustainability. He only fell into journalism after a college girlfriend took him to one of her journalism classes.

An outline of a back window can be seen from behind a home on Masonic that burned on Sunday. Smoke pours from a home on Masonic on Sunday afternoon. A fire that claimed a home at Topaz Lake on Sunday started at a power pole within yards of a similar blaze that occurred last year. While the cause of the fire is under investigation, initial reports from residents were that the pole was completely ablaze.
Turkey "will never tolerate threats from anybody," Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said after US President Donald Trump tweeted to warn Ankara about "large sanctions" over the arrest of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor being tried on terrorism and spying charges. "Noone dictates Turkey. We will never tolerate threats from anybody. Rule of law is for everyone; no exception," Çavuşoğlu said in a tweet on July 26. Presidential spokesperson İbrahim Kalın, on the other hand, said "threatening language is unacceptable," while calling on the U.S. "to adopt a constructive position."
JOHANNESBURG – Israel says it will renew diplomatic ties with the largely Muslim African country of Guinea, the latest step in Israel&apos;s courtship of the continent. Israel&apos;s foreign ministry announced Wednesday that the two countries would restore ties after 49 years. The news comes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&apos;s four-nation Africa tour earlier this month. It was the first visit to sub-Saharan Africa by a sitting Israeli prime minister in nearly three decades. Israel is pursuing closer security and other ties with Africa.
“With or without a decorated tree, you have a home ready for the holidays with minimal effort,” she says. Barbara Rodts of Leawood is sold on deep-frying the turkey. It tastes great and gives the menfolk something to do outside, monitoring the fryer. Most important, it frees up the ovens to prepare the rest of the meal. The biggest holiday meal challenge is having all the parts ready at the same time. For presents, Sue Farley, who lives near Weatherby Lake, has switched from gift bags to reusable shopping bags — two gifts in one, and cheaper.
SECOND LEASE ON LIFE. Flavia Nampiima, 30, was attacked with acid on the night of October 6, 2009, on her way home from school. After undergoing treatment including surgery, Nampiima, did not let the scars from the attack define her life. She opens up to Esther Oluka on restoring her life after the attack. On October 6, 2009 night, Flavia Nampiima had just returned home from university when she noticed a suspicious short human figure in trousers roaming their compound at about 8pm. Their house, in Ntinda had an enclosure without a gate.
PARIS, May 10 (Reuters) - Artists at one of the most-visited hubs of contemporary art in Paris are in a battle with city hall to preserve the status quo at their “aftersquat”, where visitors can freely view 30 painters and sculptors in the throes of the creative process. The artists, who have travelled from as far away as Japan and the United States to set up in the former illegal squat, say a plan to reduce the number of permanent workshops in order to have more artists move through will kill the family spirit of the site, now leased and legal for several years.
PARKTON, Md. (AP) | Lynne Ferguson had 228 turkeys roaming in her backyard this summer, and she plans to have twice that number next year. The former nurse and construction worker has found her calling as a turkey farmer, raising the birds all year long for her customer’s Thanksgiving tables. Miss Ferguson says she decided about six years ago to start farming to make sure she was getting safe, nutritious food. She started raising chickens with her son for a 4-H project and later added Berkshire pigs - a heritage breed - before adding turkeys two years ago.
Remember When Doctors Gave Clay Walker a Death Sentence? In 1996 a doctor told Clay Walker he'd be in a wheelchair by 2000, and dead by 2004. It was a grim prognosis for a singer who was just beginning a superstar career. He was 26 years old, had a handful of No. 1 hits and a baby girl waiting for him at home. At first, the Texan just accepted the news. Fortunately his doctor was woefully misinformed and dead wrong. Multiple Sclerosis wasn't, and isn't, a death sentence.
Insulation materials are designed to reduce the heat flow by limiting heat transfer through conduction, convection, and radiation while facilitating vapour flow and water condensation of a process.The insulation materials such as mineral wool, polyurethane foam, polyethylene, extruded polystyrene, expanded polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, and fiberglass help in insulating the building envelop, reduce energy consumption, and reduce the emissions of greenhouse gas, and offers comfort and safety. These insulation materials find use in residential construction, non-residential, HVAC and OEM, oil and gas, wires and cables, and automobiles.
An inmate makes a phone call from his cell at the Orange County jail in Santa Ana, California, May 24, 2011. The New York City Council voted this week to provide free telephone calls for anyone held in the city’s correctional facilities. The move will save New York City inmates and their families an estimated US$8 million a year. Until this law takes effect, phone services in the city’s jails will continue to be provided by Securus Technologies which, like other private companies, charges inmates and their families, the ultimate ‘captive customers’, at higher than average rates.
Parents of Isaiah McGinnis, a 12-year-old fatally struck while walking home from school, say there should've been a crosswalk at the intersection. The parents of a 12-year-old fatally struck by a vehicle less than half a mile from his school in Peoria last fall are seeking a combined $15 million from the school district and others, according to two notices of claim. Isaiah McGinnis was walking home from Santa Fe Elementary School on Oct. 10 when he was fatally struck by a truck as he tried to cross Peoria Avenue at 77th Avenue, according to the claims filed by both parents.
Sources close to Williams who are planning the news event refused to divulge details of the announcement to WND. Williams has demanded that Bill Clinton participate with him in a DNA test to verify his claim. The conference will be hosted by a non-partisan coalition of civil rights, child-welfare and pro-life leaders. Speakers, in addition to Williams, will include filmmaker Joel Gilbert and Dr. Randy Short, who heads the Brothers in Support of the Million Woman Movement, headquartered in Washington. The Williams newser comes on the heels of FBI Director James Comey’s announcement that the criminal investigation into Clinton’s private email server has been resumed.
Lenovo revamped its data center strategy, launched a bevy of products, and set out to be the No. 1 supercomputing vendor. Here's a look at the plan. Lenovo launched 14 server platforms, seven storage systems, and five network switches in one swoop and laid out its data center battle plan. Now the big question: Will Lenovo's big data center push pay off? After assessing Lenovo's products and strategy, and interviewing execs, it's apparent that the company has one thing it hasn't had since acquiring IBM's x86 server business in 2014: A comprehensive plan.

OGDEN — The first phase of the river restoration project along the Ogden River Parkway is more than half completed. Current renovations are most visible between Washington Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue. Crews have begun work near Gibson Avenue and will work east toward Washington Boulevard. The riverbed has been widened as a way to restore the river to its historic condition. Stepping stones, timber pathways and a ramp have been added to provide access to allow trail users and fishermen to get closer to the river.

Five of the Menlo Park City Council candidates met up at the Oak City Bar and Grill in Menlo Park on Wednesday night to share campaign stories. The drinks were on Peter Ohtaki, since he received the greatest number of votes. The sixth candidate, Russ Peterson, was unable to attend. Photo by John Woodell. ● Ohtaki, Keith, Cline elected to Menlo Park council. Whoa, wait! There are three pending council members having a conversation- but where is Peter Carpenter with a Brown Act accusation? What if the new council has to act on something like an Oak City noise complaint case?
DETROIT -- Detroit Red Wings fans will be seeing Amway's logo featured prominently below the iconic winged-wheel and hearing the Ada-based company's name a lot on radio and television over the next three years, maybe more. The Red Wings on Thursday announced Amway as the first presenting sponsor in the franchise's 86-year history. Amway's logo, which was placed on the team's practice jerseys and practice pucks last year, will be much more prevalent at Joe Louis Arena – on the ice, on the scoreboards, on game tickets, and on a variety of advertising and marketing ventures.
If a burglar can’t find your safe, he can't break into it. When adding a wall safe to your home, be smart. Obvious places, such as behind a picture on the wall in the library or master bedroom, might not be your best bet. Those are likely the first places a burglar will inspect. The best rule of thumb is that the harder the wall safe is to find and the longer it takes to get to, the better your chances of the burglar leaving without locating your valuables.
Kooiman plays softball each spring and soccer each fall. But this year, she opted out of soccer and played competitive volleyball for the first time since eighth grade. Come winter, however, it’s all about hoops. “It’s been my favorite sport my whole life,” she said. This season has started well for Kooiman and the Lions, who open Northwest Conference play Monday when they host Burlington-Edison. Last season, the Lions went 23-4 and advanced to the Class 2A state championship game before falling 49-43 to Shorecrest, which they had beaten in the district semifinals.
Meet the Spendor A7, the perfect blend of traditional and contemporary UK design and sound. American and British speaker design ethoses have always been very different. American brands such as Klipsch, Tekton, Vandersteen and Zu all share a common proclivity for dynamics and colorful sound. Brit brands such as Harbeth, KEF and Spendor are more reserved. Their Britishness always shines through as they seduce the ear. Take this new speaker from Spendor, the A7. It looks the part; nothing flashy going on here, just an elegant design that should stand the test of time.
The Slovak milk and dairy industry has had to face the reality that a government with no cash cannot support the free flow of milk any more. The Velvet Revolution in 1989 brought a rapid decline in the production and consumption of milk and dairy products, caused by a dramatic rise in prices. This drop in consumption is alarming since people aren't getting the neccessary yearly amount of dairy products according to the Ministry of Health. The recommended yearly consumption of milk and dairy products per person is 220 kilograms but in 1997 it is expected to be just 161.2 kilograms per person (see chart 2).
As an owner, it's hard to justify spending $2-6K on something we DON't NEED to fly. It's no benefit since we already have an IFR system that functions without it and a VFR system with the lowest accident rate in history. This is a made up, government mandate where some office bureaucrat made an arbitrary decision. Those of us who have to deal daily with reality of flight and the practicality in ownership are being forced to do so only because "they say so". Of course when things are of demonstrably dubious advantage and high cost AND mandated, normal people don't like it.
The major candidates for Illinois governor, Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn and Republican state Sen. Bill Brady, released new, sharply contrasting television campaign ads Thursday. Quinn focuses on his opponent, tying him to the gun violence that produces tragic headlines almost daily in Chicago. Brady focuses on himself, presenting a sunny but vague picture of what he would do as governor. In stark terms, the ad tries to do two things: tie Brady to gun violence and plant the idea that Brady is a potentially risky unknown. The ad opens with images of a gun.
Report: Tamir Rice grand jury never voted on indictment. Cuyahoga County prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty at a press conference in Cleveland on May 9, 2013. The grand jury that declined to indict two police officers in the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice never actually voted on whether to bring charges, an investigative report from Cleveland says, leaving open the question of how the controversial decision was actually reached. The alt-weekly Cleveland Scene’s report revolves around the concept of the “no-bill,” which is the name for a grand jury’s formal decision—arrived at by voting—not to bring charges in a given case.
But neither player will come to Boston risk-free. By landing two of the best hitters on the free-agent market this offseason, the Boston Red Sox continue a quest to re-energize their stagnant offense. But the deals struck with Pablo Sandoval and reportedly Hanley Ramirez on Monday, do come with risks. Sandoval, 28, a third baseman and World Series standout for the San Francisco Giants, has agreed to a five-year contract worth about $100 million. Giants assistant general manager Bobby Evans said he got a call from Sandoval, who informed him he was leaving to play for the Red Sox.
The Google Guarantee has been associated with Local Services ads, but the two programs are technically distinct. A Google spokesperson clarified earlier today that local ranking in Google Home voice search results is based solely on organic relevancy — not paid advertising. Google Guaranteed local listings that appear may be from the database of Local Services advertisers, but there are no ad placements in voice search results on Google Home. Currently, if users search for “plumber,” for example, Google Home will take consumers through a short interaction to confirm their location (and perhaps the nature of the job) and then offer up a list of results.
Universities should be hit with the “nuclear” option of huge financial penalties for failing to recruit enough students from poor backgrounds, the Government’s new fair access tsar has warned. In an outspoken attack, Prof Les Ebdon said he would use the toughest possible sanctions against institutions in England that consistently fall short of demanding admissions targets, including a ban on charging £9,000 tuition fees. The academic – named as the Coalition’s preferred choice as head of the Office for Fair Access – suggested that universities belonging to the elite Russell Group faced the biggest challenges because they had a “mixed” record on admitting deprived students.
FORT DRUM, N.Y. -- U.S. supremacy is increasingly contested in the land, air, maritime, space and cyberspace domains -- and the electromagnetic spectrum -- as rivals innovate and leverage technology. One of the ways the division is preparing for the fight of tomorrow is by employing a team of experts from the Space and Missile Defense Command located at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado to train their Soldiers on the nature of electronic warfare in the field and in the classroom. "When we talk about many practices in the Army, we're talking about the past 16 years of fighting counter-insurgency operations," said Capt.
Aylesbury boosted their chances of finishing in the promotion play-off spot in the Southern Counties North with Saturday’s 29-0 win over Stow-on-the-Wold. After their disappointing trip to leaders Reading last time out, Aylesbury went into this game at Ostler’s Field focusedon securing second place for the third successive season. And the Ducks increased their chances of that with this bonus-point victory as they scored five tries to maintain their five-point lead back to third-placed Buckingham. “The game was definitely a tale of two halves,” said coach Dave Larham afterwards. “But based on the need to win our remaining games we will take it.
The Met Office has shown it can predict the weather one year in advance with its new £97 million supercomputer. Scientists believe they can now forecast with some accuracy the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) weather phenomenon in the Atlantic Ocean which largely governs the British winter. The phenomenon forms because of low-pressure over Iceland and high pressure over the Azores in the Atlantic. A large pressure difference brings increased westerly winds, cool summers and mild, rainy winters. In contrast when the difference is small there are fewer winds and Britain shivers in a big freeze during the winter months.
STAMFORD -- A city transgender person was arrested early Wednesday morning after police say she sexually assaulted a teenage boy at Stamford Town Center in April. Isaiah Johnson, 20, of 202 Ursula Place, was charged with second-degree sexual assault and is being held in lieu of $25,000 bond. Youth Bureau Sgt. Dedrich Hohn said Johnson, who is known to patrol officers in the South End, was picked up at 2 a.m. Wednesday on Atlantic Street near Veterans Park, where she met with the youth before the April 26 incident. Hohn said the patrol division was alerted to Johnson's arrest warrant Monday night.
OAKLAND >> First-year Santa Cruz Warriors coach Aaron Miles didn’t need to do a re-enactment of Gene Hackman in Hoosiers and put two-way guard Quinn Cook on his shoulders to measure the height from the floor to the rim at Oracle Arena on Sunday night. The Warriors, playing in a substantially larger venue than their home facility in Santa Cruz, felt quite comfortable in their lone appearance this season on affiliate Golden State’s home court. After all, many of the athletes on Santa Cruz’s roster played in enormous arenas while in college, representing heralded universities like Duke, Kentucky and Louisville.
SIXTY years after Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to climb Everest, the world’s highest mountain is a busy place. When the weather is good in mid to late May, the upper slopes are crowded with hundreds of climbers. With every step available to view on YouTube, you might think there is nothing left to explore on the roof of the world. You would be wrong. A team from the Centre for Altitude, Space and Extreme Environment Medicine (CASE) at University College London recently spent several weeks on Everest studying hundreds of trekkers, climbers and Sherpas.
This letter is to urge voters to vote "No" on Proposal 3. This proposal will promote voter fraud and cause massive confusion at polling places on voting day. Polling places would become like clerk's offices when people show up at the polls on Election Day to be registered to vote. More staff would be required leading to voting delays. It would also make it more difficult to validate the voter's eligibility to vote. Michigan has approximately 95 percent of those eligible to vote on the registration rolls. Let's keep up the good work.
Crypto mining has made new graphics cards expensive and scarce, but a review of 44 older cards confirms they still work just fine. Here's how to find a deal on a GPU. The graphics card market is suffering right now due to a supply and demand problem. Manufacturers continue to produce a lot of new cards, but gamers are finding it difficult to locate stock, and when they do the prices are sky high due to demand. Why? Cryptocurrency miners, who rely on the latest GPUs to keep their mining rigs profitable.
INDIANAPOLIS – About 16 hours of worry turned out to be nothing for the Pacers and their top player. On Friday afternoon the NBA decided not to suspend forward Paul George for leaving the bench during an altercation between Pacers guard George Hill and Hawks forward Mike Scott during the second quarter of Thursday night’s Game 6 at Philips Arena in Atlanta. George took a step off the bench when Hill and Scott exchanged shoves but was quickly back to the bench area after that. None of the players involved in the altercation received a penalty either through a fine or suspension.
On "Shark Tank," John Bailey said his bestseller was a fart-scented candle. I'm not an angel investor. Nor am I likely to be providing venture capital anytime soon. So you would think reading a comprehensive guide to angel investing would be of little interest to me. In fact, often the best way to approach a situation is from a totally different perspective. Say you want to build a thriving business. You could list everything you think is important in founding, growing, and maintaining a startup, and build your company that way.
MUSKEGON, MI - More than 100 years ago, Michigan's transportation pioneers developed U.S. 31 as a gateway to tourism on the West Michigan Lakeshore. On Monday morning, today's tourism innovators officially designated that same route the West Michigan Pike, the state's newest Pure Michigan Byway. Representatives from the Michigan Beachtowns Association, Michigan Department of Transportation and Travel Michigan all took part in the short ceremony held at Muskegon's Heritage Landing. The newly designated route stretches more than 184 miles along Michigan's west coast and includes St. Joseph, Benton Harbor South Haven, Saugatuck/Douglas, Holland, Grand Haven, Muskegon and Silver Lake.
Not one but a pair of Mitchell minor baseball teams claimed the Ontario Baseball Association (OBA) ‘C’ division championship over the Labour Day weekend. The Mitchell Stickhandler Major Mosquito OBA Astros won the Inter-County Baseball Association Mosquito Tier 2 championship on Aug. The rising ebb and flow in any sporting event can lead to championships – or not. Perhaps that’s why so many people enjoy the game. Another season of Mitchell Minor Baseball’s Junior Rookie Houseleague has started and already there are definite signs of improvement. The Mitchell Senior Astros won their Midwestern Ontario Senior Baseball League home opener against Hanover 14–6 last Friday night.
Why do you want to meet Devendra Singh?" stressed the Congress candidate's spokesman, "You ask me, I'll tell you everything you need to know about him." Advocate A L Lohati thrust a haath chaap pen into our hands and quickly pulled a photocopy of the official authority letter signed by the Congress candidate. On his maiden campaign trail as a Lok Sabha candidate, we are told Devendra Singh is inaccessible. "He is in the interiors, even television people wanted him -- but we had to turn them down," says the enthusiastic spokesman.
A stand-off is continuing in the Lockyer Valley, west of Brisbane, with police surrounding a remote farmhouse where a gunman is holed up after shooting dead a policeman yesterday. Police say the alleged killer, 40-year-old Rick Maddison, is alone at the property at Adare near Gatton, and officers have been negotiating with him since midnight. They confirmed he was armed with an automatic or semi-automatic weapon. Officers said Maddison shot and killed Senior Constable Brett Forte, from the Toowoomba Tactical Crime Squad, when he was intercepted on a road at Seventeen Mile in the Lockyer Valley on Monday afternoon.
Located on a route connecting the Black Sea to Central Anatolia, the rock-cut Virgin Mary Monastery is now hosting guests amid the start of the summer season. The historical monastery, built in a natural cave on a rocky hill in Kayadibi village in the Black Sea province of Giresun’s Şebinkarahisar district, can be reached after a 15-minute walk. Due to snows and rainfalls, transportation to the monastery becomes harder. But in the summers interest grows at a rapid pace among those who want to see the historical spot. The monastery is nearly one hour away from the Black Sea tablelands and provides alternative tourism opportunities to nature tourism.
South Korea’s job creation has been slower than last year despite the government’s push to tackle worsening employment conditions, date showed Saturday. According to the January-August jobs data, the number of employed people stood at a monthly average of 26.74 million, up about 107,000 from the same period a year earlier. The growth is down from the 335,000 on-year gain tallied during the same period of 2017, the data showed. Experts say that the government’s aim of adding 180,000 jobs this year will be hard to achieve given the current job growth pace.
Sharon Gort, of Talsma Jewelers, stands by her first-place scarecrow, "Pappa Time. GRANDVILLE - More than 600 event-goers cast their votes Oct. 10 during the second annual Fall Festival and scarecrow contest, selecting Talsma Jewelers as the first-place winner.

"I knew I wanted to make something with a patriotic theme this year, but it also needed to incorporate the store," she said.
The PC market is still in decline and shipments of traditional desktop and notebook PCs took a nosedive during 2013. PC manufacturers are introducing new features such as ultra HD displays and touchscreens in an effort to compete with the rapidly-rising tablet market, Though the ability of these features to turn around the PC market is in doubt, not all PC devices are seeing the same declining sales. Market research firm ABI Research this week released a new report showing that 2.1 million Chromebooks were shipped during 2013. Chromebooks are low-priced notebooks designed around Google’s Chrome operating system.
Doctor Who spin-off moved production to California. Originally filmed on location in Cardiff, Torchwood moved to the Los Angeles Warner Bros. studios after executive producer Russell T Davies signed a deal with US TV channel Starz last year. The move, which was arranged because of the series’ increasing popularity with American audiences, upset many Torchwood fans, but the drama’s star John Barrowman insists they won’t be disappointed with the new series. ‘Weâre filming a lot of scenes in American locations,â Barrowman told the Daily Mail.
SAN FRANCISCO (CN) — A federal judge Thursday ruled that Berkeley’s mayor and former mayor must sit for depositions in the U.S. Postal Service’s lawsuit accusing the city of blocking the sale of the historic downtown post office building. U.S. District Judge William Alsup granted only in part the city’s motion for a protective order to prevent the deposition of 12 city officials, allowing the Postal Service to depose four of them. The Postal Service asked to depose Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin, its former Mayor Tom Bates, nine current and former City Council members, and one Planning Commission member.

Re: "Property tax relief has a cost - A little more in your pocket means a lot less for city services, leaders say," Sunday news story. This story suggests Texas lawmakers want to pass a cap in city tax increases. This solution doesn't confront the real problem. In business, you do a root cause analysis to determine the problem source, so you can eliminate the problem altogether. What is the root cause of runaway property taxes? In my view, it's runaway school taxes. What are the causes of lack of school funding?
Did you know that for less than $20,000 you could build your very own password cracker that, under ideal conditions, could try out more than 100,000,000,000 passwords EVERY SECOND?

I was fortunate enough to attend one such event.
Several Swiss based non-governmental organisations are to lose funding from the EU. The move seems to be linked to Brexit. The EU says its review of its funding programme has determined NGOs not based in the Union are not eligible. The review was triggered by looking at the future relationship with the UK after the country leaves the EU. Switzerland is also in its own fraught discussions with the EU to determine its future relationship. The main organisations to be affected are Médecins Sans Frontières, Caritas, and World Vision. The decision will not affect specific operations being funded by the EU across the world which may involve Swiss based NGOs.
The Site Evaluation Committee is charged with approving the $1.6 billion project. Its members will tour part of the proposed line's route, stopping at more than a dozen spots between Plymouth and Deerfield. The tour is expected to take roughly seven hours. The committee made site visits in the North Country back in July. The overall route runs from Pittsburg to Deerfield, through more than 30 communities. Given the controversy around Northern Pass, protesters will likely show up during Tuesday’s tour. The committee is expected to make a final decision on the overall project by late February.
Meet the miracle kitty who survived 18 days without food amid the debris of ground zero. Emergency workers rescued Precious the cat from the debris-covered roof of a damaged apartment building across from the World Trade Center. The 9-pound Persian suffered eye injuries, burns to her paws and smoke and dust inhalation. But the feisty feline was able to stay alive by lapping from puddles of contaminated rainwater. “It’s unbelievable. It’s a miracle. I can’t believe she’s alive,” said D.J. Kerr, who owns Precious.

The United Nations treasures its partnership with Columbia University. We are not just neighbours in New York; we are allies across the world. I want to share two simple and short messages. First, despite the dangers we face, remember that you are graduating into an era of wondrous opportunity. We are appalled by war crimes in Syria and elsewhere.
Why are we seeing ads on Netflix? Should we be worried? Adverts on Netflix are starting to appear for more and more users. Initially trailers were run at the end of shows, now they're appearing before them also. Obviously people paying for the Netflix service have taken to the interwebs to explode with outrage. But what is actually going on? "We are not planning to test or implement third-party advertising on the Netflix service. For some time, we've teased Netflix originals with short trailers after a member finishes watching a show.
This highly rated subwoofer-'n'-satellites setup includes NFC for quick pairing with compatible devices. You know I love me some Bluetooth speakers, but the vast majority of the deals I see (and share) are for the portable variety. Those have their place in the world, but what if you want a speaker system for the den or living room, something intended to stay put? In the old days those were known as bookshelf speakers, and they were typically paired with a stereo receiver. These days, our music lives on (or streams from) our phones and tablets, meaning we need bookshelf speakers designed to match.
Sandra Bland died back in July in a Waller county, Texas jail after she failed to make the $5000 bail. Since then, the family of Sandra Bland and the arresting officer involved in her case, as well as the jail staff, have been at odds over how she died. Sandra Bland was found hung with a plastic bag in her cell three days after being arrested during a traffic stop that became violent. On Monday, a grand jury ruled that there would be no indictments brought against Brian Encinia, the arresting officer in her original traffic stop, or any other law enforcement personnel.
A fisherman has told how his brother-in-law twice saved him from drowning, then died in freezing seas himself after suffering a seizure. Father-of-three Douglas Hook was forced to leave his friend and business partner in icy water and swim four miles to safety after 11 hours in the sea. The 38-year-old had launched into a new career fishing for whelks with friend John Askey, 31, when tragedy struck. On 17 June the men, both from Pembroke Dock, west Wales, were on a maiden voyage in Cardigan Bay in their 12-tonne trawler on their first working day together.
Traces of lead pollution buried deep in the Greenland ice are being uncovered, revealing the rise and fall of ancient European civilizations. Air pollution isn't just a modern thing: Humans have been polluting the Earth's atmosphere for thousands of years. Now, traces of lead pollution buried deep in the Greenland ice are being uncovered, revealing the rise and fall of ancient European civilizations, according to a new study. "We found that lead pollution in Greenland very closely tracked known plagues, wars, social unrest and imperial expansions during European antiquity," said study lead author Joe McConnell of the Desert Research Institute in Reno.

KUALA LUMPUR: The first six months after eateries nationwide have been gazetted as “no-smoking” zones from January, will be more of a grace period to educate and warn smokers. “Although we have the authority to penalise offenders, according to standard practice, the first six months would be more towards warning and education. “But if there are still some stubborn smokers, then the officers can straightaway penalise them,” Deputy Health Minister Dr Lee Boon Chye said during a press conference at Parliament yesterday. There are 5,008 environmental health officers from the Health Ministry tasked with enforcing the ban.

An in-depth look at some brilliant engineering. The drinking bird is an iconic desk toy, right up there with Newton's Cradle, but can you explain how it works? The principle is unintuitive at first glance, but beautifully simple in hindsight, like only the most mesmerizing bits of engineering are. It stumped Albert Einstein, who could not immediately figure it out. It will drink twice as fast if it's drinking whisky. The bird does not drink at all. The hat isn't a fashion statement; it hides a small stem used to fill and seal the birds innards.
Hah! I wish we teachers could *pick* our students like these parents pick the teachers. We don't prefer students who yell, don't like to learn, lose their things ... etc. IT hurts our feelings too! I agree wholeheartedly. I would love to be able to pick my students as well. Let's see... I'd rather not have students who talk back, don't do their homework, bully other students, or generally behave disrespectfully. Oh, but then again, as a teacher, I don't count.
Before we go any further, let's make one thing clear: the polar bears maybe aren't that big a deal. That's just one of the hints Lost executive producers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof dropped about the sixth and final season of the show when we interviewed them at the show's Hawaii premiere party. They also told us a bit about the Man in Black, promised to explain the Smoke Monster, and told us who's really dead. TVGuide.com: The show raises a lot of questions, but is there anything that fans have focused on that you never intended to be a big deal?
Gov. Steve Beshear has sent a letter to the state-created Kentucky Employers' Mutual Insurance urging it to use some of its $147 million surplus, as of Sept. 30, to reduce premiums or issue a dividend to the businesses it serves. KEMI was created by the General Assembly in 1994 and offers workers' compensation insurance. "While most businesses in our state have struggled over these last few years, it appears that KEMI is faring very well financially," Beshear wrote. "I think it's appropriate and prudent for your organization to consider providing some relief to our struggling Kentucky businesses in these unprecedented fiscal times."

Reigning AWFA league and cup champions Myrtleford won't be taking a backward step in 2019. The Savoys have moved quickly to cover the loss of last year's Star Player Tom Youngs by welcoming another English strike weapon in Remell Davis. Co-coach Matt Park is delighted with the signing of the 23-year-old. "When we realised we were losing Tommy, we got onto it pretty quickly," Park said.

Sad news. Anton Calleia, a close friend of Ken Reich and a fellow OFS member, sent me an e-mail this morning saying that Ken died in his sleep last night. Ken was a retired staff writer for the Los Angeles Times. In his three-plus decades with the newspaper, Ken covered City Hall, wrote a column and was a lead reporter on the 1984 L.A. Olympics coverage. Those of you who attended last Wednesday's OFS luncheon noticed that Ken arrived and left in a wheelchair, the result of a defibrillator episode he experienced on the last two days of his recent weeks-long cruise around Africa.
Former world-champion skater Tai Babilonia is set to be the latest celebrity that goes bare to protest fur on Tuesday. The gold-medal winning figure skater will reveal more of her figure than usual when she takes to the rink at Rockefeller Center wearing only a sign. Well, she'll also be wearing a flesh-colored thong, if that's anything, according to PETA, when she shows up at 12:30 p.m.
"Just because it's cold outside doesn't mean we should be cold inside," said Babilonia in a statement put out by the animal-rights group.
Thanks to a new phone application developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, birds around campus can easily be identified in a matter of seconds. The free iOS application Merlin is designed to be a “friend and a birding coach for beginners,” according to Miyoko Chu, senior director of communications for the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Chu said the name “Merlin” represents the application’s “seemingly magical ability to identify birds.” “However, the magic of the app is really in the science and the help from the thousands of people who helped build it,” she said.

Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor reportedly said on Thursday that journalist Jamal Khashoggi's death was "premeditated." The official made the determination based on information from Turkish investigators, according to a statement from the kingdom's Foreign Ministry first obtained by The Washington Post. Riyadh initially denied any knowledge about the whereabouts of the dissident journalist, who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Oct. 2. Last week, the kingdom announced that 18 people had been arrested and five officials were dismissed after Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributor, was accidentally killed in a fistfight by "rogue agents."
Tash Sultana On World Cafe : World Cafe Hear a performance from this guitar prodigy, looping master and righteous singer — she plays every instrument herself, live onstage. Tash Sultana performs at World Cafe Live in Philadelphia. If Tash Sultana didn't put her guitar down at the end of her performance, you might assume it was attached to the end of her arm. The same is true of the pedals and her feet. If you've ever seen her live, you might still not be convinced that she and the instruments she plays are separate entities.
(HOST) As the season for summer blockbuster movies about super heroes and rings of power approaches, commentator Willem Lange is feeling nostalgic for other mighty champions of yesteryear. early western United States. Nowhere in the pages of history can one find a greater champion of justice. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. From out of the past come the thundering hoof beats of the great horse Silver! The Lone Ranger rides again!" How many times I must have heard those lines, and how impressive they must have been, to be remembered 70 years later?
Clement Lefebvre, leader of the Linux Mint project, shared a very lengthy blog post today, and it really made me sad. You can read part of it below. And no, this sad tone is not an April Fool's prank, sadly. It’s not always easy to achieve what we want, sometimes it’s not even easy to define what we want to achieve. We can have doubts, we can work really hard on something for a while and then question it so much, we’re not even sure we’ll ship it.
Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture Emmanuel Bwacha yesterday said Taraba State Acting Governor Garba Umar was prevented from seeing ailing Governor Danbaba Suntai for security reasons. He claimed that Umar’s actions showed that he was “not favourably disposed” to seeing the governor back in office. The senator, who represents Taraba South, said Umar was “too desperate for power”, adding: “We are aware of what the scriptures say that the world is actually running on its own, but we should be able to tell the world that there are those who Satan is trying to use now that the world is rounding up.
Four months after it was found in a watery pit at an abandoned factory in Aurora, the body of a 27-year-old man has been identified and returned to the man's native Mexico for burial.

AUSTIN, Texas — Most jail bookings in large Texas counties are for misdemeanor offenses, and low-level, nonviolent offenses are among the most common charges leading to jail booking, a new study from Texas Appleseed reveals. The report, An Analysis of Texas Jail Bookings: How Texas Counties Could Save Millions of Dollars by Safely Diverting People From Jail, examines the charges leading to jail booking and how long people are staying once they are there. Based on an analysis of only 12 Texas counties’ jail booking records, the report finds that tens of thousands of people are booked into jail each year charged with the lowest-level misdemeanors.
Those who have been tracking the sales of firearms recently will not be surprised at the accompanying chart, which shows the leading months for background checks based on the FBI&apos;s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. All federally licensed firearms retailers must conduct a mandatory NICS check before completing the retail sale of any new or used firearm, making NICS statistics a solid indicator of firearms sales. This sustained boom in the face of an unprecedented recession is evidence that Americans are sticking to their guns in times of uncertainty. And the boom continues at close to record high levels.
Burnley defender Matt Lowton may have upset Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock once upon a time! Matt Lowton may have rubbed Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock up the wrong way when weighing in on the ball boy behaviour row six years ago. The defender, who was at Aston Villa at the time, revealed Warnock's dark arts in utilising ballboys as a tactical ploy to slow games down whenever necessary. The 29-year-old was an apprentice at Sheffield United during Warnock's reign at Bramall Lane and took on the matchday role during the Blades' last stint in the Premier League in 2006/07.
For a state that prides itself on the concept of home rule, it’s amazing how often those who disagree with the decisions of city and county elected officials go running to Austin for help from state legislators. The latest example is an amendment to this year’s Texas Department of Transportation reauthorization bill by Houston state Rep. Gary Elkins, a Republican. It would give the Department of Public Safety control of red-light camera systems and ban the renewal of local contracts. The House backed the proposal, the Senate opposed it, and the dueling versions go to a conference committee for resolution.
There are a lot of loose ends to tie up after someone dies. They include removing or memorializing social media accounts. Don't let your loved one's social media accounts languish. The fate of a Twitter account might seem trivial when a loved one dies. Sure, social media handles probably won't be worth as much as bank accounts. And they're unlikely to have the same emotional value as jewelry or record collections. They're easy to forget ... until they remind you they're still out there on the web.
Martin Tibbitts was co-founder of the World Heritage Aviation Museum based at the Oakland International Airport in Waterford. Martin J. Tibbitts was an entrepreneur but his passion was flying vintage military aircraft. “I fell in love with Cold War jet aviation,” Tibbitts, who went by Marty, told the Free Press in 2015. Tibbitts was at the controls of one such plane, a de Havilland DH112 Venom, on Friday when it crashed shortly after takeoff from Sheboygan County Memorial Airport in Wisconsin. Tibbitts was killed when the plane struck a barn. Two farm workers also were injured.
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Bojan Bogdanovic scored 24 points and the Indiana Pacers tied an NBA franchise record by making 19 3-pointers in a 136-94 win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night, handing LeBron James the most lopsided loss of his career.

Brooklyn-based brothers Steven and William Ladd have brought the eclectic fruits of their eponymous design practice to the masses, creating winsome charm necklaces for Anthropologie. The Steven & William Invisible Pet and Colony Necklaces, each $144, artfully elevate a gag prop and common bug, respectively, by casting them in gold and placing them at the end of long, gold chains. The Invisible Pet Necklace refers to those goofy dog leashes with no dog at the end—something everyone's seen, but never in so charming a setting as a delicate piece of jewelry.
That was Paul Dickov’s verdict after Doncaster’s play-off hopes suffered a setback at the hands of in-form Peterborough United. Goals from Luke James and Conor Washington earned upwardly mobile Posh a fourth straight win in front of a season high attendance of 11,520 at the Keepmoat Stadium. Doncaster dropped to tenth in the League One and host automatic promotion chasers Swindon Town tomorrow night on the back of one win in six – needing a result of some description to stay on the coattails of the top six. Dickov said: “We’re really disappointed.
Ashton Smith of LCCC, as well as John Wood College players, watch as his double sails to deep centerfield in the third inning of the first game Friday’s doubleheader in Godfrey. The hit was originally a triple, but the ball became lodged in the ivy at the base of the centerfield fence and it was ruled a ground-rule double. Smith, who later scored in the inning, was seven-for-eight at the plate in the twinbill split. JWC won the opener 8-7 in nine innings, but LCCC won the nightcap 12-2 in five innings.
The brother of rugby league player James Ackerman, who was killed after a high-impact shoulder charge in 2015, has been scathing of the decision to clear Billy Slater, saying it "insulted" his brother. Slater was cleared by the judiciary on Tuesday night after a marathon hearing and deliberations of nearly an hour by the three-man panel. Andrew Ackerman posted on Facebook after the verdict, with a picture of his brother in a hospital bed. "The 'shoulder charge' door was opened back up tonight and this helpless guy was insulted," he said in the post.
FLINT, Mich. - Flint Firebirds head coach Eric Wellwood gathered his players near the end of practice on a crisp November day to announce a sudden change of plans. Practice was supposed to conclude with running stairs in the arena. But Wellwood canceled the exercise, citing his team's hard work over the previous 90 minutes. Perhaps he was also rewarding the group for capturing its first win the day before, a 7-4 triumph over the rival Sarnia Sting following an 0-16-1 start to the season. Wellwood, 28, inherited the worst team in the Ontario Hockey League three weeks prior.
Ophthalmologists can earn a good living diagnosing and treating eye conditions. 4 How Long Do Plastic Surgeons Go to College? Ophthalmologists are doctors who have gone through medical school, an internship, residency program and often an additional year or more of training in a subspecialty. They are qualified to diagnose and treat all eye conditions and diseases and perform complex eye surgeries. Ophthalmologists should not be confused with optometrists, who are licensed to examine and diagnose vision problems, eye diseases and other conditions, as well as prescribe glasses, but can perform only minor surgical procedures, such as removing a foreign body from the eye.

Larne manager David McAlinden has admitted he doesn’t know if he will return to management. The 33 year-old is set to leave his post in the coming months, it was announced after a meeting with chairman Archie Smyth last week. “I don’t know if I will manage again as there is a question mark over that or whether I want to,” he reflected after Saturday’s 2-0 defeat to Lurgan Celtic. “Larne will always be a special club to me, the same way as you think about the first club you played for and look out for their results.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg must recuse herself in the U.S. Supreme Court, argues Freedom Watch's "Judicial Selection Task Force." If she does not do so, she should be involuntarily disqualified by a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court. The task force I started as general counsel of the public interest law firm Freedom Watch is leading this effort nationwide. Most immediately, Justice Ginsburg must recuse herself voluntarily in the case challenging President Donald Trump's moratorium on travel from six failed states under his Executive Order 13769, "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States," 82 Fed.
Although he stumbled through a letter, the home-schooled seventh-grader spelled "geta" correctly Thursday to be crowned the district spelling champion. After the two previous spellers in the Alachua County district bee had misspelled raj and tamale, Pierce Tolar, 12, felt the pressure. All he had to do was spell the next word right. "I thought, ‘I know this word,' " Pierce said. "I just gotta focus." Although he stumbled through a letter, the home-schooled seventh-grader spelled "geta" correctly Thursday to be crowned the district spelling champion, winning over 37 other fifth- through eighth-grade students.
An interview with the wife of Taysir Alluni, Fatima al-Zahra. Aljazeera: Was Taysir ever involved in legal problems in Spain or has he ever been previously arrested? Fatima al-Zahra: No. This has never occurred. A: But this was circulated by some in the media. FZ: I assure you that Taysir has never been detained before.

DAVID BECKHAM has stated he wants Zlatan Ibrahimovic to stay at Manchester United for the rest of this season. Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho has today confirmed he would not stand in Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s way if he wanted to leave Old Trafford. The Big Swede is currently on his way back to full fitness following the serious knee injury he suffered last season. Beckham, who today officially launched his Miami-based Major League Soccer team, admits he can see Ibrahimovic playing in America one day. But the former United midfielder wants the 36-year-old to remain in the Premier League for the time being.
Philanthropist John Arrillaga ‘60 is reportedly working on building concepts for Stanford-owned lots in Menlo Park. Arrillaga is “working on some concepts for these sites that are consistent with the [Menlo Park] Specific Plan; however, they are not yet ready for possible application to Menlo Park or for public release until an application is filed,” Jean McCown, Stanford director of community relations, said to Palo Alto Online. The five lots, previously automobile dealerships, run along El Camino Real on the boundary of a Menlo Park downtown renovation project called the Specific Plan.
I see that this is the time to start a lot of fall vegetables, but they like it cool and my yard is like an oven in the summer. How can I do this? One way is to start them indoors, even leaf crops like endive. A cool basement works well. When they're a few inches tall, you'll need to acclimate the transplants to sun and heat conditions before you put them in the ground. A good time to transplant them into the soil is when a few days of overcast weather are forecast.
Belinda Earl, style director of Marks & Spencer, has over 20 million customers to keep happy. And she knows very well that – however enthused the fashion critics may get over limited-edition, catwalk-referencing pieces – most of those 20 million do not want a pink coat. But fashion matters at M&S, because womenswear occupies a talismanic position in the business. Fashion images reach a far greater audience, via media and social media, than other product categories, and fashion is a key motivating factor in luring the overwhelmingly female customer base into store or online.
Nearly 400 buffaloes are facing slaughter after having wandered outside Yellowstone National Park. This winter&apos;s massive snowfalls have blanketed the buffaloes&apos; territory, making it necessary for them to wander farther to find food. Many buffaloes made their way into parts of Montana, where they were greeted by angry cattle ranchers who insisted that the buffaloes be killed so that they could not infect the ranchers&apos; cows with brucellosis, a disease that can cause miscarriages. Interestingly, there has never been one reported case in which a buffalo has spread brucellosis to a cow; it has only been accomplished in the laboratory.
The Missouri Marketers and Convenience Store Association has collected enough signatures to ask voters if the state’s cigarette tax should be increased by 23 cents per pack to help pay for transportation. Missouri’s cigarette tax is the lowest in the nation, at 17 cents per pack. Missouri Department of Transportation Director Patrick McKenna says the increase would generate about $95-100 million dollars annually for the state’s roads and bridges. The signatures must be verified by the Secretary of State’s office. McKenna was disappointed that the Legislature didn’t pass a funding measure this year, but he hopes it will next year.

Direct bidders took 9.01 percent versus 8.70 percent last month. The results of Tuesday’s auction “aren’t super impressive, but they are encouraging in the context of today’s broad market cheapening,” said Thomas Simons, senior money market economist at Jefferies.
A Reader Poll: How Are the Olympics Being Covered In Your Country? finally read a serious take on the subject. So what does he tell us? They’re too edited. We want to see all the downtime between races! I have opinions about all this, but it occurs to me that I should first take a poll. I know I have readers in other countries, and I’d like to know what the prime time coverage of the Olympics is like elsewhere. So let me know in comments. Are they tape-delayed? Are they oriented toward hometown athletes?
The Paradise Jam tournament wasn’t a walk in the park for UConn, with back-to-back physical games testing their bodies, but the No. 2 Huskies made sure to find time to relax while in St. Thomas. This team is already really close, UConn coach Geno Auriemma said, so the players have enjoyed the extra time they’ve been able to spend with each other. Auriemma says it’s important to let his team have fun when it comes to tournaments such as the Paradise Jam, but the key to having a good week lies in knowing how to manage work and play.

The Iranian military test-fired a high-speed torpedo close to the strategically crucial Strait of Hormuz Sunday, according to an NBC news report. Iran tested its Hoot torpedo, an alleged derivative of the Russian Shkval, which is capable of traveling at speeds much greater than traditional torpedoes. The new weapon will be able to travel at around 250 miles per hour for up to 12,000 yards, defense officials told NBC. It is unclear whether or not the test was a success. Iran last tested the torpedo in February 2015, and at least one other time in 2006.

Interco Inc. reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it might be forced to sell its Converse athletic footwear business to ease the debt burden it incurred to avoid a hostile takeover in 1988. The St. Louis-based footwear and furniture maker said it would put Converse up for sale if its plans to sell $140 million in other assets falls short of expectations and its earning and cash flow do not exceed current expectations. Interco is seeking to complete a restructuring of $1.9 billion in debt. Under its plan, bondholders would receive 95 percent of Interco's common stock in exchange for their bonds.
The proper role of religious discourse in political discussion and decision-making has been a subject of long-running interest among scholars working in a variety of fields, from law and political theory to philosophy, theology, and ethics. Participants in these debates have described the problematic features of religious argumentation in different ways, but they have usually focused their analyses on the content of religious claims. In Prophecy without Contempt: Religious Discourse in the Public Square, Cathleen Kaveny is concerned with the divisiveness of our contemporary religious and moral discourse. She begins her book with a critique of efforts by prominent scholars to explain this polarization.
Lorde has been named Best International Female Solo Artist at the Brit Awards, and she called the honour a "priceless surprise". Lorde beat Janelle Monae, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Pink to the award, which was given to her during the star-studded Brits ceremony at the O2 in London.

Saturday, May 4, 2019. The Heritage Fine Arts Guild of Arapahoe County presents another in a series of one-day workshops led by popular Denver artist and teacher Victoria Kwasinski. Victoria asks the question: “Remember when you were a child, and you were lying in the grass and found stories and shapes in the clouds?” We will explore finding shapes, themes, stories from initial washes of color and mark making. Then, using our intuition, we will develop these ideas into a great painting. This workshop is for artists of all levels and all mediums.
Sometimes a sentient ball of hair and dust just wants a cherry. That’s the whole point of Chuchel, the latest puzzle and exploration game from Czech indie studio Amanita Design. Its past work includes surreal point-and-click adventures such as the Samorost, Machinarium, and Botanicula. It’s slated for a release in early 2018 for PC, iOS, and Android, and the full game will have over 30 levels. I played a demo of Chuchel at Double Fine’s indie game festival Day of the Devs. Like previous Amanita games, it focuses on interaction with your surroundings to solve puzzles.

President Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party has won two-thirds of the vote in Zimbabwe's parliamentary elections. The result enables the president to change the constitution to install a successor without immediately calling elections as presently required. So far the party has taken 71 of 120 contested seats, and Mr Mugabe can appoint another 30 deputies to the 150-seat parliament. The opposition, which has 39 seats, has spoken of "massive fraud" in the poll. In the last parliamentary election in 2000, the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) won 58 seats.

"I've got stuff from all over the world about fluoride -- who uses it, who doesn't," he said. "The people who don't use it have better dental records [than we do]. People just don't know about it. All I was trying to do was find us some money. I found us a million dollars, and nobody wants to take it. People need to hear about it.

Authorities are investigating how a missing man from Virginia ended up in what's supposed to be a secure area of Kennedy Airport, soaking wet on a runway after he allegedly swam across Jamaica Bay, law enforcement sources tell News 4 New York. Mark Mogensen, who's in his early 20s, was reported missing from a mental health facility in Sterling, Virginia, that he'd entered voluntarily on July 14. On the morning of July 16, Port Authority police officers spotted Mogensen, wearing a shirt and shorts, completely soaked, on a runway at JFK Airport, the sources said.
Kim Kyung-Hoon / Courtesy Reuters The Great Hall of the People is silhouetted against the setting sun in Beijing, October 23, 2014. REBECCA LIAO is a corporate lawyer and China analyst based in Silicon Valley. China’s quest to establish greater rule of law started with the country’s 15th Party Congress in 1997. It was an expedient move: China's economic machine was kicking into high gear, and ascension to the World Trade Organization was imminent. Both would require a legal regime that, at the very least, protected property rights and regulated commercial dealings.
Colombo Court Hotel & Spa is at the heart of Colombo’s artistic quarter, minutes from where Geoffrey Bawa, one of the greatest architects of the 21st century, had his private residence and also his office, now the Gallery Café, where he sketched out the current Houses of Parliament. The owner is a fascinating character, who holds court with everyone from film directors to writers in the evening, where he will over delicious cocktails explain how he is reducing the carbon footprint of the building with the aim of becoming a totally carbon neutral.

Tails will be wagging at The World of Pets in Lowestoft on June 22 as a Dog Tea Party takes place with tasty treats for your four-legged friend. There will also be plenty of refreshments for two-legged guests too and the chance to grab a ‘tea party selfie’ with props and party hats. There event is in partnership with Wilsons Pet Food so each dog will also receive a goody bag to take home.
New York’s bike share really does attract way more commuters than tourists. Since its debut last year, New York City’s bike share system, Citi Bike, has been wildly popular. In its first six months of operation, the bright blue bikes logged more than 5 million trips. The system has nearly 100,000 annual members. Yet Citi Bike–which unlike most bike shares in major cities, isn’t subsidized by public funds–is losing money. One of the main reasons is that while annual memberships are popular, the much more profitable day passes aren’t.
It's a well known fact that the holiday season increases humanity's innate attraction to sparkly things. Women wear sequins or gold or silver lamé on purpose, in the hope of looking like walking tree ornaments. Many people purchase glitter or tinsel in large quantities for some reason. And several people ingest really expensive pills in order to give their excrement that festive look (no one actually does this, but, well, people could). What is the definition of a "shiny moment"? Oprah awkwardly clutching your shoulders from behind? Smiling so hard your back teeth hurt?
I help organizations catalyze radical innovation by harnessing VUCA. We’ve all heard the phrase “fail fast,” especially if we’re familiar with the agile approach. As counter-intuitive as it might sound for those of us trained in the leadership model of the industrial era, iterating fast failures achieve a desired result faster than perfecting the solution. In the complex digital revolution era, trying to predict, control, and eliminate variances is a losing game. Reducing variance inevitably meets the law of diminishing marginal returns: the cost of reducing variance eventually exceeds the benefit.
Sarasota County, Florida-- The Health Department lifted the "No Swim" advisory for Lido Casino Beach on Lido Key that was issued on Thursday, August 16. Sarasota County Health Department officials received testing results from samples taken yesterday, Tuesday, August 21, that were at a satisfactory level that meets both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state recreational water standards, the county governent explained in a release. Residents and visitors may return to swimming and other water sports at this beach site. The "No Swim" advisory signage will be removed.
The Milwaukee group includes producer Wavie Boi B, rapper Wavie Boi D, rapper and singer H1 Da Hook, singer Marx Solvila, and hype man Gassmann. When Wyclef Jean heard the beats, he said he was "caught by the Holy Ghost." In November 2016, the Grammy-winning rapper, renowned for his work in the Fugees and his own solo career, was in Milwaukee to judge the Rémy Producers Series competition. Branden Washington — stage name Wavie Boi B — won the round, and took second place in the finals in Chicago three months later.
BAGHDAD, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Iraq asked Kuwait Energy to acquire shares of Turkey’s state-owned TPAO in its exploration block 9 oilfield after Iraq’s cabinet decided to expel the Turkish company from the project, a senior Iraqi oil official said on Wednesday. The measure will mean the Kuwait Energy will hold 70 percent of the project and Dragon Oil PLC 30 percent. TPAO holds a 30 percent stake in the block. “The cabinet rejected the approval of Turkey’s TPAO as a partner,” Abdul Mahdy al-Ameedi, head of Iraq’s contracts directorate, told reporters.
President Alvaro Uribe’s decision this week to authorize Senator Piedad Cordoba to mediate hostage releases by FARC guerrillas has been received with great relief, especially on the part of the hostages’ families, but also plenty of perplexity. An increasingly difficult political climate both at home and abroad may be part of the reason behind Uribe’s surprising move. The FARC and the government had been in a stalemate since April, with the President repeatedly rejecting the guerrilla group’s condition that Senator Cordoba be present at the site because he would not allow the liberation to become guerrilla propaganda.
Recently, there's been an explosion of membership-based online sales sites. Gilt.com remains one of the most well-known, but insiders are already joining spots like Rue La La, and Editor's Closet). Now there's Closet Couture, a social and networking site that's so new it's still in beta (so get in while the getting's good). Even better, the website is teaming up with Presse, an LA boutique run by former fashion editors, to offer seven Rodarte pieces that were shown on the runway but never produced.
Electronic Arts is partnering with AOL Sports on an online sports trivia game called EA Sports GameShow, which will add daily live-hosted sports trivia sessions to AOL Sports' online content. EA says the programming will get daily updates, plus an interactive "FanHouse Challenge Hour" on Mondays. Users can compete against one another on text, audio and video-based sports trivia questions. The flash-based trivia show is online at eagameshow.com. Both companies highlight the "live interactive" angle here, but if you don't like sports, you won't like the game show.
Epping, Sydney, 5.30am, and David Koch is doing his first broadcast of the morning from the Seven newsroom. Strangely, it's not for Seven. It's a business report for another employer, Sky News. He's a busy boy, Kochie. Palamedia, his ASX-listed company, provides regular business updates for a variety of radio and television stations, making him the financial equivalent of the ubiquitous Eddie McGuire. Soon they make their way to the studio. The set is garishly citrus, like the backdrop for a tequila ad.
I didn’t notice, but I’ve been told George W, Bush delivered his latest speech smoothly, more so than most of his speeches. He has certainly practiced the stay-the-course storyline. How many times have we suffered White House fanfare for a presidential speech that will finally solve the mystery of our foreign policy? How many times have we listened, only to reluctantly conclude that George W. Bush is indeed a broken record, and worse for wear? George waved the bloody shirt at Fort Bragg, recalling 9-11 and global terrorists.
Earlier this week during an interview at the D8 conference, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg did the unthinkable: after finding the hotseat a little too toasty for his liking, he took off his hoodie. Interviewer Kara Swisher quickly discovered that the hoodie had a mysterious badge stitched on the inside and joked that Zuckerberg was in a cult. And then the Internet went sort of nuts. Tweets abound about Facebook’s Illuminati-like status. The folks at SFWeekly managed to recreate the diagram and did a thorough analysis on what it might mean. The Next Web declared that it was creepy.
Want to understand how bee-killing neonicotinoids (a class of insecticide) work in less than two minutes, and why you should care that the EPA does nothing to reverse the damage that these pesticides have done to our pollinating insects? Watch this brief video that explains it all. Tyrell’s summary is a brief insight into why neonics are ‘bad for everything.’ The European Union has imposed a two-year moratorium on all neonics, but the US still allows them to be sprayed everywhere. In fact, the EPA has decided to allow more of these bee- and butterfly-killing chemicals to enter the environment despite clear dangers.
Although Edmonton Oilers CEO Bob Nicholson apologized for publicly criticizing Tobias Rieder's play this season, the Oilers forward sounded off on the incident Friday. "You kind of can't believe it. I feel like it's disappointing and I'm offended by it," Rieder said, according to TSN's Ryan Rishaug. "I'm the first one to admit I haven't had a good year." Nicholson went off on a tirade at a breakfast for season-ticket holders Thursday, directly blaming Rieder's individual lack of production for the team's precarious playoff position.
Bill Belichick wasn't messing around against the Redskins. The undefeated New England Patriots probably don't need any help to knock off the Washington Redskins at home on Sunday. Still, in the early going, Bill Belichick is already going for the jugular. On the Patriots' opening drive, the Patriots went for it on fourth down despite being in field goal range. They ended up scoring a touchdown. Then, following the touchdown, the Patriots kept the ball for themselves. And that's because of an onside kick that caught the Redskins off guard.
Best travel backpack, duffel bag, packing cubes review 2018. The essentials you need for any kind of trip. There is one kind of travel, say, on the Titanic, where packing means steamer trunks, tasteful hatboxes, and a hard-shell case for your Stradivarius. Then there’s the kind of travel I do for work. As a magazine writer, I don’t travel every day, but when I do travel, it’s often to strange places on very short notice. Last year, I spent a weekend on a boat in the canals of Central Florida.
Sunbury-area leaders are concerned about whether owners of the new Columbus Outlets mall is still contributing $16.5 million to improve the Interstate 71 interchange at U.S. 36 and State Route 37. On June 30 the Ohio Department of Transportation submitted a Transportation Review Advisory Council (TRAC) application requesting Tier I status and construction funding for Interstate 71/routes 36-37 interchange modifications that would create a southern interchange near the closed ODOT weigh station on I-71. According to the application, Columbus Outlets LLC’s traffic-impact obligation is for $16.5 million for that project at the discretion of ODOT, based on traffic needs.
As services to mark the centenary of the First World War draw closer, Chatburn and Clitheroe Branches of the Royal British Legion held a special concert and “magical” performance by the military band. As darkness fell, many footsteps trod their path to St Mary’s Parish Church and the pews were soon full – hardly a seat remained in the balcony! The lights dimmed, the Band of the Royal Armoured Corps fanfare blazed out and the concert began. The church resounded to a magical programme of music, from Walking with Heroes, Hymn To The Fallen and so much more.
Sony's PS4 Pro is all about 4K...except when it comes to 4K Blu-rays. That's right, the PS4 Pro doesn't play 4K UHD Blu-rays. Why would Sony make such an obvious omission especially when its competitor's $299 console supports it? So it could push gamers to sign up for its digital 4K movie streaming service called ULTRA. In its own words, here's why Sony cut out the 4K UHD Blu-ray player from the PS4 Pro: "Our feeling is that while physical media continues to be a big part of the games business, we see a trend on video towards streaming.

Scooter Gennett's 9th-inning homer came in his first-ever All-Star Game plate appearance. It looked like Cincinnati Reds All-Star second baseman Scooter Gennett, the National League's leader in batting average at the break, might not even get a chance to bat in his first All-Star Game. Then he stepped into the on-deck circle as a pinch-hitter in the 9th inning, with the National League trailing 5-3 and his Reds and NL teammate, Joey Votto, having committed a costly error on a tough play an inning earlier - one pitch before Jean Segura gave the American League a three-run lead with a three-run homer.
This is concerning Muslim terrorists who are living in non-Muslim countries around the world and who entered these foreign countries of their own free will. Did these countries deny them citizenship because of their religion or country of origin? Did any of those gracious countries attempt to kill them because they didn�t bow down to their accepted religions, or did they allow them to practice their beliefs in peace and tranquility? Many of the terrorists are second- or third-generation citizens of these countries that accepted their forebears. Why do they now plot against their countries of birth?
UNITED NATIONS, April 29, updated -- If this is how the UN will organize its supposed investigation of chemical weapons in Syria, it doesn't look good. Video here. For Ban Ki-moon's 10:05 am “statement” about the probe, the press was told to assemble at 9:15 am at the office of UN Media Accreditation and Liaison Unit on the second floor. But Inner City Press was told that the screening equipment there didn't work, and so headed with the herd down to the lobby. There, camera people were told to get in one line, reporters in another.
The Austrian government’s refusal to sign the UN global compact for migration while holding the EU’s rotating presidency has damaged the EU’s image, progressive forces in the European Parliament said during a debate with Chancellor Sebastian Kurz on Tuesday (15 January). Kurz, who was in Strasbourg to take stock of the Austrian presidency’s achievements, was heavily criticised for his government’s decision not to sign the first intergovernmental agreement to address global migration, even by European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. Juncker argued that the decision was the only exception to an “impressive” presidency.
New Delhi: The Union cabinet on Wednesday allowed 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in single-brand retail without prior government approval and liberalized local sourcing norms— steps that could benefit companies like Swedish furniture retailer IKEA of Sweden AB and fashion house Hennes and Mauritz AB (H&M). Although 100% FDI is already permitted in single-brand retail, only up to 49% was allowed through the so-called automatic route and investment above that needed government approval. Wednesday’s decision smoothens the way for new entrants to start retail operations in the country.
Google is launching the first batch of its Google+ APIs to developers today, allowing them to play around with public data already available on the platform. As far as the game-building aspect goes, Google is providing open source libraries for several game-friendly languages, including Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, Objective C, and .NET. Documentation, terms and policies can be found on the Google Developers site. The Google+ Games platform currently only has a handful of titles available from developer partners including Playdom, Zynga and wooga. Two titles were also developed by Google in-house outfit LabPixies, which was acquired last year.
Filmmaker Kevin Leffler’s first movie, “Shooting Michael Moore,” was set to open in Traverse City, Mich., last month, but the screening got canceled at the last minute. Was it politically motivated censorship? Or simply a prudent safeguard against the possibility of violence against one of Michigan’s own incited by a provocative documentary with an incendiary title? Mr. Leffler, a Michigan native like his subject, isn’t a director by trade, but he has seen enough of Mr. Moore’s movies to know how a cinematic David can sock it to Goliath.
TWO of the safest Tory seats in the country have launched searches for prospective MPs - amid speculation both could select female candidates. Following the deselection of Thirsk and Malton MP Anne McIntosh, the only female Conservative MP in Yorkshire, earlier this year, David Cameron faced a barrage of criticism over the number of women representing the party at Westminster. It is understood party chiefs have given Thirsk and Malton Conservative Association free rein to draw up a shortlist of prospective parliamentary candidates from about 90 applicants, and that the majority of the finalists are women.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's (TRC) final report shone a light on Canada's residential school system, a dark chapter in our history with lasting impacts still felt by Indigenous people today. Ontario is working with Indigenous partners to address the legacy of residential schools, close gaps and remove barriers, create a culturally relevant and responsive justice system, support Indigenous culture, and reconcile relationships with Indigenous peoples. True reconciliation goes beyond the TRC's 'Calls to Action'. The Province will continue to look to Indigenous partners for guidance and leadership.
TAMPA — John Wise always said "hello" to neighbor Kelly Garrison, but it wasn’t until they shared some strawberry daiquiris that he ever got to know her. Barely two minutes after she left his Carrollwood apartment that night, Dec. 30, he heard a scream "like nothing I’ve ever heard before." It was coming from Garrison’s front door. Wise, 54, kicked it in. It was dark, but he saw a man wearing a hoodie and a headlamp pinning Garrison down. Her gasps for air sounded like her last.
NEW DELHI: A London court has issued an arrest warrant against fugitive Nirav Modi, the main accused in the $2 billion PNB scam case, in response to an ED request for his extradition in a money laundering case, officials said Monday. They said the investigative agency has been informed about the issuance of the warrant by the Westminster Magistrate Court against Nirav and he is expected to be put under formal arrest by the local police soon. Nirav will be subsequently brought before the court to secure bail and the legal proceedings for his extradition will begin thereafter, they said.
GAZA CITY - Tawfiq Abu Khoussa is the spokesman for the Palestinian Interior Ministry in Gaza and sits at the epicenter of what should be state power here. But when some of Gaza's many gunmen fired shots at his office, Mr. Khoussa did not seek protection from the Palestinian police or security services. He called on gunmen from his own powerful hamulla --his clan or tribe -- to protect him. Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj, a prominent psychiatrist here, is not surprised. "Who rules Gaza?" he asked. "It's certainly not the central Palestinian Authority."
Pratibha Patil’s Museum: Gifts received by VVIPs from foreign countries can be purchased by them but can they be loaned? Why couldn’t outgoing President Pratibha Patil follow the norms like other VVIPs and buy the gifts she received officially, instead of getting them loaned to her proposed museum? Gifts which VVIPs including President of India receive during their official foreign tours are the property of the nation and are deposited in the government treasury called the Toshakhana. They can be purchased at market value by the VVIPs, if they so wish.

Dancer and choreographer Christopher Rudd, a 1998 high school graduate of New World School of the Arts, has received the first Inspiration Grant from the school’s Alumni Foundation. Rudd, who has his own dance company RuddduR Dance, will use the $1,000 award to help him create Witness, a contemporary ballet inspired by the killings of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Freddie Gray, and the protests that have followed. Rudd, who grew up in Perrine, started dancing via a scholarship program at the Thomas Armour Youth Ballet.
Wantagh - On July 10, iconic rock band Aerosmith played a show at the Nikon at Jones Beach Theater in Wantagh, New York, for a sold-out venue. Acclaimed guitarist Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and The Conspirators served as their opening act for their "Let Rock Rule" tour. They opened their show with "Back in the Saddle" and they followed it up with "Eat The Rich," as the stage was graced in blue and green laser lights. "Love in an Elevator" ended with Steven Tyler and Joe Perry singing together, as Tyler worked the microphone stand.
BASSETERRE – The St. Kitts-Nevis Coast Guard continues to search during their routine patrols for two men feared lost at sea. To date, several search operations at sea and by air have not resulted in any signs of the men or the vessel it is believed they went fishing in. The last large-scale search operation conducted by the Coast Guard was June 14, when a 290-nautical mile creeping line search pattern was used. This method systematically determines where an object might have drifted based on the current. The officers of the Coast Guard searched from East of Nevis to South of Saba.

LONDON — Unilever said on Wednesday that it was conducting a “comprehensive review” of its options after Kraft Heinz withdrew a $143 billion takeover bid for the consumer goods company on Sunday. The combination of the two companies would have created a giant in the packaged food and consumer goods industry, selling a wide range of items, including Heinz ketchup, Oscar Mayer meats, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Dove soap. Kraft Heinz, itself the product of mega-merger, publicly announced on Friday that it had offered to buy Unilever.
Rejoice spoiler-phobes, the great eye in the sky, your Big Brother of choice, the Skynet of real life – Google – has a solution for you. Google has received a new patent on a system that would filter pop culture spoilers on a social media app. It’s too early to know if this would be applied to other networks like Twitter or Facebook, but it’s probably a safe bet to see it pop up on Google+ in the future. I cannot in good conscience include the full explantation of this diagram.
EastEnders has unveiled Louise Mitchell as the mystery culprit who has been blackmailing Keanu Taylor and step-mum Sharon over the last few weeks. Sharon and Keanu have been left panic-stricken after being inundated with a number of unsettling messages from someone who knows about their affair. With no further leads on who could be responsible, Tuesday's (October 23) scenes saw Sharon (Letitia Dean) reach breaking point over the whole situation – especially after an explosive showdown with Keanu's mum, Karen. Karen was horrified to discover that her son had been seeing Sharon in secret and wasted no time in making her feelings known.

With severe storms and heavy rain expected Friday afternoon and evening, Virginia State Police is reminding drivers to be extra cautious on the roads during the possible severe weather. Some school districts in Central Virginia are closing early on Friday due to a severe weather threat. Students told 8News they're shocked their former school resource officer Morley was allegedly part of a racist organization. Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger held her fourth town hall event since being elected, but her first in Henrico County.
Last year's Conan The Barbarian remake was not only one of last year's biggest critical punching bags, but was a total flop at the box office as well. Though it was made for a modest $90 million, the film not only manged to pull in the low sum of $21 million domestically, but was an international disappointment too, pulling in only $48 million globally by the time in left theaters. It's hard to say exactly why the film was unsuccessful, but apparently if you ask Arnold Schwarzenegger the reason was because he wasn't in it - and now he's doing something about that.
US real estate investment fund CPA:17–Global has purchased, for around 60 million euros, a modern logistics center near Kaunas that is leased to Kesko Senukai, the Baltics' leading do-it-yourself retail chain, informed LETA/BNS. CPA:17–Global said in a press release on Thursday that it had acquired the logistic center from Baltic Retail Properties, a real estate investment company owned by Zabolis ir Partneriai Kapitalo Valdymas.

A look back at the sporting year in pictures. Replacement scrum-half Danny Care celebrates one of his two and England’s seven tries in a 61-21 Calcutta Cup win over Scotland at Twickenham. The triumph saw Eddie Jones’ men retain the Six Nations title and a world record-equalling 17th successive Test win. The run, and Grand Slam bid, was ended by Ireland in Dublin the following weekend. Mark Sampson, the England women’s manager, is pictured ahead of Euro 2017. He led the Lionesses to the semi-finals before later being sacked for “inappropriate relationships” prior to his appointment as England women’s boss.
When it comes to asset allocation, stocks vs. bonds, almost every money management book I have read suggests that a person should have a higher percentage of bonds in their portfolio as they grow older. All of those books use age as the major determining factor. One rule is thumb is your age should represent the percentage of bonds you have. If you are 20 years old, you should have 20% in bonds. If you are 30 years old you should have 30% in bonds. So on a so forth. I think this is ridiculous.
Montebello’s bus drivers and other transit workers are getting their first pay raise since December 2016 but in order to get the 11 % raise over three years, they’re going to begin paying nearly their equivalent amount of of retirement costs. Only the 3 percent raise, which goes into effect immediately is a real increase in pay. Employees will receive a 4 % pay raise in 2020 and 2021 but also begin paying the same amount in retirement the city now pays. A typical driver in three years will be paying $3,600 n retirement costs.
Who needs in-house skills when you’ve got the cloud? Jetstar CIO Stephen Tame sees his suppliers as he sees his investment stocks - a balanced spread of risk, with some paying bigger dividends than others. Tame revealed today that the budget airline operates with just five full-time IT staff, focused almost exclusively on managing a number of outsourcing partners including IBM (check-in/kiosk), Sonnet (desktops), Zensar (Operations app development and BPO), Telstra (telecommunications), iGate (Engineering app development) and CapGemini (Data Warehouse).
The botnet drives clicks through 202 sites for advertiser cash. Security researchers have discovered a botnet that is stealing millions of dollars per month from advertisers. The botnet does so by simulating click-throughs on display ads hosted on at least 202 websites. Revealed and dubbed "Chameleon" by the Web analytics firm spider.io because of its ability to fool advertisers' behavior-tracking algorithms, the botnet is the first found to use display advertisements to generate fraudulent income for its masters. While in many respects the botnet simulates human activity on webpages to fool countermeasures to clickfraud, it generates random mouse clicks and mouse pointer traces across pages.
You may be familiar with the aggressive behavior of the northern mockingbird, found throughout most of the United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean. A new study implies that less-than-lethal lead concentrations might make that behavior worse. While not all city dwellers realize it, we share our environs with hundreds of wild avian species, from migratory warblers just passing through to the starlings and mockingbirds pecking at our trash. But urban areas also generate pollution that can harm animals in surprising ways. A team of researchers has now found one more obscure consequence.
The Home Office is refusing to reveal how it will use data collected from EU citizens applying to remain in the UK after Brexit. EU citizens could be deterred from applying to remain in the UK after Brexit due to fears over how the UK government will use information collected during the application process. The Home Office has refused repeated requests from privacy and transparency campaigners to reveal information about the new settled status scheme for EU citizens living in the UK. Around 3 million EU citizens currently live in the country. Campaigners suggest government secrecy about the issue could be breaking the law.
Disney theme parks are well known for being the place where the magic happens, but there are many secrets that help staff to achieve this. Since their inception, the parks have hidden rooms and secret menus that all add to the mystique of the place, for example, 200 cats are allowed to roam at night to catch mice and there are special smells pumped into the air to make guests feel happy. Here, Kenwood Travel has rounded up some of the best secrets and facts from the Disney theme parks. Ever notice that you never seem to see a Disney employee wandering around the park?
Ex-Intel engineer Maher 'Mike' Mofeid Hawash has pleaded guilty to one of three charges that he conspired to aid and abet the Taliban. Hawash, 38, admitted that he travelled to Afghanistan in 2001 with the intention of fighting against the US' invasion of that country. Apparently he got as far as China but failed to get into Afghanistan because he was denied a visa to cross Pakistan. He then returned to the US. The US Department of Justice arrested Hawash last March and was finally indicted in April after being held without charge for several weeks.

Senate Democrats had the opportunity to recruit a murderers' row of popular and tested candidates with proven fundraising abilities in a handful of key states up for election next year as they seek a path back to the majority. But virtually all of those candidates have taken themselves out of the running, either because they see a bigger prize on the horizon — the White House — or because the allure of serving in the world’s greatest deliberative body is no longer what it once was. In spite of lobbying from allies in Washington and at home, Montana Gov.
Thierry Henry and John Terry are reportedly among the contenders for the Aston Villa manager's job following Steve Bruce's sacking on Wednesday. Bruce had come under increasing pressure after Villa's poor start to the season and had a cabbage hurled at him during Tuesday night's home draw with Preston. Former Arsenal striker Henry, currently assistant manager to Roberto Martinez at Belgium, and Terry, who spent last season playing at Villa, have been linked with the job. Sam Allardyce and Brentford manager Dean Smith have also been touted by bookmakers as Villa mull over their fifth permanent appointment in less than five years.
Did Netscape jump the gun with new browser? Long heckled for being late to market with its new browser, Netscape Communications is now the target of critics who say the company jumped the gun in releasing the browser this month. Netscape fans breathed a sigh of relief two weeks ago with the official launch of Netscape's first major browser release in more than two years. The browser's 32-month gestation, marked by regularly revised due dates, gave what many saw as a critical advantage to rival Microsoft in establishing its dominance of the browser market.
VOLUNTARY water restrictions were passed at the Muswellbrook Shire Council (MSC) meeting on Tuesday, in an attempt to save resources for drought-affected farmers. The decision passed unanimously, but the MSC wants to make it clear there is no immediate lack of water in the region. “Muswellbrook Shire Council does not have an imminent water shortage it is conscious of...[we] encourage the community to use water effectively and sustainably,” a council spokesperson said. They cited the upcoming bushfire season, which is expected to be longer and more devastating than usual, as another reason for the voluntary regulations.
PRODUCER. Singing entrepreneur Hildi Montesclaros of the Bio-Troff Herbal Products fame is definitely joining the colorful world of showbiz by becoming a movie producer. This I personally gathered from Ate Ging, as she is fondly called, during a meeting with line producer Anne Angus. I also learned that a multi-awarded screenplay writer and an American filmmaker, whose names I can’t reveal as of now, will be involved in the production. DIRECTOR. But they told me that Peach Caparas, daughter of noted film director Carlo J. Caparas, will meg Ate Ging’s debut production.

Beets are harvested from late spring to early winter and keep for weeks. Beets are good for you and have a long growing season, so we’re always looking for new ways to enjoy these colorful root veggies.

Jan Skoyles writes: Back in the 1980s any activity in the Chinese economy would have failed to interest anyone in the Western world. Back then they were only a seventh of the size of the US and their economic policies would have barely registered. Since the 1980s China has seen an impressive transition from an emerging to an almost fully emerged economy. In just one generation’s time the Chinese economy will grow to $123 trillion – three times more than the entire world output of the year 2000. Robert Fogel predicts that by 2040 the Chinese economy will dwarf that of the US by growing to 3 times its size.
Advertised as “the best double bill of the fall” by The State Theatre, the Drive-By Truckers performed with the Felice Brothers Wednesday night to an audience of bearded boozers and dedicated bros. On a night full of working-class Southern rock, the Drive-By Truckers put on a sharp and riveting show that far outshined their openers. Bred in upstate New York but formed in Brooklyn, The Felice Brothers were so close to being good. The band inhabits the increasingly popular belt between indie and country. It’s a genre that requires technical skill and soulful nostalgia, both of which they convey in their studio recordings.

He was in the airline business. He was American. And he knew his golf. You know, he said, the American golfer who makes a first foray across the Atlantic typically goes to Scotland first. Then the golfer goes to Ireland. This, of course, begged the question: why? I’ll attempt to answer, but first an admission. I am biased because I am from Ireland and much of my youth was spent of golf courses there, one in particular, where my dad and other family members enjoyed membership.
Palm Springs has found itself in a position that is the envy of small cities across America: its airport has captured the undivided attention of the airlines.

Vets at the humane society anesthetized the five squirrels so they could work on separating the critters without getting scratched or bitten up. It ultimately only took 20 minutes to free the squirrels after snipping away at the plastic and grass and shaving the hair from their tails. As weird as it sounds, squirrel-knot situations like these seem to happen fairly often. “[One of our volunteers] has seen this before, but we’ve never had five tangled like this,” said Speed. We actually reported on a similar situation in Nebraska earlier this year, even though it was with fox squirrels rather than eastern greys.
Thousands and possibly tens of thousands of mourners, many of them black-clad young women carrying roses, overwhelmed security forces today at Tehran’s largest cemetery to gather around the grave of Neda Agha-Soltan, the young woman whose videotaped shooting at a June 20 demonstration stunned the world. ….Afterward, the crowds began to gather in front of central Tehran’s Grand Mossala mosque, defying authorities who had prohibited the use of the site. Protesters chanted slogans as they rode the subway to the venue, setting the stage for more clashes as dusk approached. It’s an ominous moment for the government.
It's not easy to know what to make of the Apple Watch so far. On one hand, it's almost certainly the most successful smartwatch ever made. On the other, that's still like saying you're the tallest person in a room where it's just you and Tom Cruise. Smartwatches haven't taken over the world the way Apple (or Google, or Pebble) may have hoped. That's at least in part because no one seems to have figured out what, exactly, a smartwatch is supposed to be for. Notifications? Texting? Fitness things?
Now that the third quarter is underway for middle and high school students, it is time for parents and students to sit down and have “the talk” about how school is going so far. Together, they can discover what is going well for the student, as well as what could be improved. Besides looking at grades, which may be indicators of stronger or weaker areas, parents should keep in mind what goes into a “grade”. Teachers often have different categories worth different percentages that combine to make a number, which translates into grades.
Destiney Passmore and the Menendez softball team are one win away from a state playoff berth. The Falcons used a solid pitching performance and the game-winning RBI from Passmore to stun second-seeded Ponte Vedra 2-1 in District 4-4A quarterfinals on Monday night. Menendez advanced to today's 5 p.m. semifinal against third-seeded Palatka, and will be in the state playoffs for just the second time in program history with a win.
