Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism, though usually most classify up to homotopy equivalence.Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems, using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible. Algebraic topology, for example, allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a free group is again a free group.Main branches of algebraic topologyBelow are some of the main areas studied in algebraic topology:Homotopy groupsIn mathematics, homotopy groups are used in algebraic topology to classify topological spaces.|1

"Bdellovibrio is a genus of Gram-negative, obligate aerobic bacterium. One of the more notable characteristics of this genus is that members can prey upon other Gram-negative bacteria and feed on the biopolymers, e.g. proteins and nucleic acids, of their hosts. They have two lifestyles: a host-dependent, highly mobile phase, the ""attack phase"", in which they form ""bdelloplasts"" in their host bacteria; and a slow-growing, irregularly shaped, host-independent form.Bdellovibrio bacteriovorusThe most well studied of these is Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, which is found almost exclusively in host dependent growth in nature."|1

In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) establishes that, in many situations, when independent random variables are summed up, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a bell curve) even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed.

Nature versus nurture is a long-standing debate in biology about the balance between two competing factors which determine fate : the genetic potential of a cell for growth and the environment of that cell. As cells age or are damaged by aging, the genetic potential for growth can be altered, while the external environment, in general, remains constant. This balance can be influenced by several factors which vary across environments, such as changes in temperature, food and oxygen levels, and physical activity. It is generally thought that one's genetics are more or less influential across a wide range of conditions compared to an environment.|0

Optical rotation, also known as polarization rotation or circular birefringence, is the rotation of the orientation of the plane of polarization about the optical axis of linearly polarized light as it travels through certain materials. Circular birefringence and circular dichroism are the manifestations of optical activity. Optical activity occurs only in chiral materials, those lacking microscopic mirror symmetry. Unlike other sources of birefringence which alter a beam's state of polarization, optical activity can be observed in fluids. This can include gases or solutions of chiral molecules such as sugars, molecules with helical secondary structure such as some proteins, and also chiral liquid crystals.|1

Some of the differences were: The MOVE from SR instruction is now privileged (it may only be executed in supervisor mode). This means that the 68010 meets Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements. Because the 68000 offers an unprivileged MOVE from SR, it does not meet them.|1
"In software quality assurance , performance testing is in general a testing practice performed to determine how a system performs, in comparison with pre-defined performance criteria. There are two types of software testing, functional and performance (also called throughput or scalability) testing, although the two types of tests are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The term ""performance"" as applied to software is often loosely used to refer to either or both types of testing. In the context of software testing, throughput or scalability testing can be defined as ""tests performed to determine the maximum amount of work a system can perform in a given time period."|0

"In mathematics , open sets are a generalization of open intervals in the real line . In a metric space—that is, a Hausdorff space—open sets are precisely those open subsets that are Borel measurable. There are numerous examples of sets which are Borel, but not open. The famous Cantor set is one. Open sets are an important and useful concept in many contexts. For example,

open subsets of the real line are intervals . The set of integers is countable. Therefore, the set of open subsets of the real line is uncountable."|0

In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the abstract notion of a limit captures the essential properties of universal constructions such as products, pullbacks and inverse limits. The dual notion of a colimit generalizes constructions such as disjoint unions, direct sums, coproducts, pushouts and direct limits.Limits and colimits, like the strongly related notions of universal properties and adjoint functors, exist at a high level of abstraction. In order to understand them, it is helpful to first study the specific examples these concepts are meant to generalize.Definition Limits and colimits in a category  are defined by means of diagrams in .|1
