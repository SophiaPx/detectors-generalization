"An inverse multiplexer ( often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX ) allows a data stream to be broken into multiple data streams, and recombined later into one. In other words, the data stream is ""divided and conquered"". This makes it a useful component in the design of high-bandwidth communication systems which can transmit information across multiple channels, which can all be modulated in the same way. In telephony , an IMUX is used to convert 30 channels into 1 channel. The multiplexed channels can be either T1 (24 voice channels) or E1 (30 voice channels.)"|0

"Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton 's third law . When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction, an equal but opposite force acts in the direction opposite of motion. The magnitude of the force, F, acting on a body of mass m is given by: F = m.a, where: a = acceleration of body m = mass (kg) F = force acting on the body, m x a = 1/2.m.a2 = constant of proportionality. This quantity is often taken as the definition of the ""moment"" of a force about a point."|0

In celestial mechanics , escape velocity or escape speed is the minimum speed needed for a free , non-propelled object in outer space , such as a planet , to escape from the gravitational attraction of a second body such as a star. Gravitational attraction is proportional to the inverse-square of distance , which means the escape velocity of an object is proportional to the square root of its mass, and to the inverse-square of the distance from its center of mass. If the object is at rest in the surface of a gravitating mass, the gravitational force will act on it perpendicularly and in the opposite direction to its velocity.|0
"The oxidation state, or oxidation number, is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to different atoms were fully ionic. It describes the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state may be positive, negative or zero. While fully ionic bonds are not found in nature, many bonds exhibit strong ionicity, making oxidation state a useful predictor of charge.The oxidation state of an atom does not represent the ""real"" formal charge on that atom, or any other actual atomic property."|1

The raven paradox, also known as Hempel's paradox, Hempel's ravens, or rarely the paradox of indoor ornithology, is a paradox arising from the question of what constitutes evidence for a statement. Observing objects that are neither black nor ravens may formally increase the likelihood that all ravens are black even though, intuitively, these observations are unrelated.This problem was proposed by the logician Carl Gustav Hempel in the 1940s to illustrate a contradiction between inductive logic and intuition.Paradox Hempel describes the paradox in terms of the hypothesis: (1) All ravens are black.|1

Metaphone is a phonetic algorithm, published by Lawrence Philips in 1990, for indexing words by their English pronunciation. It fundamentally improves on the Soundex algorithm by using information about variations and inconsistencies in English spelling and pronunciation to produce a more accurate encoding, which does a better job of matching words and names which sound similar. As with Soundex, similar-sounding words should share the same keys. Metaphone is available as a built-in operator in a number of systems.Philips later produced a new version of the algorithm, which he named Double Metaphone.|1

"The Novikov self-consistency principle, also known as the Novikov self-consistency conjecture and Larry Niven's law of conservation of history, is a principle developed by Russian physicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov in the mid-1980s. Novikov intended it to solve the problem of paradoxes in time travel, which is theoretically permitted in certain solutions of general relativity that contain what are known as closed timelike curves. The principle asserts that if an event exists that would cause a paradox or any ""change"" to the past whatsoever, then the probability of that event is zero."|1

An inverse multiplexer (often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX) allows a data stream to be broken into multiple lower data rate communication links. An inverse multiplexer differs from a demultiplexer because the multiple output streams from the former stay inter-related, whereas those from the latter are unrelated. An inverse multiplexer is the opposite of a multiplexer  in that it divides one high-speed link into multiple low-speed links, whereas a multiplexer combines multiple low-speed links into one high-speed link.This provides an end to end connection of several times the data rate available on each of the low rate data links.|1

"The unexpected hanging paradox or surprise test paradox is a paradox about a person's expectations about the timing of a future event which they are told will occur at an unexpected time. The paradox is variously applied to a prisoner's hanging, or a surprise school test. It was first introduced to the public in Martin Gardner's March 1963 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American magazine.There is no consensus on its precise nature and consequently a canonical resolution has not been agreed on. Logical analyses focus on ""truth values"", for example by identifying it as paradox of self-reference."|1

The Burrows–Wheeler transform ( BWT , also called block-sorting compression ) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters, followed by runs of spaces and tabs . The BWT is then used as the basis for an efficient search algorithm for common subsequences that can be compressed to fixed-length codes. It is also used for approximate matching of large strings , in which case runs of equal characters in the strings are replaced by a single character (the minimum common character). This is an example of a compression method using a lossless compression algorithm. BWTs also play a role in DNA analysis and DNA sequence analysis.|0

Theories of political behavior , as an aspect of political science , attempt to quantify and explain the influences that cause people to choose particular political ideologies and political behaviors. Demographers use population theory to explain population size and structure. Population theory can be divided into two categories—macro and micro—with the division being made on the size of the population. Macro-level population theory examines larger groups, while micro-level population theories examine smaller groups, such as individuals and households. In macro-level theory, a population is understood to be the collection of people of a specific nationality that inhabits the same territory.|0

The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one of the other positive integers. It has been proven for some cases, but it has not been proven for all positive integers, including the value of 1729 (the number of steps it takes to get from 1729 to 1). So, how is it possible to use the number 1729 and the Collatz conjecture to make a candy cane? You simply need a way to transform one candy cane into another. Candy canes are made up of sugar and starches.|0

"A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura (literally without tail in Ancient Greek). The oldest fossil ""proto-frog"" Triadobatrachus is known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their split from other amphibians may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforest. Frogs account for around 88% of extant amphibian species."|1
A monopropellant rocket ( or `` monochemical rocket '' ) is a rocket that uses a single chemical as its fuel. The word mono- refers to its single reaction mass. The most common of these is hydrazine. Other chemicals used for monopropellants are hydrazinium perchlorate, nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Most modern rockets are monopropellant rockets, including those of the Space Shuttle , the Saturn V , the Saturn I, and the Saturn I. This has made them more popular than hybrid or bipropellant rockets, which are much less efficient. Monopropellants also have the advantage of being stored at atmospheric pressure, which makes them easier to store.|0

The oxidation state , or oxidation number , is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to other atoms were broken and all of its electrons stripped. However, atoms rarely have a full set of valence electrons in the outermost electron shell , which makes their overall oxidation state somewhat less definite. If an atom can gain or lose electrons to attain the lowest possible oxidation state that it can, it is said to exhibit oxidizing behavior. On the other hand, if an atom's electrons tend to be lost to attain the highest possible oxidation state, it is said to exhibit reductive behavior.|0

The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. It  concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.The conjecture is named after mathematician Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate.|1

All molecules and ions with a free pair of electrons or at least one pi bond can act as nucleophiles. Because nucleophiles donate electrons, they are Lewis bases. Nucleophilic describes the affinity of a nucleophile to bond with positively charged atomic nuclei. Nucleophilicity, sometimes referred to as nucleophile strength, refers to a substance's nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the affinity of atoms. Neutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohols and water are named solvolysis.|1

"In celestial mechanics, escape velocity or escape speed is the minimum speed needed for a free, non-propelled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a primary body, thus reaching an infinite distance from it. It is typically stated as an ideal speed, ignoring atmospheric friction. Although the term ""escape velocity"" is common, it is more accurately described as a speed than a velocity because it is independent of direction; the escape speed increases with the mass of the primary body and decreases with the distance from the primary body."|1

"In the philosophy of mathematics, the abstraction of actual infinity involves the acceptance (if the axiom of infinity is included) of infinite entities as given, actual and completed objects. These might include the set of natural numbers, extended real numbers, transfinite numbers, or even an infinite sequence of rational numbers. Actual infinity is to be contrasted with potential infinity, in which a non-terminating process (such as ""add 1 to the previous number"") produces a sequence with no last element, and where each individual result is finite and is achieved in a finite number of steps."|1

A radionuclide (radioactive nuclide, radioisotope or radioactive isotope) is a nuclide that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. This excess energy can be used in one of three ways: emitted from the nucleus as gamma radiation; transferred to one of its electrons to release it as a conversion electron; or used to create and emit a new particle (alpha particle or beta particle) from the nucleus. During those processes, the radionuclide is said to undergo radioactive decay. These emissions are considered ionizing radiation because they are powerful enough to liberate an electron from another atom.|1

In economics, inflation refers to a general progressive increase in prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. The opposite of inflation is deflation, a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualised percentage change in a general price index.Prices will not all increase at the same rates. Attaching a representative value to a set of prices is an instance of the index number problem.|1

"A seal is a device for making an impression in wax, clay, paper, or some other medium, including an embossment on paper, and is also the impression thus made. The original purpose was to authenticate a document, or to prevent interference with a package or envelope by applying a seal which had to be broken to open the container (hence the modern English verb ""to seal"", which implies secure closing without an actual wax seal).The seal-making device is also referred to as the seal matrix or die; the imprint it creates as the seal impression (or, more rarely, the sealing)."|1
"Fermat's principle, also known as the principle of least time, is the link between ray optics and wave optics. In its original ""strong"" form, Fermat's principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time. In order to be true in all cases, this statement must be weakened by replacing the ""least"" time with a time that is ""stationary"" with respect to variations of the path — so that a deviation in the path causes, at most, a second-order change in the traversal time."|1

Dementia manifests as a set of related symptoms, which usually surface when the brain is damaged by injury or disease. The symptoms involve progressive impairments in memory, thinking, and behavior, which negatively impact a person's ability to function and carry out everyday activities. Aside from memory impairment and a disruption in thought patterns, the most common symptoms include emotional problems, difficulties with language, and decreased motivation. The symptoms may be described as occurring in a continuum over several stages. Consciousness is not affected. Dementia ultimately has a significant effect on the individual, caregivers, and relationships in general.|1
The Viking program consisted of a pair of identical American space probes, Viking 1 and Viking 2, which landed on Mars in 1976. Each spacecraft was composed of two main parts: an orbiter designed to photograph the surface of Mars from orbit, and a lander designed to study the planet from the surface. The orbiters also served as communication relays for the landers once they touched down.The Viking program grew from NASA's earlier, even more ambitious, Voyager Mars program, which was not related to the successful Voyager deep space probes of the late 1970s.|1
"Liberation theology is a Christian theological approach emphasizing the liberation of the oppressed. In certain contexts, it engages socio-economic analyses, with ""social concern for the poor and political liberation for oppressed peoples."" In other contexts, it addresses other forms of inequality, such as race or caste.Liberation theology is best known in the Latin American context, especially within Catholicism in the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council, where it became the political praxis of theologians such as Gustavo Gutiérrez, Leonardo Boff, and Jesuits Juan Luis Segundo and Jon Sobrino, who popularized the phrase ""preferential option for the poor""."|1
An anti-tank guided missile (ATGM), anti-tank missile, anti-tank guided weapon (ATGW) or anti-armor guided weapon is  a guided missile primarily designed to hit and destroy heavily armored military vehicles. ATGMs range in size from shoulder-launched weapons, which can be transported by a single soldier, to larger tripod-mounted weapons, which require a squad or team to transport and fire, to vehicle and aircraft mounted missile systems.Earlier man-portable anti-tank weapons like anti-tank rifles and magnetic anti-tank mines, generally had very short range, sometimes on the order of metres or tens of metres.|1

"The unexpected hanging paradox or surprise test paradox is a paradox about a person 's expectations about the timing of future events. Paradox is an oxymoron, which is a figure of speech containing two contradictory or diametrically opposite ideas that may seem logical but are actually self-defeating; e.g. ""You cannot go back and change the past, but if you could, I'd kiss it all good bye"". The name comes from the Latin prefix paradox-, meaning beyond or beyond the fact, from para, outside of, and dox, thought."|0
"Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to femininity and masculinity and differentiating between them . Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex(male, female) , gender-role , gender identity , sexual orientation , social gender role , and many other traits . Biological sex is a person's classification as male or female, based on their sexual differentiation. It is the genetic and anatomic characteristics that are considered the ""default female"" or ""default male"" with respect to sexual differentiation in a human being. In humans, sex is determined by the combination of sex chromosomes and a sex hormones ."|0
In philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own, properties or behaviors which emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole.Emergence plays a central role in theories of integrative levels and of complex systems. For instance, the phenomenon of life as studied in biology is an emergent property of chemistry, and many psychological phenomena are known to emerge from underlying neurobiological processes.In philosophy, theories that emphasize emergent properties have been called emergentism.In philosophyPhilosophers often understand emergence as a claim about the etiology of a system's properties.|1

"Thermonuclear fusion is the process of atoms combining or “fusing” together with huge amounts of heat. There are two forms of thermonuclear fusion: uncontrolled, in which the resulting energy is released in an uncontrolled manner, as it is in thermonuclear weapons (""hydrogen bombs"") and in most stars; and controlled, where the fusion reactions take place in an environment allowing some or all of the energy released to be harnessed for constructive purposes.Temperature requirementsTemperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles, so by heating the material it will gain energy."|1
Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents. Legal adoptions permanently transfer all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parents to the adoptive parents.Unlike guardianship or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption, while others used less formal means (notably contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of filiation).|1

A mass driver or electromagnetic catapult is a proposed method of non-rocket spacelaunch which would use a linear motor to launch a vehicle into space from a fixed location. Mass driver systems are commonly assumed to be very expensive and would only be practical from locations with very low gravity, but they offer many advantages for a spacecraft, in particular allowing it to take off vertically (or near-vertically). The term was originally coined in the mid-1960s by Robert G. Sproul who proposed a version using a tape-wound linear motor, but it refers more generally to a system in which linear electric motors are used to launch spacecraft or payloads.|0
Zooarchaeology (sometimes incorrectly archaeozoology), also known as faunal analysis, is a branch of archaeology that studies remains of animals from archaeological sites. Faunal remains are the items left behind when an animal dies. These include bones, shells, hair, chitin, scales, hides, proteins and DNA. Of these items, bones and shells are the ones that occur most frequently at archaeological sites where faunal remains can be found. Most of the time, a majority of these faunal remains do not survive. They often decompose or break because of various circumstances.|1
"In quantum mechanics, counterfactual definiteness (CFD) is the ability to speak ""meaningfully"" of the definiteness of the results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e., the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured). The term ""counterfactual definiteness"" is used in discussions of physics calculations, especially those related to the phenomenon called quantum entanglement and those related to the Bell inequalities. In such discussions ""meaningfully"" means the ability to treat these unmeasured results on an equal footing with measured results in statistical calculations."|1

Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells . Cell division is a normal function of cells that are capable of growth and regeneration. The process by which this is achieved is known as the cell cycle. There are several types of cell division: mitosis, meiosis, and mitotic cell divisions. In all three types of cell division, the two new daughter cells (each called a daughter cell) have an identical genetic constitution (genotype). During mitosis, the nucleus of each daughter cell receives the same chromosome number as the parent cell.|0
The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and most animals including a few fish, and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the air and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing.|1

"Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel  (colloquial: Infinite Hotel Paradox or Hilbert's Hotel) is a thought experiment which illustrates a counterintuitive property of infinite sets. It is demonstrated that a fully occupied hotel with infinitely many rooms may still accommodate additional guests, even infinitely many of them, and this process may be repeated infinitely often. The idea was introduced by David Hilbert in a 1924 lecture ""Über das Unendliche"", reprinted in , and was popularized through George Gamow's 1947 book One Two Three... Infinity.The paradoxConsider a hypothetical hotel with a countably infinite number of rooms, all of which are occupied."|1
Mystery religions , mystery cults , sacred mysteries or simply mysteries , were religious schools of the Greco-Roman world for both men and women. They were secretive, and some of their knowledge was closely held by priests and was considered too sacred to be publicly revealed. The mystery religions may be considered a form of esoteric , and they seem to have had more of an impact in Greece, Italy and Egypt, but there are also indications of them in Rome. Mystery cults were practiced in several ways. Mystery rituals , which were usually secret, may have been used for prospective initiates.|0
Humour ( Commonwealth English ) or humor ( American English ) is the tendency of experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement. [1] It is not strictly an emotion, but a response to other aesthetic stimuli such as words (particularly verbal or written comedy), actions, physical stimuli, and objects. Humour is a part of the unconscious with a broad psychological basis in conflict resolution and resolution of social hierarchies (see peer pressure). The ultimate goal of most humour is to amuse, though the effect of comedy is greatly affected by its context and the viewer's reaction.|0

Catalase is a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen ( such as bacteria , plants , fungi, animals, enzymes are protein- based catalysts used to accelerate the rates of many types of chemical reactions). In enzyme kinetic studies, substrate concentration is one of the two variables that can be varied, the other being enzyme concentration. For example, enzyme kinetics might be used to measure enzyme affinity to the substrate and how much substrate is needed to saturate the enzyme or to measure how fast the enzyme cleaves its substrate.|0

Frame Relay is a standardized wide area network ( WAN ) technology that specifies the physical and data link layers of the network. Frame Relay is used primarily as a WAN protocol, to connect LANs in different locations. Frame Relay provides guaranteed bandwidth but only guarantees the frame delivery and not the actual data transfer. This is the data link layer or physical layer for the frame relay. A frame is simply a bundle of data bytes, that is, a collection of bits. When a frame travels across a communications link, a data link layer at the destination recognizes a frame by looking at the frame's header.|0

In commutative algebra , the prime spectrum ( or simply the spectrum ) of a ring R is the set of prime ideals (rational numbers) of R , i.e. R/pR where primes pR are the irreducible non-zero elements of the prime spectrum. There is a ring homomorphism ζ from the ring of quotients Z /nZ to 1+nZ, and this is the quotient of the prime spectrum. This gives a commutative algebraic structure to the prime spectrum. The quotient space 1+nZ /nZ has the discrete topology. The prime spectrum thus is a locally compact commutative topological space.|0

Stanford developed the design with the intention that it be made available under open source licenses so that anyone could implement it. The SPARC architecture became one of the standards in the computer industry for high-performance microcomputers in the years between the 1980s and the 1990s, but by 2005 was in decline and in 2010 it was displaced by the Intel Itanium.|0
"Courtesan, in modern usage, is a euphemism for a ""kept"" mistress or prostitute, particularly one with wealthy, powerful, or influential clients. The term historically referred to a courtier, a person who attended the court of a monarch or other powerful person.History In European feudal society, the court was the centre of government as well as the residence of the monarch, and social and political life were often completely mixed together. Prior to the Renaissance, courtesans served to convey information to visiting dignitaries, when servants could not be trusted. In Renaissance Europe, courtiers played an extremely important role in upper-class society."|1

Psilocybin  is a naturally occurring psychedelic prodrug compound produced by more than 200 species of fungi. The most potent are members of the genus Psilocybe, such as P. azurescens, P. semilanceata, and P. cyanescens, but psilocybin has also been isolated from about a dozen other genera. Psilocybin is itself biologically inactive but is quickly converted by the body to psilocin, which has mind-altering effects similar, in some aspects, to those of LSD, mescaline, and DMT. In general, the effects include euphoria, visual and mental hallucinations, changes in perception, a distorted sense of time, and perceived spiritual experiences.|1

"The Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT, also called block-sorting compression) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters. This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by techniques such as move-to-front transform and run-length encoding. More importantly, the transformation is reversible, without needing to store any additional data except the position of the first original character. The BWT is thus a ""free"" method of improving the efficiency of text compression algorithms, costing only some extra computation."|1

"The Maunder Minimum, also known as the ""prolonged sunspot minimum"", was a period around 1645 to 1715 during which sunspots became exceedingly rare. During a 28-year period (1672–1699) within the minimum, observations revealed fewer than 50 sunspots. This contrasts with the typical 40,000–50,000 sunspots seen in modern times over a similar timespan.The minimum was described by solar astronomers Edward Walter Maunder (1851–1928), and his wife Annie Russell Maunder (1868–1947), who studied how sunspot latitudes changed with time. Two papers were published in Edward Maunder's name in 1890 and 1894, and he cited earlier papers written by Gustav Spörer."|1

"Isotope separation is the process of concentrating specific isotopes of a chemical element by removing other isotopes. The use of the nuclides produced is varied. The largest variety is used in research (e.g. in chemistry where atoms of ""marker"" nuclide are used to figure out reaction mechanisms). By tonnage, separating natural uranium into enriched uranium and depleted uranium is the largest application. In the following text, mainly the uranium enrichment is considered. This process is crucial in the manufacture of uranium fuel for nuclear power plants, and is also required for the creation of uranium-based nuclear weapons."|1

A brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. These can be further classified as primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which most commonly have spread from tumors located outside the brain, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the size of the tumor and the part of the brain that is involved. Where symptoms exist, they may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes.|1

In quantum mechanics , counterfactual definiteness ( CFD ) is the ability to speak `` meaningfully '' of the definiteness ( or lack thereof ) of a quantum state at a particular point in time. What does it mean for a computer to be quantum? For one, it might have the ability to encrypt data in an impregnable manner. But it could also have the capability to carry out certain calculations in less time than a classical computer would. This is the idea behind quantum computers—devices that utilize the strange properties of quantum mechanics to make certain calculations much more quickly than is possible with traditional computers.|0

A hybrid-propellant rocket is a rocket with a rocket motor that uses rocket propellants in two different phases : one liquid and another one in the form of pressurized gas. Liquid propellants have the advantages of being denser, and hence more efficient than gaseous propellants, and of being storable in the liquid phase at standard temperatures and pressures, which allows their manufacturing at high yields. The problem with a hybrid rocket is that the combustion chamber is more complex than in a monopropellant rocket and is potentially more vulnerable to failure. The complexity of the hybrid combustion chamber limits the number of possible materials for the combustion chamber.|0

The Novikov self-consistency principle , also known as the Novikov self-consistency conjecture and Larry Niven 's law of conservation of stupidity, is a mathematical problem in the theory of dynamics and probability. A set of probability distributions is said to be consistent if the expected value of any linear combination of them is zero. It is well known that this is true if and only if the expectation of each component distribution is zero. However, in general, a linear combination of distributions need not be the linear combination of the expected values of the distributions.|0
Garnets are a group of silicate minerals that have been used since the Bronze Age as gemstones and abrasives.All species of Garnets possess similar optical properties and a similar hardness, but differ in chemical composition and crystal form. The different species are not always readily distinguished by gemmologists and some authorities do not distinguish them, while others distinguish up to seven or more different species. Garnets have been known since antiquity in India, Africa and the Middle East and are found in many places. They are widely distributed and occur in many different colors ranging from red to purple to yellow-green to blue and colorless.|0

In linguistics , an adjective ( abbreviated ) is a word that modifies a noun or noun phrase or describes a quality of an object, person, or place. In other languages that do not have comparable adjectives, the word may be derived from a noun by adding a descriptive suffix (e.g. in Russian -ый and -еный ), or, in some languages, by changing the form of a noun by means of inflection or derivation. In such languages adjectives are usually classified as substantives or as an independent word class. Adjectives are one of the traditional parts of speech.|0

The Lhotshampa or Lhotsampa people are a heterogeneous Bhutanese people of Nepalese descent . `` Lhotshampa '' , which means `` those from the south-facing slope, '' is a geographical designation. The name Lhotsampa (or Lho Tsampa) was given to the Nepalese migrants in 1989 as a part of Bhutanese national campaign. The Lhotshampa people have been present in Bhutan since 1860, when the Bhutanese Government allowed them to move into the country after an agreement was reached between the two governments. The migrants came to Bhutan to cultivate the fertile lands along the river valleys and to take up work opportunities.|0
The subset sum problem ( SSP ) is a decision problem in computer science . In its most general formulation it takes the form of: Given numbers and a positive integer k, does there exist some subset of numbers such that k is the sum of the elements of that subset ? The subset sum problem is NP-hard . In 1968, Donald Knuth  proposed an algorithm to solve the subset sum problem in linear time , and later showed that it is the best possible. He also introduced the subset-sum problem as the first NP-hard problem in the seminal 1968 paper .|0
Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle. In eukaryotes, there are two distinct types of cell division; a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell (mitosis), and a reproductive cell division, whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce haploid gametes (meiosis). In cell biology, mitosis (/maɪˈtoʊsɪs/) is a part of the cell cycle, in which, replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei.|1

The heart is a muscular organ in most animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system. The pumped blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the body, while carrying metabolic waste such as carbon dioxide to the lungs. In humans, the heart is approximately the size of a closed fist and is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest.In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles.|1
Catalase is a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen (such as bacteria, plants, and animals) which catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. It is a very important enzyme in protecting the cell from oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Catalase has one of the highest turnover numbers of all enzymes; one catalase molecule can convert millions of hydrogen peroxide molecules to water and oxygen each second.Catalase is a tetramer of four polypeptide chains, each over 500 amino acids long. It contains four iron-containing heme groups that allow the enzyme to react with hydrogen peroxide.|1

Crocodiles (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. The term crocodile is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae) among other extinct taxa.Although they appear similar, crocodiles, alligators and the gharial belong to separate biological families. The gharial, with its narrow snout, is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators.|1
Hex is a two player abstract strategy board game in which players attempt to connect opposite sides of a hexagonal board. Hex was invented by mathematician and poet Piet Hein in 1942 and independently by John Nash in 1948.It is traditionally played on an 11×11 rhombus board, although 13×13 and 19×19 boards are also popular. Each player is assigned a pair of opposite sides of the board which they must try to connect by taking turns placing a stone of their color onto any empty space. Once placed, the stones are unable to be moved or removed.|1
Auger electron spectroscopy ( AES ; pronounced in French ) is a common analytical technique used specifically in the study of surfaces and films. It is analogous to electron spectroscopy , but instead of detecting photoelectrons by their kinetic energy, electron energies are detected using Auger spectroscopy. The electron energies are measured via Auger electron energy loss spectroscopy (AES) or by measuring the kinetic energy of electrons in their final state, as is the case with x-ray electron spectroscopy. Surfaces and thin films in vacuum are studied using AES because of its high resolution, and its ability to study surfaces and films without contaminating the sample.|0
Crocodiles ( family Crocodylidae ) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa , Asia , the Americas and Australia. Crocodiles grow to around 60 cm (2.00 ft) in length, though the largest recorded specimen was 6.10m (20.0ft) long and weighed over 2000 kg (4,400lb). There are two living species of crocodile: the Indian (Crocodile) , which inhabits the sub-continent , and the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus), which inhabits Southeast Asian and northern Australian waters. The crocodile is, in many respects, an evolutionary anomaly.|0
"Akasha or Akash (Sanskrit  ) means space or sky or æther in traditional Indian cosmology, depending on the religion. The term has also been adopted in Western occultism and spiritualism in the late 19th century. In many modern Indo-Aryan languages and Dravidian languages the corresponding word (often rendered Akash) retains a generic meaning of ""sky"".Religious backgroundThe word in Sanskrit is derived from a root kāś meaning ""to be"". It appears as a masculine noun in Vedic Sanskrit with a generic meaning of ""open space, vacuity""."|1
Giuseppe Saverio Raffaele Mercadante (baptised 17 September 179517 December 1870) was an Italian composer, particularly of operas. While Mercadante may not have retained the international celebrity of Gaetano Donizetti or Gioachino Rossini beyond his own lifetime, he composed as prolific a number of works as either; and his development of operatic structures, melodic styles and orchestration contributed significantly to the foundations upon which Giuseppe Verdi built his dramatic technique.BiographyEarly yearsMercadante was born illegitimate in Altamura, near Bari in Apulia; his precise date of birth has not been recorded, but he was baptised on 17 September 1795.|1

"Bi-curious is a term for a person, usually someone who is a heterosexual, who is curious or open about engaging in sexual activity with a person whose sex differs from that of their usual sexual partners. The term is sometimes used to describe a broad continuum of sexual orientation between heterosexuality and bisexuality. Such continuums include mostly-heterosexual or mostly-homosexual, but these can be self-identified without identifying as bisexual. The terms heteroflexible and homoflexible are mainly applied to bi-curious people, though some authors distinguish heteroflexibility and homoflexibility as lacking the ""wish to experiment with sexuality"" implied by the bi-curious label."|1
Parsifal ( WWV 111 ) is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner with the libretto by the composer, based on Parzival by Wolfram von Eschenbach and Chrétien de Troyes, and on an earlier, incomplete libretto, the second of Wagner’s trilogy of operatic works dealing with the Grail, after The Mastersingers of Nürnberg, and preceding Lohengrin.

A mass driver or electromagnetic catapult is a proposed method of non-rocket spacelaunch which would use a linear motor to accelerate and catapult payloads up to high speeds. Existing and contemplated mass drivers use coils of wire energized by electricity to make electromagnets, though a rotary mass driver has also been proposed. Sequential firing of a row of electromagnets accelerates the payload along a path. After leaving the path, the payload continues to move due to momentum.Although any device used to propel a ballistic payload is technically a mass driver, in this context a mass driver is essentially a coilgun that magnetically accelerates a package consisting of a magnetizable holder containing a payload.|1

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR ) is a method for allocating IP addresses and for IP routing. The Internet Engineering Task Force introduced CIDR in 1993 to replace the previous classful network addressing architecture on the Internet. Its goal was to slow the growth of routing tables on routers across the Internet, and to help slow the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.IP addresses are described as consisting of two groups of bits in the address: the most significant bits are the network prefix, which identifies a whole network or subnet, and the least significant set forms the host identifier, which specifies a particular interface of a host on that network.|1

A gas nuclear reactor (or gas fueled reactor or vapor core reactor) is a proposed kind of nuclear reactor in which the nuclear fuel would be in a gaseous state rather than liquid or solid. In this type of reactor, the only temperature-limiting materials would be the reactor walls. Conventional reactors have stricter limitations because the core would melt if the fuel temperature were to rise too high. It may also be possible to confine gaseous fission fuel magnetically, electrostatically or electrodynamically so that it would not touch (and melt) the reactor walls.|1

In the 1980s , the telecommunications industry expected that digital services would follow much the same pattern as voice services. There would be a gradual rollout of basic digital services that would be followed by more advanced applications. But in reality, this did not quite happen that way. During this time, AT&T developed the Advanced Intelligent Network, which was intended to provide a number of services. By the time that this system was fully implemented, it was clear that the advanced applications could not be implemented. This was mainly due to the fact that the AIN did not provide the necessary level of intelligent services.|0

"The covalent radius , rcov , is a measure of the size of an atom that forms part of one of the following types of bonds:
double bond (C≡C, C≡N, S≡S)
triple bond (O≡O, O≡N)
The bond distance of a double bond in which the two atoms share two electrons, such as the carbon double bond in ethene, is 1.540 Å. The bond distance of a triple bond in which the atoms share three electrons, such as in ethynyl anion, is 1.61 Å. The covalent radius can be determined by either the electronegativity difference or the electron affinity difference."|0

Magma  is the molten or semi-molten natural material from which all igneous rocks are formed. Magma is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and evidence of magmatism has also been discovered on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals and gas bubbles.Magma is produced by melting of the mantle or the crust in various tectonic settings, which on Earth include subduction zones, continental rift zones, mid-ocean ridges and hotspots. Mantle and crustal melts migrate upwards through the crust where they are thought to be stored in magma chambers or trans-crustal crystal-rich mush zones.|1

An ion thruster, ion drive, or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. It creates thrust by accelerating ions using electricity.An ion thruster ionizes a neutral gas by extracting some electrons out of atoms, creating a cloud of positive ions. These ion thrusters rely mainly on electrostatics as ions are accelerated by the Coulomb force along an electric field. Temporarily stored electrons are finally reinjected by a neutralizer in the cloud of ions after it has passed through the electrostatic grid, so the gas becomes neutral again and can freely disperse in space without any further electrical interaction with the thruster.|1

Periods of heat can significantly worsen drought conditions by hastening evaporation of water vapour.Drought is a recurring feature of the climate in most parts of the world.|1
"Parasports are sports played by people with a disability, including physical and intellectual disabilities. Some parasports are forms of adapted physical activities from existing able-bodied sports, while others have been specifically created for persons with a disability and do not have an able-bodied equivalent. Disability exists in four categories: physical, mental, permanent and temporary. At a competitive level, disability sport classifications are applied to allow people of varying abilities to face similar opposition.EtymologyThe term ""parasports"" arose as a portmanteau of the words paraplegic and sports. Though the sport has since included athletes of disabilities other than paraplegia, the term persists as a catch-all."|1

A hybrid-propellant rocket is a rocket with a rocket motor that uses rocket propellants in two different phases: one solid and the other either gas or liquid. The hybrid rocket concept can be traced back to at least the 1930s.Hybrid rockets avoid some of the disadvantages of solid rockets like the dangers of propellant handling, while also avoiding some disadvantages of liquid rockets like their mechanical complexity. Because it is difficult for the fuel and oxidizer to be mixed intimately (being different states of matter), hybrid rockets tend to fail more benignly than liquids or solids.|1

In their most common sense, the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation. Their most paradigmatic forms are judging, reasoning, concept formation, problem solving, and deliberation. But other mental processes, like considering an idea, memory, or imagination, are also often included. These processes can happen internally independent of the sensory organs, unlike perception. But when understood in the widest sense, any mental event may be understood as a form of thinking, including perception and unconscious mental processes.|1

A nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) is a type of thermal rocket where the heat from a nuclear reaction, often nuclear fission, replaces the chemical energy of the propellants in a chemical rocket. In an NTR, a working fluid, usually liquid hydrogen, is heated to a high temperature in a nuclear reactor and then expands through a rocket nozzle to create thrust. The external nuclear heat source theoretically allows a higher effective exhaust velocity and is expected to double or triple payload capacity compared to chemical propellants that store energy internally.NTRs have been proposed as a spacecraft propulsion technology, with the earliest ground tests occurring in 1955.|1
