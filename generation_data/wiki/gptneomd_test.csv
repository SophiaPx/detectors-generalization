Dyson 's eternal intelligence concept ( the Dyson Scenario ) , proposed by Freeman Dyson in 1979 , proposes a universe devoid of any energy or mass. It would consist of infinite, cold, infinite space filled with perfect energy, or a vacuum. All matter would exist as energy particles in the field. The only way to break this vacuum is for particles of any energy to be made out of something else, such as photons of light, black holes, antimatter, or a black hole itself. In other words, Dyson is proposing a universe where no matter exists.|0

A conjugate acid , within the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory , is a chemical compound formed when an acid donates a proton in the form of an ester group to a base. The proton is donated by the base and the resulting acid can be thought of as a salt of the carboxylic acid formed. The name acid–base came from the idea that when the acid was released into the solution, it took up a hydrogen ion to become the base.

In computer programming, a postcondition is a condition or predicate that must always be true just after the execution of some section of code or after an operation in a formal specification. Postconditions are sometimes tested using assertions within the code itself. Often, postconditions are simply included in the documentation of the affected section of code.For example: The result of a factorial is always an integer and greater than or equal to 1. So a program that calculates the factorial of an input number would have postconditions that the result after the calculation be an integer and that it be greater than or equal to 1.|1

In mathematics, two sets are said to be disjoint sets if they have no element in common. Equivalently, two disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is the empty set. For example, {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are disjoint sets, while {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5} are not disjoint. A collection of more than two sets is called disjoint if any two distinct sets of the collection are disjoint.GeneralizationsThis definition of disjoint sets can be extended to a family of sets : the family is pairwise disjoint, or mutually disjoint if  whenever .|1

The 8th century BCE started the first day of 800 BC and ended the last day of 701 BC . This is because there is a discrepancy between the chronology of Ptolemy and the chronology of Josephus in regards to this. According to the first chronology Josephus dates the end of the year to 627 BC , while according to Ptolemy the beginning of the year is around 714 BC . This is because Josephus uses the Babylonian calendar instead of the Gregorian calendar . The reason he used Babylonian calendar is to be able to use all the years of a century without using the leap-years.|0

Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is a neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and related species. It prevents the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from axon endings at the neuromuscular junction, thus causing flaccid paralysis. The toxin causes the disease botulism. The toxin is also used commercially for medical and cosmetic purposes.The seven main types of botulinum toxin are named types A to G (A, B, C1, C2, D, E, F and G). New types are occasionally found. Types A and B are capable of causing disease in humans, and are also used commercially and medically.|1

Observations show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy recedes from the observer is continuously increasing with time.The accelerated expansion was discovered during 1998, by two independent projects, the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-Z Supernova Search Team, which both used distant type Ia supernovae to measure the acceleration. The idea was that as type Ia supernovae have almost the same intrinsic brightness (a standard candle), and since objects that are further away appear dimmer, we can use the observed brightness of these supernovae to measure the distance to them.|1

Observations show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy moves through the universe will increase. The accelerating expansion can be determined from measurements of the growth in the rate of cosmic microwave background temperature fluctuations. These measurements tell us that the universe is expanding faster than previously believed. We also observe that the universe appears to be filled with matter, but that the expansion rate is accelerating. This acceleration can be determined from a measurement of fluctuations in the expansion rate of the universe.|0

Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism, though usually most classify up to homotopy equivalence.Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems, using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible. Algebraic topology, for example, allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a free group is again a free group.Main branches of algebraic topologyBelow are some of the main areas studied in algebraic topology:Homotopy groupsIn mathematics, homotopy groups are used in algebraic topology to classify topological spaces.|1

One of the more notable characteristics of this genus is that members can prey upon other Gram-negative bacteria and feed on the biopolymers, e.g. proteins and nucleic acids, of their hosts. They have two lifestyles: a host-dependent, highly mobile phase, the ""attack phase"", in which they form ""bdelloplasts"" in their host bacteria; and a slow-growing, irregularly shaped, host-independent form.Bdellovibrio bacteriovorusThe most well studied of these is Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, which is found almost exclusively in host dependent growth in nature."|1

"Nature versus nurture is a long-standing debate in biology about the balance between two competing factors which determine fate : ""the ability to reproduce or to pass on your genes to your progeny"" and ""environmental factors"". Environmental factors can cause changes in any of these factors, in which case it is easy to predict that the environment will affect genes. However, we also need to consider other factors, which may in turn influence these factors, as well as other factors that may not be considered here. For instance, in our study, we are not able to include the effects of disease."|0
