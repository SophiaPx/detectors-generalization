"In celestial mechanics, escape velocity or escape speed is the minimum speed needed for a free, non-propelled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a primary body, thus reaching an infinite distance from it. It is typically stated as an ideal speed, ignoring atmospheric friction. Although the term ""escape velocity"" is common, it is more accurately described as a speed than a velocity because it is independent of direction; the escape speed increases with the mass of the primary body and decreases with the distance from the primary body."|1

"The Maunder Minimum, also known as the ""prolonged sunspot minimum"", was a period around 1645 to 1715 during which sunspots became exceedingly rare. During a 28-year period (1672–1699) within the minimum, observations revealed fewer than 50 sunspots. This contrasts with the typical 40,000–50,000 sunspots seen in modern times over a similar timespan.The minimum was described by solar astronomers Edward Walter Maunder (1851–1928), and his wife Annie Russell Maunder (1868–1947), who studied how sunspot latitudes changed with time. Two papers were published in Edward Maunder's name in 1890 and 1894, and he cited earlier papers written by Gustav Spörer."|1

"The Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT, also called block-sorting compression) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters. This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by techniques such as move-to-front transform and run-length encoding. More importantly, the transformation is reversible, without needing to store any additional data except the position of the first original character. The BWT is thus a ""free"" method of improving the efficiency of text compression algorithms, costing only some extra computation."|1
In their most common sense, the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation. Their most paradigmatic forms are judging, reasoning, concept formation, problem solving, and deliberation. But other mental processes, like considering an idea, memory, or imagination, are also often included. These processes can happen internally independent of the sensory organs, unlike perception. But when understood in the widest sense, any mental event may be understood as a form of thinking, including perception and unconscious mental processes.|1

"Cranial nerves are the nerves that emerge directly from the brain ( including the brainstem ) , of which there are 12 major ones. They carry signals to and from the brain . They are also associated with motor functions of the face and with the sense of touch. The cranial nerves are named after their position at or near where they emerge: the olfactory nerves arise from the ethmoid bone and the front of the nasal cavity (hence ""olfactory"" nerve); the trigeminal nerve comes from the temporal bone and the upper jaw (hence ""trigeminal"")."|0

Isotope separation is the process of concentrating specific isotopes of a chemical element by removing other isotopes . The use of isotope separation techniques has been widespread in nuclear power production since the 1950's, but has also been used for industrial applications such as chemical processing, the production of nuclear medical probes, and the production of pure materials. There are two basic types of isotope separation methods. The first method uses nuclear separation techniques, in which the lighter isotopes are separated due to the energy differences between them. This is commonly achieved using the difference in mass of a nucleus, but other methods are also used.|0

A mass driver or electromagnetic catapult is a proposed method of non-rocket spacelaunch which would use a linear motor to accelerate and catapult payloads up to high speeds. Existing and contemplated mass drivers use coils of wire energized by electricity to make electromagnets, though a rotary mass driver has also been proposed. Sequential firing of a row of electromagnets accelerates the payload along a path. After leaving the path, the payload continues to move due to momentum.Although any device used to propel a ballistic payload is technically a mass driver, in this context a mass driver is essentially a coilgun that magnetically accelerates a package consisting of a magnetizable holder containing a payload.|1

Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents. Legal adoptions permanently transfer all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parents to the adoptive parents.Unlike guardianship or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption, while others used less formal means (notably contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of filiation).|1

"Bi-curious is a term for a person, usually someone who is a heterosexual, who is curious or open about engaging in sexual activity with a person whose sex differs from that of their usual sexual partners. The term is sometimes used to describe a broad continuum of sexual orientation between heterosexuality and bisexuality. Such continuums include mostly-heterosexual or mostly-homosexual, but these can be self-identified without identifying as bisexual. The terms heteroflexible and homoflexible are mainly applied to bi-curious people, though some authors distinguish heteroflexibility and homoflexibility as lacking the ""wish to experiment with sexuality"" implied by the bi-curious label."|1
"Fermat's principle, also known as the principle of least time, is the link between ray optics and wave optics. In its original ""strong"" form, Fermat's principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time. In order to be true in all cases, this statement must be weakened by replacing the ""least"" time with a time that is ""stationary"" with respect to variations of the path — so that a deviation in the path causes, at most, a second-order change in the traversal time."|1
Frame Relay is a standardized wide area network (WAN) technology that specifies the physical and data link layers of digital telecommunications channels using a packet switching methodology.

"Isotope separation is the process of concentrating specific isotopes of a chemical element by removing other isotopes. The use of the nuclides produced is varied. The largest variety is used in research (e.g. in chemistry where atoms of ""marker"" nuclide are used to figure out reaction mechanisms). By tonnage, separating natural uranium into enriched uranium and depleted uranium is the largest application. In the following text, mainly the uranium enrichment is considered. This process is crucial in the manufacture of uranium fuel for nuclear power plants, and is also required for the creation of uranium-based nuclear weapons."|1
"Medina , officially Al Madinah Al Munawwarah and also commonly simplified as Madīnah or Madinah , is the second-holiest city in Islam. It is located in the southern part of Saudi Arabia.

In 711, during the caliphate of Umar II [717–743], Umayyad forces destroyed the city of Medina, along with a significant portion of the Muslim population, in a campaign of annihilation and plunder. It was rebuilt by Yazid I [714–715], Umayyad Caliph and the son of Mu'awiya I [661–680]."|0
Auger electron spectroscopy (AES; pronounced  in French) is a common analytical technique used specifically in the study of surfaces and, more generally, in the area of materials science. It is a form of electron spectroscopy that relies on the Auger effect, based on the analysis of energetic electrons emitted from an excited atom after a series of internal relaxation events. The Auger effect was discovered independently by both Lise Meitner and Pierre Auger in the 1920s. Though the discovery was made by Meitner and initially reported in the journal Zeitschrift für Physik in 1922, Auger is credited with the discovery in most of the scientific community.|1

An ion thruster, ion drive, or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. It creates thrust by accelerating ions using electricity.An ion thruster ionizes a neutral gas by extracting some electrons out of atoms, creating a cloud of positive ions. These ion thrusters rely mainly on electrostatics as ions are accelerated by the Coulomb force along an electric field. Temporarily stored electrons are finally reinjected by a neutralizer in the cloud of ions after it has passed through the electrostatic grid, so the gas becomes neutral again and can freely disperse in space without any further electrical interaction with the thruster.|1

In Euclidean geometry , an affine transformation , or an affinity ( from the Latin , affinis , `` connected with''), is a transformation of plane or space that preserves both the magnitude and relative position of points while allowing a parallel displacement of points and lines. Affine transformations are also known as projective transformations , because points on the plane and lines on the plane project to a point and a line on a plane that is parallel to the original plane , as shown in figure 4.1. An affine transformations are inverses of one another, since they preserve parallelism between the two planes (figure 4.1).|0

The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one that is divisible by 2, or by any other natural number. It has now been proved for every number greater than five. The problem has an interesting history and there are many variants. For example, instead of asking whether the number will eventually reach one, you can ask what it does when it reaches two. If your number is divisible by three when you reach two, what will it be divisible by when it reaches three?|0

Wind tunnels are large tubes with air blowing through them which are used to replicate the interaction between air and a vehicle passing through the tube. To do this they must be very long so they can replicate a distance and have an air speed which is high enough to create the desired force on a vehicle. This high speed air can be created by blowing air in the direction of the vehicle, but to get the same air speed you need to have a large cross section which increases the air friction on the vehicle which causes drag and a decrease in vehicle performance.|0

The different species are pyrope, almandine, spessartine, grossular (varieties of which are hessonite or cinnamon-stone and tsavorite), uvarovite and andradite. The garnets make up two solid solution series: pyrope-almandine-spessartine (pyralspite) and uvarovite-grossular-andradite (ugrandite).EtymologyThe word garnet comes from the 14th-century Middle English word gernet, meaning 'dark red'. It is borrowed from Old French grenate from Latin granatus, from granum ('grain, seed').|1

Dekker 's algorithm is the first known correct solution to the mutual exclusion problem in concurrent programming . The solution is based on two properties of a single shared memory: First, two concurrent threads, one reading and one writing to the memory, cannot access the same memory location in the same time period. The other property is that each thread must read at least one memory location while writing to at least another memory location. Mutual exclusion algorithms in concurrent programming usually have two phases: The first phase consists of acquiring a mutual exclusion lock at a single location or at a small number of locations .|0

The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. It  concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.The conjecture is named after mathematician Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate.|1

The raven paradox, also known as Hempel's paradox, Hempel's ravens, or rarely the paradox of indoor ornithology, is a paradox arising from the question of what constitutes evidence for a statement. Observing objects that are neither black nor ravens may formally increase the likelihood that all ravens are black even though, intuitively, these observations are unrelated.This problem was proposed by the logician Carl Gustav Hempel in the 1940s to illustrate a contradiction between inductive logic and intuition.Paradox Hempel describes the paradox in terms of the hypothesis: (1) All ravens are black.|1
A resistojet is a method of spacecraft propulsion ( electric propulsion ) that provides thrust by heating a , typically an electrically conductive fluid such as ionized xenon gas, to produce ionized fluid particles that are accelerated by an electrostatic field to produce thrust . As with other forms of spacecraft propulsion, a resistojet provides no specific thrust, and the acceleration is a result of momentum transfer, rather than any specific interaction with the spacecraft. In other words, it depends on the electrostatic field, which is usually a function of the current that flows through the spacecraft's hull, and the distance from the hull.|0

"The unexpected hanging paradox or surprise test paradox is a paradox about a person's expectations about the timing of a future event which they are told will occur at an unexpected time. The paradox is variously applied to a prisoner's hanging, or a surprise school test. It was first introduced to the public in Martin Gardner's March 1963 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American magazine.There is no consensus on its precise nature and consequently a canonical resolution has not been agreed on. Logical analyses focus on ""truth values"", for example by identifying it as paradox of self-reference."|1

"A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura (literally without tail in Ancient Greek). The oldest fossil ""proto-frog"" Triadobatrachus is known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their split from other amphibians may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforest. Frogs account for around 88% of extant amphibian species."|1

"A software bug is an error, flaw or fault in computer software that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The process of finding and correcting bugs is termed ""debugging"" and often uses formal techniques or tools to pinpoint bugs. Since the 1950s some computer systems have been designed to deter, detect or auto-correct various computer bugs during operations.Most bugs arise from mistakes and errors made in either a program's design or its source code, or in components and operating systems used by such programs."|1
Glam rock is a style of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s and was pioneered by artists such as Marc Bolan, T.Rex, David Bowie, David Coverdale and Queen.

"Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to femininity and masculinity and differentiating between them. Depending on the context, this may include sex-based social structures (i.e. gender roles) and gender identity. Most cultures use a gender binary, having two genders (boys/men and girls/women); those who exist outside these groups may fall under the umbrella term non-binary. Some societies have specific genders besides ""man"" and ""woman"", such as the hijras of South Asia; these are often referred to as third genders (and fourth genders, etc.)."|1

A pegmatite is an igneous rock showing a very coarse texture , with large interlocking crystals usually greater in size than the rock itself. Common minerals associated with pegmatite include quartz, fluorite, biotite and spodumene. Pegmatite deposits are most commonly formed from volcanic magma, or lava from magma chamber eruption. The resulting rocks are very fine grained, and have high concentrations of silica and alumina. These minerals crystallized during cooling of the lava from a high temperature to a lower temperature, but are then re-melted during later eruptions. As a result of the melting, they tend to be small and angular in shape.|0

A seed is an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering. The formation of the seed is part of the process of reproduction in seed plants, the spermatophytes, including the gymnosperm and angiosperm plants.Seeds are the product of the ripened ovule, after fertilization by pollen and some growth within the mother plant. The embryo develops from the zygote, and the seed coat from the integuments of the ovule. Seeds have been an important development in the reproduction and success of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants, relative to more primitive plants such as ferns, mosses and liverworts, which do not have seeds and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves.|1

"Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare. Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the history of England, they were classified as ""histories"" in the First Folio. The Roman tragedies—Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus—are also based on historical figures, but because their sources were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories. Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy."|1
A shaped charge is an explosive charge shaped to focus the effect of the explosive 's energy . Different types of shaped charges are designed for various applications such as breaching or making holes in hard targets. For example, a simple conical shaped charge is designed to create a very high-velocity jet of molten metal, which is highly effective for breaching hardened armour (or other hard targets). The jet is also capable of penetrating great distances with relatively little residual damage. To improve penetration a number of additional shapes can be applied to this basic design[1].|0

A hybrid-propellant rocket is a rocket with a rocket motor that uses rocket propellants in two different phases : one that ignites, and one that produces thrust. The first-stage and second-stage propulsion system is usually the same as that used in a conventional chemical-propellant rocket, with the propellants being stored in the first stage and ignited by a chemical reaction to produce thrust, and the first and second stages being separated at an altitude where the first stage is decelerated before the second stage continues its ascent. Most commonly, the first-stage propellants are gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, but other fuels may be used.|0

Nuclear engineering is the branch of engineering concerned with the application of breaking down  atomic nuclei (fission) or of combining atomic nuclei (fusion),  or with the application of other sub-atomic processes based on the principles of nuclear physics. In the sub-field of nuclear fission, it particularly includes the design, interaction, and maintenance of systems and components like reactors, power plants, or weaponry. The field also includes the study of medical and other applications of radiation, particularly Ionizing radiation, nuclear safety, heat/thermodynamics transport, nuclear fuel, or other related technology (e.g., radioactive waste disposal) and the problems of nuclear proliferation.|1
Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton's third law. When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction, the accelerated mass will cause a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction to be applied to that system.The force applied on a surface in a direction perpendicular or normal to the surface is also called thrust. Force, and thus thrust, is measured using the International System of Units (SI) in newtons (symbol: N), and represents the amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 meter per second per second.|1
A gas nuclear reactor (or gas fueled reactor or vapor core reactor) is a proposed kind of nuclear reactor in which the nuclear fuel would be in a gaseous state rather than liquid or solid. In this type of reactor, the only temperature-limiting materials would be the reactor walls. Conventional reactors have stricter limitations because the core would melt if the fuel temperature were to rise too high. It may also be possible to confine gaseous fission fuel magnetically, electrostatically or electrodynamically so that it would not touch (and melt) the reactor walls.|1

Hilbert 's paradox of the Grand Hotel ( colloquial : Infinite Hotel Paradox or Hilbert 's Hotel ) is a paradox of mathematical logic or informal logic, due to the German mathematician David Hilbert. The paradox arose from the discussion in the second half of his famous list of 23 problems for the third mathematical congress , held in Vienna in August 1900, at which he argued that no formal logical system could be complete, even though this should have been a basic assumption from the start of logical investigations. The paradox has inspired a great deal of controversy in mathematics and informal logic, and many solutions have been proposed.|0
Catalase is a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen ( such as bacteria , plants and animals ). Catalase is used to protect organisms from harmful superoxide radicals, which cause DNA damage and can result in cancer[1][2] . Catalase activity is usually measured spectrophotometrically, by measuring the decomposition of its substrate, H2O2. [3] Catalase and other peroxidases require hydrogen donors and/or hydrogen peroxide to accomplish their oxidation-reduction functions. The hydrogen donor is often reduced to water or hydroxyl ion, and the resulting free electron pair is then used for reduction of the peroxidase substrate or the hydrogen donor.|0

"The oxidation state, or oxidation number, is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to different atoms were fully ionic. It describes the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state may be positive, negative or zero. While fully ionic bonds are not found in nature, many bonds exhibit strong ionicity, making oxidation state a useful predictor of charge.The oxidation state of an atom does not represent the ""real"" formal charge on that atom, or any other actual atomic property."|1

In quantum mechanics , counterfactual definiteness ( CFD ) is the ability to speak `` meaningfully '' of the definiteness or lack thereof of a physical observable. For example, when we measure the position of an electron, it is the position itself which is measured, not something else. Thus, a measurement on an electron gives the location of the electron as a point, but does not specify its position at the location of measurement. For the electron, its position does not exist at the location of the measurement. However, we can speak meaningfully of an electron not existing at the location of measurement.|0
An inverse multiplexer (often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX) allows a data stream to be broken into multiple lower data rate communication links. An inverse multiplexer differs from a demultiplexer because the multiple output streams from the former stay inter-related, whereas those from the latter are unrelated. An inverse multiplexer is the opposite of a multiplexer  in that it divides one high-speed link into multiple low-speed links, whereas a multiplexer combines multiple low-speed links into one high-speed link.This provides an end to end connection of several times the data rate available on each of the low rate data links.|1

"Plotinus (; , Plōtînos;  – 270 CE) was a philosopher in the Hellenistic tradition, born and raised in Roman Egypt. Plotinus is regarded by modern scholarship as the founder of Neoplatonism. His teacher was the self-taught philosopher Ammonius Saccas, who belonged to the Platonic tradition. Historians of the 19th century invented the term ""Neoplatonism"" and applied it to refer to Plotinus and his philosophy, which was vastly influential during Late Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance. Much of the biographical information about Plotinus comes from Porphyry's preface to his edition of Plotinus' most notable literary work, The Enneads."|1

Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton 's third law . When a system expels or accelerates mass, its momentum is transferred to all other particles in the universe in the direction of the applied force. In this experiment, we study the forces involved in the motion of a system of masses as a result of their gravitational interaction with the earth, and we observe the effect of this interaction by applying a torque to the center of mass. The experiment is repeated in various conditions, in order to investigate the nature of the forces that cause the change in momentum.|0

A nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) is a type of thermal rocket where the heat from a nuclear reaction, often nuclear fission, replaces the chemical energy of the propellants in a chemical rocket. In an NTR, a working fluid, usually liquid hydrogen, is heated to a high temperature in a nuclear reactor and then expands through a rocket nozzle to create thrust. The external nuclear heat source theoretically allows a higher effective exhaust velocity and is expected to double or triple payload capacity compared to chemical propellants that store energy internally.NTRs have been proposed as a spacecraft propulsion technology, with the earliest ground tests occurring in 1955.|1
