An inverse multiplexer ( often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX ) allows a data stream to be broken into individual data streams (often referred to as “bitstreams”) and the data is then combined with another data stream if the data is processed to produce a single-data stream. The data is then fed through an inverse-multiply/add-multiplier system, and then further processed by a next-data feed system (often referred to as a “blended” or “multiply” system). A first bitstream of data may contain a plurality of symbols and one or more numbers.|0

In chemistry, a nucleophile is a chemical species that forms bonds with electrophiles by donating an electron pair. All molecules and ions with a free pair of electrons or at least one pi bond can act as nucleophiles. Because nucleophiles donate electrons, they are Lewis bases. Nucleophilic describes the affinity of a nucleophile to bond with positively charged atomic nuclei. Nucleophilicity, sometimes referred to as nucleophile strength, refers to a substance's nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the affinity of atoms. Neutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohols and water are named solvolysis.|1
The pancreas is an organ of the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and functions as a gland.

Mystery religions, mystery cults, sacred mysteries or simply mysteries, were religious schools of the Greco-Roman world for which participation was reserved to initiates (mystai). The main characterization of this religion is the secrecy associated with the particulars of the initiation and the ritual practice, which may not be revealed to outsiders. The most famous mysteries of Greco-Roman antiquity were the Eleusinian Mysteries, which were of considerable antiquity and predated the Greek Dark Ages. The mystery schools flourished in Late Antiquity; Julian the Apostate in the mid 4th century is known to have been initiated into three distinct mystery schools—most notably the mithraists.|1
"Isotope separation is the process of concentrating specific isotopes of a chemical element by removing other isotopes. The use of the nuclides produced is varied. The largest variety is used in research (e.g. in chemistry where atoms of ""marker"" nuclide are used to figure out reaction mechanisms). By tonnage, separating natural uranium into enriched uranium and depleted uranium is the largest application. In the following text, mainly the uranium enrichment is considered. This process is crucial in the manufacture of uranium fuel for nuclear power plants, and is also required for the creation of uranium-based nuclear weapons."|1

In their most common sense , the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently in different contexts, and they are often used together. They may be used more loosely, but they are sometimes used interchangeably – meaning that thinking is conscious, and thinking is the act of doing. As I have explained in the previous chapter, this is how I see the term thinking. Thinking is at the heart of much of what our brains do (which means that thinking is at work as well in our everyday life as it does in our social world).|0

In economics, inflation refers to a general progressive increase in prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. The opposite of inflation is deflation, a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualised percentage change in a general price index.Prices will not all increase at the same rates. Attaching a representative value to a set of prices is an instance of the index number problem.|1

Dekker 's algorithm is the first known correct solution to the mutual exclusion problem in concurrent programming . The solution to the mutual exclusion problem is a non-convergence result, which can be found using an algorithm in a parallel form . However, a problem arises where the algorithm will be able to solve the problem without using parallel computing devices, even if the algorithm can be done without parallel computing devices (which is not the case in our example). In such a case the algorithm needs to be initialized in a sequential manner . This algorithm is called a “step function”.|0

"Plotinus (; , Plōtînos;  – 270 CE) was a philosopher in the Hellenistic tradition, born and raised in Roman Egypt. Plotinus is regarded by modern scholarship as the founder of Neoplatonism. His teacher was the self-taught philosopher Ammonius Saccas, who belonged to the Platonic tradition. Historians of the 19th century invented the term ""Neoplatonism"" and applied it to refer to Plotinus and his philosophy, which was vastly influential during Late Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance. Much of the biographical information about Plotinus comes from Porphyry's preface to his edition of Plotinus' most notable literary work, The Enneads."|1
"Fermat's principle, also known as the principle of least time, is the link between ray optics and wave optics. In its original ""strong"" form, Fermat's principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time. In order to be true in all cases, this statement must be weakened by replacing the ""least"" time with a time that is ""stationary"" with respect to variations of the path — so that a deviation in the path causes, at most, a second-order change in the traversal time."|1

A seed is an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering. The formation of the seed is part of the process of reproduction in seed plants, the spermatophytes, including the gymnosperm and angiosperm plants.Seeds are the product of the ripened ovule, after fertilization by pollen and some growth within the mother plant. The embryo develops from the zygote, and the seed coat from the integuments of the ovule. Seeds have been an important development in the reproduction and success of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants, relative to more primitive plants such as ferns, mosses and liverworts, which do not have seeds and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves.|1

"The oxidation state, or oxidation number, is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to different atoms were fully ionic. It describes the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state may be positive, negative or zero. While fully ionic bonds are not found in nature, many bonds exhibit strong ionicity, making oxidation state a useful predictor of charge.The oxidation state of an atom does not represent the ""real"" formal charge on that atom, or any other actual atomic property."|1

"In the philosophy of mathematics, the abstraction of actual infinity involves the acceptance (if the axiom of infinity is included) of infinite entities as given, actual and completed objects. These might include the set of natural numbers, extended real numbers, transfinite numbers, or even an infinite sequence of rational numbers. Actual infinity is to be contrasted with potential infinity, in which a non-terminating process (such as ""add 1 to the previous number"") produces a sequence with no last element, and where each individual result is finite and is achieved in a finite number of steps."|1
"A nuclear thermal rocket ( NTR ) is a type of thermal rocket where the heat from a nuclear reaction is transferred to a hot object ( called a ""hot object"" ) by a heat conduction mechanism.

Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents. Legal adoptions permanently transfer all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parents to the adoptive parents.Unlike guardianship or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption, while others used less formal means (notably contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of filiation).|1

Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton's third law. When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction, the accelerated mass will cause a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction to be applied to that system.The force applied on a surface in a direction perpendicular or normal to the surface is also called thrust. Force, and thus thrust, is measured using the International System of Units (SI) in newtons (symbol: N), and represents the amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 meter per second per second.|1

The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. It  concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.The conjecture is named after mathematician Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate.|1

"A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura (literally without tail in Ancient Greek). The oldest fossil ""proto-frog"" Triadobatrachus is known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their split from other amphibians may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforest. Frogs account for around 88% of extant amphibian species."|1

In commutative algebra , the prime spectrum ( or simply the spectrum ) of a ring R is the set of all finite words in , where the first element is the identity element in R. The set of all words in R is called the commutator of the set of all its elements. The congruence group X(R) consists of elements of order , which are the elements of the commutative ring R that are not of order , so that X(R)=R if and only if they commute with each other for any pair of generators.|0
The Avignon Papacy was the period from 1309 to 1376 during which seven successive popes resided in Avignon (then in the Kingdom of Arles, part of the Holy Roman Empire, now in France) rather than in Rome. The situation arose from the conflict between the papacy and the French crown, culminating in the death of Pope Boniface VIII after his arrest and maltreatment by Philip IV of France. Following the further death of Pope Benedict XI, Philip forced a deadlocked conclave to elect the French Clement V as pope in 1305.|1

"A seal is a device for making an impression in wax, clay, paper, or some other medium, including an embossment on paper, and is also the impression thus made. The original purpose was to authenticate a document, or to prevent interference with a package or envelope by applying a seal which had to be broken to open the container (hence the modern English verb ""to seal"", which implies secure closing without an actual wax seal).The seal-making device is also referred to as the seal matrix or die; the imprint it creates as the seal impression (or, more rarely, the sealing)."|1
A finger is a limb of the body and a type of digit, an organ of manipulation and sensation found in the hands of most of the Tetrapods, so also with humans and other primates. Most land vertebrates have five fingers (Pentadactyly).Land vertebrate fingers The five-rayed anterior limbs of terrestrial vertebrates can be derived phylogenetically from the pectoral fins of fish. Within the taxa of the terrestrial vertebrates, the basic pentadactyl plan, and thus also the fingers and phalanges, undergoe many variations.Morphologically the different fingers of terrestrial vertebrates are homolog. The wings of birds and those of bats are not homologous, they are analogue flight organs.|1
SPARC (Scalable Processor Architecture) is a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) instruction set architecture originally developed by Sun Microsystems. Its design was strongly influenced by the experimental Berkeley RISC system developed in the early 1980s. First developed in 1986 and released in 1987, SPARC was one of the most successful early commercial RISC systems, and its success led to the introduction of similar RISC designs from a number of vendors through the 1980s and 90s.The first implementation of the original 32-bit architecture (SPARC V7) was used in Sun's Sun-4 workstation and server systems, replacing their earlier Sun-3 systems based on the Motorola 68000 series of processors.|1

In chemistry , a nucleophile is a chemical species that forms bonds with electrophiles by donating an electron pair . In the case of DNA nucleosides and peptides, the hydrogen-bonding between the nucleotide and the electrophile may be broken in a stepwise fashion, such as by removing the nucleophile . It is also believed that this is a necessary property of nucleophiles, which in nature form a sequence with a low degree of homology and are formed only by nucleophiles. To be more specific, the hydrogen-bonding between the nucleotide or the electrophile (and the hydrogen) is a stepwise process.|0

Dementia manifests as a set of related symptoms , which usually surface when the brain is damaged by injury or disease. It is the most significant symptom of dementia and has an impact on the everyday life of individuals who have the disease. The main characteristic that dementia causes is the increase of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB functions as a barrier to the brain, but it does not function to protect the brain from the damage caused by any of its functions. It helps in the removal of brain cells that have been damaged or diseased.|0
"In quantum mechanics, counterfactual definiteness (CFD) is the ability to speak ""meaningfully"" of the definiteness of the results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e., the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured). The term ""counterfactual definiteness"" is used in discussions of physics calculations, especially those related to the phenomenon called quantum entanglement and those related to the Bell inequalities. In such discussions ""meaningfully"" means the ability to treat these unmeasured results on an equal footing with measured results in statistical calculations."|1

"Humour (Commonwealth English) or humor (American English) is the tendency of experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement. The term derives from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks, which taught that the balance of fluids in the human body, known as humours (Latin: humor, ""body fluid""), controlled human health and emotion.People of all ages and cultures respond to humour. Most people are able to experience humour—be amused, smile or laugh at something funny (such as a pun or joke)—and thus are considered to have a sense of humour."|1

A seed is an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering . The formation of the seed is part of a biological process known as the seed germination pathway. This pathway plays an important role in maintaining plant development. Plants have multiple functions that involve multiple stages of seed development. Plants have specialized processes to produce and secrete seeds, which includes germination, embryo development and seed transport. In addition, each stage of seed development is also dependent on the stage of the embryo development (i.e., embryo stage). Thus, the stages of seed development play important roles in maintaining plant growth and development.|0

"The unexpected hanging paradox or surprise test paradox is a paradox about a person's expectations about the timing of a future event which they are told will occur at an unexpected time. The paradox is variously applied to a prisoner's hanging, or a surprise school test. It was first introduced to the public in Martin Gardner's March 1963 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American magazine.There is no consensus on its precise nature and consequently a canonical resolution has not been agreed on. Logical analyses focus on ""truth values"", for example by identifying it as paradox of self-reference."|1
A resistojet is a method of spacecraft propulsion ( electric propulsion ) that provides thrust by heating a , typically aluminum , propellant in order to provide propulsion of a spacecraft or spacecraft on the surface or in its path. Saving the energy required to create thrust on a spacecraft and its path is an integral part of the propulsion of a spacecraft. The thrust is achieved by moving the spacecraft in an electric or magnetic path. This type of propulsion could be accomplished as a means to lower the payload to below , thereby decreasing the weight of spacecraft.|0

"The Maunder Minimum, also known as the ""prolonged sunspot minimum"", was a period around 1645 to 1715 during which sunspots became exceedingly rare. During a 28-year period (1672–1699) within the minimum, observations revealed fewer than 50 sunspots. This contrasts with the typical 40,000–50,000 sunspots seen in modern times over a similar timespan.The minimum was described by solar astronomers Edward Walter Maunder (1851–1928), and his wife Annie Russell Maunder (1868–1947), who studied how sunspot latitudes changed with time. Two papers were published in Edward Maunder's name in 1890 and 1894, and he cited earlier papers written by Gustav Spörer."|1

While a significant majority of water vessels are powered by diesel engines, with sail power and gasoline engines also popular, boats powered by electricity have been used for over 120 years. Electric boats were very popular from the 1880s until the 1920s, when the internal combustion engine became dominant. Since the energy crises of the 1970s, interest in this quiet and potentially renewable marine energy source has been increasing steadily, especially as more efficient solar cells have become available, for the first time making possible motorboats with an infinite range like sailboats. The first practical solar boat was probably constructed in 1975 in England.|1
A hybrid-propellant rocket is a rocket with a rocket motor that uses rocket propellants in two different phases: one solid and the other either gas or liquid. The hybrid rocket concept can be traced back to at least the 1930s.Hybrid rockets avoid some of the disadvantages of solid rockets like the dangers of propellant handling, while also avoiding some disadvantages of liquid rockets like their mechanical complexity. Because it is difficult for the fuel and oxidizer to be mixed intimately (being different states of matter), hybrid rockets tend to fail more benignly than liquids or solids.|1

"The Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT, also called block-sorting compression) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters. This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by techniques such as move-to-front transform and run-length encoding. More importantly, the transformation is reversible, without needing to store any additional data except the position of the first original character. The BWT is thus a ""free"" method of improving the efficiency of text compression algorithms, costing only some extra computation."|1
An ion thruster, ion drive, or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. It creates thrust by accelerating ions using electricity.An ion thruster ionizes a neutral gas by extracting some electrons out of atoms, creating a cloud of positive ions. These ion thrusters rely mainly on electrostatics as ions are accelerated by the Coulomb force along an electric field. Temporarily stored electrons are finally reinjected by a neutralizer in the cloud of ions after it has passed through the electrostatic grid, so the gas becomes neutral again and can freely disperse in space without any further electrical interaction with the thruster.|1

A mass driver or electromagnetic catapult is a proposed method of non-rocket spacelaunch which would use a linear motor to accelerate and catapult payloads up to high speeds. Existing and contemplated mass drivers use coils of wire energized by electricity to make electromagnets, though a rotary mass driver has also been proposed. Sequential firing of a row of electromagnets accelerates the payload along a path. After leaving the path, the payload continues to move due to momentum.Although any device used to propel a ballistic payload is technically a mass driver, in this context a mass driver is essentially a coilgun that magnetically accelerates a package consisting of a magnetizable holder containing a payload.|1

"Liberation theology is a Christian theological approach emphasizing the liberation of the oppressed. In certain contexts, it engages socio-economic analyses, with ""social concern for the poor and political liberation for oppressed peoples."" In other contexts, it addresses other forms of inequality, such as race or caste.Liberation theology is best known in the Latin American context, especially within Catholicism in the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council, where it became the political praxis of theologians such as Gustavo Gutiérrez, Leonardo Boff, and Jesuits Juan Luis Segundo and Jon Sobrino, who popularized the phrase ""preferential option for the poor""."|1
"Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton 's third law . When a system expels or accelerates mass, it changes the force on a given system . It is well known that a system's force on one system is equal to the force applied on that system . For example, the second law of thermodynamics states that:
The gravitational forces between two bodies are balanced if their momenta are aligned along a straight line passing through the body's central axis . Thus the momentum of one body and its rest mass are balanced ."|0

"Bi-curious is a term for a person, usually someone who is a heterosexual, who is curious or open about engaging in sexual activity with a person whose sex differs from that of their usual sexual partners. The term is sometimes used to describe a broad continuum of sexual orientation between heterosexuality and bisexuality. Such continuums include mostly-heterosexual or mostly-homosexual, but these can be self-identified without identifying as bisexual. The terms heteroflexible and homoflexible are mainly applied to bi-curious people, though some authors distinguish heteroflexibility and homoflexibility as lacking the ""wish to experiment with sexuality"" implied by the bi-curious label."|1
The raven paradox, also known as Hempel's paradox, Hempel's ravens, or rarely the paradox of indoor ornithology, is a paradox arising from the question of what constitutes evidence for a statement. Observing objects that are neither black nor ravens may formally increase the likelihood that all ravens are black even though, intuitively, these observations are unrelated.This problem was proposed by the logician Carl Gustav Hempel in the 1940s to illustrate a contradiction between inductive logic and intuition.Paradox Hempel describes the paradox in terms of the hypothesis: (1) All ravens are black.|1

"Nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, nitrous, or nos, is a chemical compound, an oxide of nitrogen with the formula . At room temperature, it is a colourless non-flammable gas, with a slight metallic scent and taste. At elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidiser similar to molecular oxygen.Nitrous oxide has significant medical uses, especially in surgery and dentistry, for its anaesthetic and pain reducing effects. Its colloquial name, ""laughing gas"", coined by Humphry Davy, is due to the euphoric effects upon inhaling it, a property that has led to its recreational use as a dissociative anaesthetic."|1
A gas nuclear reactor (or gas fueled reactor or vapor core reactor) is a proposed kind of nuclear reactor in which the nuclear fuel would be in a gaseous state rather than liquid or solid. In this type of reactor, the only temperature-limiting materials would be the reactor walls. Conventional reactors have stricter limitations because the core would melt if the fuel temperature were to rise too high. It may also be possible to confine gaseous fission fuel magnetically, electrostatically or electrodynamically so that it would not touch (and melt) the reactor walls.|1

A radionuclide (radioactive nuclide, radioisotope or radioactive isotope) is a nuclide that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. This excess energy can be used in one of three ways: emitted from the nucleus as gamma radiation; transferred to one of its electrons to release it as a conversion electron; or used to create and emit a new particle (alpha particle or beta particle) from the nucleus. During those processes, the radionuclide is said to undergo radioactive decay. These emissions are considered ionizing radiation because they are powerful enough to liberate an electron from another atom.|1
A Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, usually known as the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers (NPNF), is a set of books containing translations of early Christian writings into English.

A nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) is a type of thermal rocket where the heat from a nuclear reaction, often nuclear fission, replaces the chemical energy of the propellants in a chemical rocket. In an NTR, a working fluid, usually liquid hydrogen, is heated to a high temperature in a nuclear reactor and then expands through a rocket nozzle to create thrust. The external nuclear heat source theoretically allows a higher effective exhaust velocity and is expected to double or triple payload capacity compared to chemical propellants that store energy internally.NTRs have been proposed as a spacecraft propulsion technology, with the earliest ground tests occurring in 1955.|1

Nuclear engineering is the branch of engineering concerned with the application of breaking down atomic nuclei ( fission ) or atom-bonding molecules ( biding ) in a sample, such as a cell. In the past, atomic biding molecules were used, for example, as ligands for biocatalysis. In recent years, the technology for the production of nuclei has been promoted, as it is in the process of making atoms or molecules. For example, in the production of a biological molecule, a nucleon is produced via chemical reaction, such as the dissociation of a base or the nucleophilic nucleophile.|0
The Burrows–Wheeler transform ( BWT , also called block-sorting compression ) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters, and returns the original string as an array of bytes. In order to allow the transform to take more characters when processing a single character out of a string, the function rewrites all characters from the array into a string. This method has two different effects. With rewrites as an input, the characters from the array can be read and the string returned as an object, or as bytes from a file. This method returns a byte array of the string and an object array of the string returned.|0

An inverse multiplexer (often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX) allows a data stream to be broken into multiple lower data rate communication links. An inverse multiplexer differs from a demultiplexer because the multiple output streams from the former stay inter-related, whereas those from the latter are unrelated. An inverse multiplexer is the opposite of a multiplexer  in that it divides one high-speed link into multiple low-speed links, whereas a multiplexer combines multiple low-speed links into one high-speed link.This provides an end to end connection of several times the data rate available on each of the low rate data links.|1

In AES, ions of various compositions are produced through the electrostatic interactions of an electron donor to an electron acceptor. This type of method provides a high resolution of the absorption spectrum. In AES, it is commonly performed to examine the absorption spectrum after the electrostatic interaction between an electron donor/acceptor and an electron acceptor, and to measure the position of the absorption edges in the spectra after an electron is excited.|0
The Magic Flute (German: , ), K. 620, is an opera in two acts by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to a German libretto by Emanuel Schikaneder. The work is in the form of a Singspiel, a popular form during the time it was written that included both singing and spoken dialogue. The work premiered on 30 September 1791 at Schikaneder's theatre, the Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna, just two months before the composer's premature death. Still a staple of the opera repertory, its popularity was reflected by two immediate sequels, Peter Winter's Das Labyrinth oder Der Kampf mit den Elementen.|1
The oxidation state , or oxidation number , is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds have the same electron charge. This can easily be seen by looking at Figure 1.2 in the paper from which it is derived. This shows that in a few atoms the number of electrons is proportional to the number of bonding bonds. In the case of a single oxygen atom it is always proportional to the number of bonds. In addition to that the number of bond molecules is proportional to their atomic mass. Therefore the number of electrons in each atom is proportional to the number of atoms.|0
Numismatics is the study or collection of currency , including coins , tokens , paper money , medals and related items , among others , in which each coin is valued with a monetary value called the value of the dollar or euro , or the number of cents. There are coins, tokens and commodities, which have been extensively studied, in which they are represented as a single symbol or character, in the form of a black circle or circle-like object. The coin which is most commonly used in commerce and art is the standard currency of a country.|0
"The Hippocratic Oath is an oath of ethics historically taken by physicians . It is one of the most widely accepted and well known forms of medicine and is an integral part of many health care systems around the world and is the basis for many pharmaceuticals and medicine products . It provides for the management of symptoms of medical conditions and for the care of patients during a medical emergency. Hippocrates – a Greek doctor, a follower of Hippocrates who lived and died in what is today the Roman Empire, the Greek word for ""pharmacologically"" is Phaeogeos."|0
Aden ( ,  ;   Yemeni: ) is a city, and since 2015, the temporary capital of Yemen, near the eastern approach to the Red Sea (the Gulf of Aden), some  east of the strait Bab-el-Mandeb. Its population is approximately 800,000 people. Aden's natural harbour lies in the crater of a dormant volcano, which now forms a peninsula joined to the mainland by a low isthmus. This harbour, Front Bay, was first used by the ancient Kingdom of Awsan between the 7th to 5th centuries BC. The modern harbour is on the other side of the peninsula.|1
The Arctic ( or ) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost (permanently frozen underground ice) containing tundra. Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places.The Arctic region is a unique area among Earth's ecosystems.|1
