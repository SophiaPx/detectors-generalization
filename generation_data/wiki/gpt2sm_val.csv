"In the philosophy of mathematics, the abstraction of actual infinity involves the acceptance (if the axiom of infinity is included) of infinite entities as given, actual and completed objects. These might include the set of natural numbers, extended real numbers, transfinite numbers, or even an infinite sequence of rational numbers. Actual infinity is to be contrasted with potential infinity, in which a non-terminating process (such as ""add 1 to the previous number"") produces a sequence with no last element, and where each individual result is finite and is achieved in a finite number of steps."|1

A pegmatite is an igneous rock showing a very coarse texture , with large interlocking crystals usually greater in size. Metamorphism  is an ancient and complex process that has led to the formation of a new type of life. The process of metamorphism begins when the Earth's mantle plumes, which were at least as old as the Earth itself, begin to move through the Earth's magnetic field; the magma that eventually solidifies within the mantle rapidly flows out into space. Meteorites become increasingly heavier and heavier as the surface of the Earth continues to increase in temperature, thus increasing the amount of fuel they can use to produce heat.|0

"Humour ( Commonwealth English ) or humor ( American English ) is the tendency of experiences to provoke laughter and other reactions. A range of social behaviours associated with humour, such as laughing and biting, can be distinguished from normal behavioural behaviour in most cases by the occurrence of a negative emotion. In addition to this characteristic, humans also develop a variety of behaviours that may elicit an unusual response in certain situations, notably fear, anxiety and depression, which are common in some cultures. Etymology From Proto-Germanic script meaning ""thing"", it originally came from Late Latin verb meaning ""to go""."|0
In mathematics , the Dirac delta distribution ( distribution ) , also known as the unit impulse symbol , is a mathematical equation that describes the vectorization function of a set . It describes the relative and absolute position of objects in such a coordinate system, which determines how much the direction of the object can be given or not by the inverse of the plane. In order to understand the Dirac delta-distribution , it is necessary to understand some fundamental principles of Euclidean geometry. The main characteristic of the Dirac delta distribution is that it is expressed in units of space, i.e., in radians.|0

A seed is an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering. The formation of the seed is part of the process of reproduction in seed plants, the spermatophytes, including the gymnosperm and angiosperm plants.Seeds are the product of the ripened ovule, after fertilization by pollen and some growth within the mother plant. The embryo develops from the zygote, and the seed coat from the integuments of the ovule. Seeds have been an important development in the reproduction and success of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants, relative to more primitive plants such as ferns, mosses and liverworts, which do not have seeds and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves.|1
In philosophy , systems theory , science , and art , emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have characteristics that can be explained by processes other than a natural phenomena; these characteristics include, for example, how things behave in relation to bodies and environments. The concepts are often applied to objects from different perspectives, each with its own special rules of operation (as opposed to some others), and they vary depending on the context in which they were observed. There are three categories of systems theories developed over the centuries, namely, axiomatic systems theory, empirical systems theory, and structural systems theory .|0

An ion thruster, ion drive, or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. It creates thrust by accelerating ions using electricity.An ion thruster ionizes a neutral gas by extracting some electrons out of atoms, creating a cloud of positive ions. These ion thrusters rely mainly on electrostatics as ions are accelerated by the Coulomb force along an electric field. Temporarily stored electrons are finally reinjected by a neutralizer in the cloud of ions after it has passed through the electrostatic grid, so the gas becomes neutral again and can freely disperse in space without any further electrical interaction with the thruster.|1
An infection is the invasion of an organism 's body tissues by disease-causing agents , their multiplication , and the spread of diseases to the organism itself.

"The oxidation state, or oxidation number, is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to different atoms were fully ionic. It describes the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state may be positive, negative or zero. While fully ionic bonds are not found in nature, many bonds exhibit strong ionicity, making oxidation state a useful predictor of charge.The oxidation state of an atom does not represent the ""real"" formal charge on that atom, or any other actual atomic property."|1

Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton 's third law . When a system expels or accelerates mass from the centre of mass, friction forces it to repel other forces, so that their total kinetic energy can't be measured (in the same way as light). In physics there's only a finite amount of matter in the universe. One possible definition of gravity—that is, the measure of its mass and masslessness—is about 1/9th the number of neutrinos per decibels (m-degrees). This means that every unit of mass is made up of 0.5 times as many protons as the entire mass of matter.|0

The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and most animals including a few fish, and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the air and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing.|1
Coxsackie A virus (CAV) is a cytolytic Coxsackievirus of the Picornaviridae family, an enterovirus (a group containing the polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, and echoviruses).Viral structure and genome Coxsackie A virus is a subgroup of enterovirus A, which are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. Its protective, icosahedral capsid has an external portion that contains sixty copies of viral proteins (VP1,-2,-3) and an internal portion surrounding the RNA genome containing sixty copies of VP4 viral proteins. This capsid mediates cell entry and elicits the humoral immune responses.|1
"In quantum mechanics, counterfactual definiteness (CFD) is the ability to speak ""meaningfully"" of the definiteness of the results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e., the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured). The term ""counterfactual definiteness"" is used in discussions of physics calculations, especially those related to the phenomenon called quantum entanglement and those related to the Bell inequalities. In such discussions ""meaningfully"" means the ability to treat these unmeasured results on an equal footing with measured results in statistical calculations."|1

He started working in London in 1869, after being sent there by his parents.|0
Catalase is a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen (such as bacteria, plants, and animals) which catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. It is a very important enzyme in protecting the cell from oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Catalase has one of the highest turnover numbers of all enzymes; one catalase molecule can convert millions of hydrogen peroxide molecules to water and oxygen each second.Catalase is a tetramer of four polypeptide chains, each over 500 amino acids long. It contains four iron-containing heme groups that allow the enzyme to react with hydrogen peroxide.|1
"Akasha or Akash ( Sanskrit ) means space or sky or æther in traditional Indian cosmology , depending on the language of the country. The ancient Hindu god Sravagatamaka (also called Tathagata, Sutra or Sutta), who was the ancestor of all known Hindus, had been killed in an earthquake during the fourth century BCE. He lived for a period in the fifth century CE. After his death he went to his shrine in Narshekya, where he offered sacrifices to gods, which he accepted. He is also known as Jain, ""the king""."|0
Concurrent Versions System ( CVS , also known as the Concurrent Versioning System ) is a revision control system originally developed by the University of California at Los Angeles during the early 1980s, with the goal of ensuring compatibility with Unix.

"Bi-curious is a term for a person, usually someone who is a heterosexual, who is curious or open about engaging in sexual activity with a person whose sex differs from that of their usual sexual partners. The term is sometimes used to describe a broad continuum of sexual orientation between heterosexuality and bisexuality. Such continuums include mostly-heterosexual or mostly-homosexual, but these can be self-identified without identifying as bisexual. The terms heteroflexible and homoflexible are mainly applied to bi-curious people, though some authors distinguish heteroflexibility and homoflexibility as lacking the ""wish to experiment with sexuality"" implied by the bi-curious label."|1
"The unexpected hanging paradox or surprise test paradox is a paradox about a person's expectations about the timing of a future event which they are told will occur at an unexpected time. The paradox is variously applied to a prisoner's hanging, or a surprise school test. It was first introduced to the public in Martin Gardner's March 1963 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American magazine.There is no consensus on its precise nature and consequently a canonical resolution has not been agreed on. Logical analyses focus on ""truth values"", for example by identifying it as paradox of self-reference."|1
A nuclear thermal rocket ( NTR ) is a type of thermal rocket where the heat from a nuclear reaction heats and cools a propellant unit for a range of temperatures up to 5 degrees. It is particularly useful for space launches; as such it has been used primarily to power the Apollo missions. I don't know if this is in fact related, or if it was an accident. There are some things about these rockets that I cannot say for certain. It's probably not rocket technology as such, though, so I should be cautious.|0

Parasports are sports played by people with a disability , including physical and intellectual disabilities . Some parasports are forms of transport such as public transport or private aircraft. There is also the occasional use of paragliding, which involves taking up to two people on a boat and passing around the water until it reaches one person. These events typically involve multiple participants, many who have different needs than that of each individual participant. In some cases, both parties participate in the participation; others engage in the recreational activity while other members participate only for brief periods. Olympic Games are held in international venues in Asia.|0
The Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk is a high-altitude , remotely-piloted surveillance aircraft . It was initially designed by Ryan McCarron as an air-to-air missile capable of reaching 100,000 ft.

In philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own, properties or behaviors which emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole.Emergence plays a central role in theories of integrative levels and of complex systems. For instance, the phenomenon of life as studied in biology is an emergent property of chemistry, and many psychological phenomena are known to emerge from underlying neurobiological processes.In philosophy, theories that emphasize emergent properties have been called emergentism.In philosophyPhilosophers often understand emergence as a claim about the etiology of a system's properties.|1
Arabidopsis (rockcress) is a genus in the family Brassicaceae. They are small flowering plants related to cabbage and mustard. This genus is of great interest since it contains thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), one of the model organisms used for studying plant biology and the first plant to have its entire genome sequenced. Changes in thale cress are easily observed, making it a very useful model.StatusCurrently, the genus Arabidopsis has nine species and a further eight subspecies recognised. This delimitation is quite recent and is based on morphological and molecular phylogenies by O'Kane and Al-Shehbaz and others.Their findings confirm the species formerly included in Arabidopsis made it polyphyletic.|1

A mass driver or electromagnetic catapult is a proposed method of non-rocket spacelaunch which would use a linear motor to take off the Earth's crust and propel it back into orbit. It is an extremely difficult aerodynamic system and has been discussed as having advantages such as lower velocity (up to 25 kilometers per second), reduced cost (less than US$ 1,000 kg/year), higher thrust, and lower fuel economy. The concept was conceived by physicist Carl Sagan in the 1950s, and eventually became the cornerstone of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory program, and is now the world's most commonly used version of the spacecraft design.|0
The oxidation state , or oxidation number , is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds are bonded to one another. It occurs when the atoms have a total amount of oxidized carbon, such as in a hydrogen atom, because they need to exchange electrons on their way out of contact with each other . In a hydrogen atom, the oxidation number depends on the chemical structure of the bonds between the bonds and can range from 0–100. Korea (모보제, Korean: 문겐 탘), also known as Kim Il Sung-Jong, was a powerful former dictator, who ruled from 1949 to 1964.|0

A seed is an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering . The formation of the seed is part of the natural history of plants. In other plants, seeds are broken up and fertilized with certain kinds of carbohydrates, which are absorbed into the body as energy. Seeds are typically found on plants or in animal tissues such as milkweed and erythritol during their initial germination. They can be harvested from various sources, including the flowering stage (flowering through ripening to maturity) and the fruit cycle (from ripe to late maturity).|0
Fermat 's principle , also known as the principle of least time , is the link between ray optics and optical illusion . Ray optics involve the ability to produce an image at a fixed wavelength, by applying light from a lens, in order to capture an image at a particular focal length, or at a distance, in order to obtain a certain degree of illumination.The principle of least time involves the ability to approximate the properties of an optical fibre, such as its colour and shape (or the size and shape of objects), with relatively short timescales (e.g., 1/120th of a second per pixel).|0

The Little Ice Age (LIA) was a period of regional cooling, particularly pronounced in the North Atlantic region, that occurred after the Medieval Warm Period. It was not a true ice age of global extent. The term was introduced into scientific literature by François E. Matthes in 1939. The time period has been conventionally defined as extending from the 16th to the 19th centuries, but some experts prefer an alternative timespan from about 1300 to about 1850.The NASA Earth Observatory notes three particularly cold intervals. One began about 1650, another about 1770, and the last in 1850, all of which were separated by intervals of slight warming.|1
"Parasports are sports played by people with a disability, including physical and intellectual disabilities. Some parasports are forms of adapted physical activities from existing able-bodied sports, while others have been specifically created for persons with a disability and do not have an able-bodied equivalent. Disability exists in four categories: physical, mental, permanent and temporary. At a competitive level, disability sport classifications are applied to allow people of varying abilities to face similar opposition.EtymologyThe term ""parasports"" arose as a portmanteau of the words paraplegic and sports. Though the sport has since included athletes of disabilities other than paraplegia, the term persists as a catch-all."|1

This list of Anuran families shows all extant families of Anura. Anura is an order of animals in the class Amphibia that includes frogs and toads. More than 5,000 species are described in the order. The living anurans are typically divided into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, Mesobatrachia, and Neobatrachia. This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles.TaxonomyThe archaeobatrachians are the most primitive of frogs. These frogs have morphological characteristics which are found mostly in extinct frogs, and are absent in most of the modern frog species.|1
An adverb is a word or an expression that modifies a verb, adjective, another adverb, determiner, clause, preposition, or sentence. Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as how?, in what way?, when?, where?, and to what extent?. This is called the adverbial function, and may be performed by single words (adverbs) or by multi-word adverbial phrases and adverbial clauses.Adverbs are traditionally regarded as one of the parts of speech.|1

Landslides, also known as landslips, are several forms of mass wasting that may include a wide range of ground movements, such as rockfalls, deep-seated slope failures, mudflows, and debris flows. Landslides occur in a variety of environments, characterized by either steep or gentle slope gradients, from mountain ranges to coastal cliffs or even underwater, in which case they are called submarine landslides. Gravity is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur, but there are other factors affecting slope stability that produce specific conditions that make a slope prone to failure.|1
"A solvent ( from the Latin solvō , `` loosen , untie , solve '' ) is a substance that forms when water vapor is displaced by a hot liquid. It is present primarily in concentrated forms, but also occurs as an insoluble soluble compound.The term solvos is used to indicate a solvent that is readily accessible to the environment.Solvent solvents are classified into four main categories:
solvumabic acid; solvus; solvonate; alkaline; and hydrocyanide. As well as being volatile, solvoids are also known chemically as hydroxyl esters.They are often referred to by some names such as erythema or eryophthalamic acid."|0
"Liberation theology is a Christian theological approach emphasizing the liberation of the oppressed. In certain contexts, it engages socio-economic analyses, with ""social concern for the poor and political liberation for oppressed peoples."" In other contexts, it addresses other forms of inequality, such as race or caste.Liberation theology is best known in the Latin American context, especially within Catholicism in the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council, where it became the political praxis of theologians such as Gustavo Gutiérrez, Leonardo Boff, and Jesuits Juan Luis Segundo and Jon Sobrino, who popularized the phrase ""preferential option for the poor""."|1

Antioch on the Orontes (; , Antiókheia hē epì Oróntou; also Syrian Antioch) was a Hellenistic city side of the Orontes River. Its ruins lie near the current city of Antakya, Turkey, to which the ancient city lends its name.Antioch was founded near the end of the fourth century BC by Seleucus I Nicator, one of Alexander the Great's generals. The city's geographical, military, and economic location benefited its occupants, particularly such features as the spice trade, the Silk Road, and the Royal Road. It eventually rivaled Alexandria as the chief city of the Near East.|1
An inverse multiplexer (often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX) allows a data stream to be broken into multiple lower data rate communication links. An inverse multiplexer differs from a demultiplexer because the multiple output streams from the former stay inter-related, whereas those from the latter are unrelated. An inverse multiplexer is the opposite of a multiplexer  in that it divides one high-speed link into multiple low-speed links, whereas a multiplexer combines multiple low-speed links into one high-speed link.This provides an end to end connection of several times the data rate available on each of the low rate data links.|1

Odoacer often used the Roman honorific patrician, granted by Zeno, but was referred to as a king  in many documents.|1
In academic publishing, a scientific journal is a periodical publication intended to further the progress of science, usually by reporting new research.ContentArticles in scientific journals are mostly written by active scientists such as students, researchers and professors instead of professional journalists. There are thousands of scientific journals in publication, and many more have been published at various points in the past (see list of scientific journals). Most journals are highly specialized, although some of the oldest journals such as Nature publish articles and scientific papers across a wide range of scientific fields.|1
"Fall back is a feature of a modem protocol in data communication whereby two communicating modems which experience data corruption (due to line noise, for example) can renegotiate with each other to use a lower-speed connection. Fall forward is a corresponding feature whereby two modems which have ""fallen back"" to a lower speed can later return to the higher speed if the connection improves.A common feature modems was the concept of fallback, allowing them to talk to less-capable modems. During the call initiation the modem would play a series of signals into the line and wait for the remote modem to ""answer"" them."|1
"Mary Anning ( 21 May 1799 – 9 March 1847 ) was an English fossil collector , dealer , and explorer who built an extensive collection of fossil specimens at a range of sites across the North American continent from Virginia to Canada.

Magma  is the molten or semi-molten natural material from which all igneous rocks are formed. Magma is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and evidence of magmatism has also been discovered on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals and gas bubbles.Magma is produced by melting of the mantle or the crust in various tectonic settings, which on Earth include subduction zones, continental rift zones, mid-ocean ridges and hotspots. Mantle and crustal melts migrate upwards through the crust where they are thought to be stored in magma chambers or trans-crustal crystal-rich mush zones.|1

"The Maunder Minimum, also known as the ""prolonged sunspot minimum"", was a period around 1645 to 1715 during which sunspots became exceedingly rare. During a 28-year period (1672–1699) within the minimum, observations revealed fewer than 50 sunspots. This contrasts with the typical 40,000–50,000 sunspots seen in modern times over a similar timespan.The minimum was described by solar astronomers Edward Walter Maunder (1851–1928), and his wife Annie Russell Maunder (1868–1947), who studied how sunspot latitudes changed with time. Two papers were published in Edward Maunder's name in 1890 and 1894, and he cited earlier papers written by Gustav Spörer."|1

"In celestial mechanics, escape velocity or escape speed is the minimum speed needed for a free, non-propelled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a primary body, thus reaching an infinite distance from it. It is typically stated as an ideal speed, ignoring atmospheric friction. Although the term ""escape velocity"" is common, it is more accurately described as a speed than a velocity because it is independent of direction; the escape speed increases with the mass of the primary body and decreases with the distance from the primary body."|1

"The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one that has exactly zero and the value of any other integer. Since it's impossible to define a function which takes the first non-zero bit, we can't prove its identity by adding more or removing the remainder. In his classic text on mathematical proofs, Thomas Schelling describes the notion of proof as ""a method for determining how far an assertion can be regarded as certain."" His definition is useful for proving beyond doubt that some statements are true, but not necessarily true itself."|0

"Fermat's principle, also known as the principle of least time, is the link between ray optics and wave optics. In its original ""strong"" form, Fermat's principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time. In order to be true in all cases, this statement must be weakened by replacing the ""least"" time with a time that is ""stationary"" with respect to variations of the path — so that a deviation in the path causes, at most, a second-order change in the traversal time."|1

"In celestial mechanics , escape velocity or escape speed is the minimum speed needed for a free , non-propelled object to be propelled. However, space travel is extremely unstable because its orbit does not change very quickly; the orbits of the most common stars have a radius between one and ten times larger than their orbital motion relative to the Sun. Galaxies in the human galaxy are made up of many tiny, massive particles called subatomic particles. These nuclei contain only a few billion elements (about 100,000 atoms) that interact with each other and are called the ""superluminous""."|0

A hybrid-propellant rocket is a rocket with a rocket motor that uses rocket propellants in two different phases: one solid and the other either gas or liquid. The hybrid rocket concept can be traced back to at least the 1930s.Hybrid rockets avoid some of the disadvantages of solid rockets like the dangers of propellant handling, while also avoiding some disadvantages of liquid rockets like their mechanical complexity. Because it is difficult for the fuel and oxidizer to be mixed intimately (being different states of matter), hybrid rockets tend to fail more benignly than liquids or solids.|1

Thermonuclear fusion is the process of atoms combining or “ fusing ” together with huge amounts of heat . There are two distinct approaches to such fusion. The simplest form is the use of hydrogen peroxide (HPA), an inert gas, which is produced by converting oxygen in a solution of water vapor into protons (particles) that fuse at a higher velocity; this technique can be used to accelerate the formation of nuclear fission reactions, though it has drawbacks. In the second method, where electrons are converted into hydrogen ions and stored in the nucleus for future fusion reactions, HPA is depleted and cannot be replaced.|0

"Isotope separation is the process of concentrating specific isotopes of a chemical element by removing other isotopes. The use of the nuclides produced is varied. The largest variety is used in research (e.g. in chemistry where atoms of ""marker"" nuclide are used to figure out reaction mechanisms). By tonnage, separating natural uranium into enriched uranium and depleted uranium is the largest application. In the following text, mainly the uranium enrichment is considered. This process is crucial in the manufacture of uranium fuel for nuclear power plants, and is also required for the creation of uranium-based nuclear weapons."|1

In economics, inflation refers to a general progressive increase in prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. The opposite of inflation is deflation, a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualised percentage change in a general price index.Prices will not all increase at the same rates. Attaching a representative value to a set of prices is an instance of the index number problem.|1

"The Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT, also called block-sorting compression) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters. This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by techniques such as move-to-front transform and run-length encoding. More importantly, the transformation is reversible, without needing to store any additional data except the position of the first original character. The BWT is thus a ""free"" method of improving the efficiency of text compression algorithms, costing only some extra computation."|1

"A seal is a device for making an impression in wax, clay, paper, or some other medium, including an embossment on paper, and is also the impression thus made. The original purpose was to authenticate a document, or to prevent interference with a package or envelope by applying a seal which had to be broken to open the container (hence the modern English verb ""to seal"", which implies secure closing without an actual wax seal).The seal-making device is also referred to as the seal matrix or die; the imprint it creates as the seal impression (or, more rarely, the sealing)."|1
A half reaction ( or half-cell reaction ) is either the oxidation or reduction reaction component of a redox reaction. A half reaction is usually an incomplete reaction and therefore contains only a very small portion of the total reaction mass. As such, its final result may differ from the original value that was calculated for each reaction in the prior reaction. To determine the actual value of a reaction in relation to the reactivity of different components of the same chemical molecule, it is sufficient to consider the amount of energy required to complete both reactions. Nanotechnology refers to chemicals that are used in biomedical research.|0

The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. It  concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.The conjecture is named after mathematician Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate.|1
Westminster is an area of Central London , part of the wider City of Westminster.The area , which extends from West to North Kensington , has been in use for decades as a military base for RAF fighter jets, Royal Navy warships and naval ships. It is also home to the Metropolitan Police Headquarters (MPH) headquarters. I'm not sure whether it would have been legal to build a bridge on Topbridge Road, since there is a lot of evidence suggesting that one might need to pay more than £6 per hour. It would probably be quite expensive, but it would be worth the risk.|0

Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle. In eukaryotes, there are two distinct types of cell division; a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell (mitosis), and a reproductive cell division, whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce haploid gametes (meiosis). In cell biology, mitosis (/maɪˈtoʊsɪs/) is a part of the cell cycle, in which, replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei.|1
"Emissions trading is a market-based approach to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives for reducing the emissions of pollutants. The concept is also known as cap and trade (CAT) or emissions trading scheme (ETS). Carbon emission trading for  and other greenhouse gases has been introduced in China, the European Union and other countries as a key tool for climate change mitigation. Other schemes include sulfur dioxide and other pollutants.In an emissions trading scheme, a central authority or governmental body allocates or sells a limited number (a ""cap"") of permits that allow a discharge of a specific quantity of a specific pollutant over a set time period."|1

Metaphone is a phonetic algorithm, published by Lawrence Philips in 1990, for indexing words by their English pronunciation. It fundamentally improves on the Soundex algorithm by using information about variations and inconsistencies in English spelling and pronunciation to produce a more accurate encoding, which does a better job of matching words and names which sound similar. As with Soundex, similar-sounding words should share the same keys. Metaphone is available as a built-in operator in a number of systems.Philips later produced a new version of the algorithm, which he named Double Metaphone.|1

Genus  (plural genera ) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms as well as viruses. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.E.g. Panthera leo (lion) and Panthera onca (jaguar) are two species within the genus Panthera. Panthera is a genus within the family Felidae.The composition of a genus is determined by taxonomists. The standards for genus classification are not strictly codified, so different authorities often produce different classifications for genera.|1

The bowline ( or ) is an ancient and simple knot used to form a fixed loop at the end of a rope. It has the virtues of being both easy to tie and untie; most notably, it is easy to untie after being subjected to a load. The bowline is sometimes referred to as King of the knots because of its importance. Along with the sheet bend and the clove hitch, the bowline is often considered one of the most essential knots. The common bowline shares some structural similarity with the sheet bend. Virtually all end-to-end joining knots (i.e., bends) have a corresponding loop knot.|1
Relative density , or specific gravity , is the ratio of the density ( mass of a unit volume ) and the absolute amount of energy released by a fluid body during an electric charge. The Earth's orbit is the planet-wide equatorial area of the Sun, which extends to about 3,500 kilometers across (1,200 miles) in all directions from the South Pole . Its position in the solar system is determined by its angular momentum, while its orbit is determined by its eccentricity.The Earth orbits the sun every 10 days and the moon orbits it every 7.2 days.|0

"Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are often caught in the wild but may also be caught from stocked bodies of water. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. ""Fishing"" may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate. In addition to being caught to be eaten, fish are caught as recreational pastimes."|1

Loris is the common name for the strepsirrhine mammals of the subfamily Lorinae (sometimes spelled Lorisinae) in the family Lorisidae. Loris is one genus in this subfamily and includes the slender lorises, while Nycticebus is the genus containing the slow lorises.DescriptionLorises are nocturnal and arboreal. They are found in tropical and woodland forests of India, Sri Lanka, and parts of southeast Asia. Loris locomotion is a slow and cautious climbing form of quadrupedalism. Some lorises are almost entirely insectivorous, while others also include fruits, gums, leaves, and slugs in their diet.Female lorises practice infant parking, leaving their infants behind in nests.|1
A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied , tailless amphibians composing the order Cetacea, Euphaetidae, and Amphibia.
