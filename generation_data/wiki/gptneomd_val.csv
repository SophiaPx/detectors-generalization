An ion thruster, ion drive, or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. It creates thrust by accelerating ions using electricity.An ion thruster ionizes a neutral gas by extracting some electrons out of atoms, creating a cloud of positive ions. These ion thrusters rely mainly on electrostatics as ions are accelerated by the Coulomb force along an electric field. Temporarily stored electrons are finally reinjected by a neutralizer in the cloud of ions after it has passed through the electrostatic grid, so the gas becomes neutral again and can freely disperse in space without any further electrical interaction with the thruster.|1
Today's New International Version (TNIV) is an English translation of the Bible which was developed by the Committee on Bible Translation (CBT). The CBT also developed the New International Version (NIV) in the 1970s. The TNIV is based on the NIV.

The complete Bible was published in February 2005. The rights to the text are owned by Biblica (formerly International Bible Society). Zondervan published the TNIV in North America.|1
"The Ante-Nicene Fathers, subtitled ""The Writings of the Fathers Down to A.D. 325"", is a collection of books in 10 volumes (one volume is indexes) containing English translations of the majority of Early Christian writings. The period covers the beginning of Christianity until the promulgation of the Nicene Creed at the First Council of Nicaea.PublicationThe series was originally published between 1867 and 1873 by the Presbyterian publishing house T. & T. Clark in Edinburgh under the title Ante-Nicene Christian Library (ANCL), as a response to the Oxford movement's Library of the Fathers which was perceived as too strongly identified with the Anglo-Catholic movement."|1
"Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare. Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the history of England, they were classified as ""histories"" in the First Folio. The Roman tragedies—Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus—are also based on historical figures, but because their sources were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories. Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy."|1
Tajiks (, Tājīk, Tājek; ) are a Persian-speaking Iranian ethnic group native to Central Asia, living primarily in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Tajiks are the largest ethnicity in Tajikistan, and the second-largest in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. They speak varieties of Persian, a Western Iranian language. In Tajikistan, since the 1939 Soviet census, its small Pamiri and Yaghnobi ethnic groups are included as Tajiks.

"Genus ( plural genera ) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms as a means of identifying them. The generic name is a Latin adjective, from the Greek word γάλλιος (genos), meaning ""a whole"". Genus is also a noun from the Greek verb γοίνικον (genos) ""to generate, form, number"" and the neuter plural is genitrōpōn, ""generations"". The word genus refers to all living species of a single taxonomic rank. This is similar to the word ""family"" and ""order"" used as nouns."|0

Examples of this can include disciplinary action for rule infractions and deciding on rulechanges in the sport that they govern. Governing bodies have different scopes. They may cover a range of sport at an international level, such as the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee, or only a single sport at a national level, such as the Rugby Football League. National bodies will largely have to be affiliated with international bodies for the same sport.|1
"A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura (literally without tail in Ancient Greek). The oldest fossil ""proto-frog"" Triadobatrachus is known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their split from other amphibians may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforest. Frogs account for around 88% of extant amphibian species."|1

A seed is an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering. The formation of the seed is part of the process of reproduction in seed plants, the spermatophytes, including the gymnosperm and angiosperm plants.Seeds are the product of the ripened ovule, after fertilization by pollen and some growth within the mother plant. The embryo develops from the zygote, and the seed coat from the integuments of the ovule. Seeds have been an important development in the reproduction and success of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants, relative to more primitive plants such as ferns, mosses and liverworts, which do not have seeds and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves.|1

The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and most animals including a few fish, and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the air and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing.|1
Catalase is a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen (such as bacteria, plants, and animals) which catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. It is a very important enzyme in protecting the cell from oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Catalase has one of the highest turnover numbers of all enzymes; one catalase molecule can convert millions of hydrogen peroxide molecules to water and oxygen each second.Catalase is a tetramer of four polypeptide chains, each over 500 amino acids long. It contains four iron-containing heme groups that allow the enzyme to react with hydrogen peroxide.|1

"The Maunder Minimum, also known as the ""prolonged sunspot minimum"", was a period around 1645 to 1715 during which sunspots became exceedingly rare. During a 28-year period (1672–1699) within the minimum, observations revealed fewer than 50 sunspots. This contrasts with the typical 40,000–50,000 sunspots seen in modern times over a similar timespan.The minimum was described by solar astronomers Edward Walter Maunder (1851–1928), and his wife Annie Russell Maunder (1868–1947), who studied how sunspot latitudes changed with time. Two papers were published in Edward Maunder's name in 1890 and 1894, and he cited earlier papers written by Gustav Spörer."|1
"In celestial mechanics, escape velocity or escape speed is the minimum speed needed for a free, non-propelled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a primary body, thus reaching an infinite distance from it. It is typically stated as an ideal speed, ignoring atmospheric friction. Although the term ""escape velocity"" is common, it is more accurately described as a speed than a velocity because it is independent of direction; the escape speed increases with the mass of the primary body and decreases with the distance from the primary body."|1

The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. It  concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.The conjecture is named after mathematician Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate.|1

A mass driver or electromagnetic catapult is a proposed method of non-rocket spacelaunch which would use a linear motor to accelerate and catapult payloads up to high speeds. Existing and contemplated mass drivers use coils of wire energized by electricity to make electromagnets, though a rotary mass driver has also been proposed. Sequential firing of a row of electromagnets accelerates the payload along a path. After leaving the path, the payload continues to move due to momentum.Although any device used to propel a ballistic payload is technically a mass driver, in this context a mass driver is essentially a coilgun that magnetically accelerates a package consisting of a magnetizable holder containing a payload.|1
In economics , inflation refers to a general progressive increase in prices of goods and services in an economy .

In electronics, a multiplexer (or mux; spelled sometimes as multiplexor), also known as a data selector, is a device that selects between several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line. The selection is directed by a separate set of digital inputs known as select lines. A multiplexer of  inputs has  select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output.A multiplexer makes it possible for several input signals to share one device or resource, for example, one analog-to-digital converter or one communications transmission medium, instead of having one device per input signal.|1

"Parasports are sports played by people with a disability, including physical and intellectual disabilities. Some parasports are forms of adapted physical activities from existing able-bodied sports, while others have been specifically created for persons with a disability and do not have an able-bodied equivalent. Disability exists in four categories: physical, mental, permanent and temporary. At a competitive level, disability sport classifications are applied to allow people of varying abilities to face similar opposition.EtymologyThe term ""parasports"" arose as a portmanteau of the words paraplegic and sports. Though the sport has since included athletes of disabilities other than paraplegia, the term persists as a catch-all."|1

The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one or another integer with the same number of digits. If this were so, it would give the answer to the famous Collatz conjecture, asking whether there exists a sequence of primes that repeats itself infinitely many times. But this is no longer possible. In 2002, however, a new approach was invented that turned the idea that a sequence of integers that repeats itself indefinitely should eventually converge to an integer with just one digit, which is the famous Fermat–Weber theorem, on the way.|0

Garnets are a group of silicate minerals that have been used since the Bronze Age as gemstones and abrasives.All species in this mineral class are typically formed from monosilicate (MgO) precursors which crystallize to octosilicate with Mg(2)(SiO4) and FeO (Fe2O3) phases. The presence of both Fe- and Al-containing minerals in garnets is believed to be the key to understanding garnet chemistry and properties. In addition, a variety of garnet mineral phases, some with different compositions and properties, are reported to be the end product of the garnet crystallization process.|0

In their most common sense , the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of any physical processes, such as the body in which they operate. However, as noted in the previous two sections, these two ideas can be used to describe a wide range of different cognitive processes. The word “think” can thus be used to refer to any one of the above cognitive processes. This does not exclude that a thought can also be produced through the process of the physical body. It is often assumed that there are only two processes that cause thought: the brain and the brainstem.|0

An inverse multiplexer (often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX) allows a data stream to be broken into multiple lower data rate communication links. An inverse multiplexer differs from a demultiplexer because the multiple output streams from the former stay inter-related, whereas those from the latter are unrelated. An inverse multiplexer is the opposite of a multiplexer  in that it divides one high-speed link into multiple low-speed links, whereas a multiplexer combines multiple low-speed links into one high-speed link.This provides an end to end connection of several times the data rate available on each of the low rate data links.|1

"In quantum mechanics, counterfactual definiteness (CFD) is the ability to speak ""meaningfully"" of the definiteness of the results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e., the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured). The term ""counterfactual definiteness"" is used in discussions of physics calculations, especially those related to the phenomenon called quantum entanglement and those related to the Bell inequalities. In such discussions ""meaningfully"" means the ability to treat these unmeasured results on an equal footing with measured results in statistical calculations."|1

"In the philosophy of mathematics, the abstraction of actual infinity involves the acceptance (if the axiom of infinity is included) of infinite entities as given, actual and completed objects. These might include the set of natural numbers, extended real numbers, transfinite numbers, or even an infinite sequence of rational numbers. Actual infinity is to be contrasted with potential infinity, in which a non-terminating process (such as ""add 1 to the previous number"") produces a sequence with no last element, and where each individual result is finite and is achieved in a finite number of steps."|1

Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle. In eukaryotes, there are two distinct types of cell division; a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell (mitosis), and a reproductive cell division, whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce haploid gametes (meiosis). In cell biology, mitosis (/maɪˈtoʊsɪs/) is a part of the cell cycle, in which, replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei.|1
SPARC (Scalable Processor Architecture) is a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) instruction set architecture originally developed by Sun Microsystems.

A radionuclide (radioactive nuclide, radioisotope or radioactive isotope) is a nuclide that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. This excess energy can be used in one of three ways: emitted from the nucleus as gamma radiation; transferred to one of its electrons to release it as a conversion electron; or used to create and emit a new particle (alpha particle or beta particle) from the nucleus. During those processes, the radionuclide is said to undergo radioactive decay. These emissions are considered ionizing radiation because they are powerful enough to liberate an electron from another atom.|1
While a significant majority of water vessels are powered by diesel engines, with sail power and gasoline engines also popular, boats powered by electricity have been used for over 120 years. Electric boats were very popular from the 1880s until the 1920s, when the internal combustion engine became dominant. Since the energy crises of the 1970s, interest in this quiet and potentially renewable marine energy source has been increasing steadily, especially as more efficient solar cells have become available, for the first time making possible motorboats with an infinite range like sailboats. The first practical solar boat was probably constructed in 1975 in England.|1

"A monopropellant rocket (or ""monochemical rocket"") is a rocket that uses a single chemical as its propellant.Chemical-reaction monopropellant rocketsFor monopropellant rockets that depend on a chemical reaction, the power for the propulsive reaction and resultant thrust is provided by the chemical itself. That is, the energy needed to propel the spacecraft is contained within the chemical bonds of the chemical molecules involved in the reaction.The most commonly used monopropellant is hydrazine (N2H4), a chemical which is a strong reducing agent. The most common catalyst is granular alumina (aluminum oxide) coated with iridium."|1

The covalent radius, rcov, is a measure of the size of an atom that forms part of one covalent bond. It is usually measured either in picometres (pm) or angstroms (Å), with 1 Å = 100 pm.In principle, the sum of the two covalent radii should equal the covalent bond length between two atoms, R(AB) = r(A) + r(B). Moreover, different radii can be introduced for single, double and triple bonds (r1, r2 and r3 below), in a purely operational sense.|1

"The oxidation state, or oxidation number, is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to different atoms were fully ionic. It describes the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state may be positive, negative or zero. While fully ionic bonds are not found in nature, many bonds exhibit strong ionicity, making oxidation state a useful predictor of charge.The oxidation state of an atom does not represent the ""real"" formal charge on that atom, or any other actual atomic property."|1
Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion (SCUMM) is a video game engine developed at Lucasfilm Games, later renamed LucasArts, to ease development on their graphic adventure game Maniac Mansion (1987). It was subsequently used as the engine for later LucasArts adventure games.It falls somewhere between a game engine and a programming language, allowing designers to create locations, items and dialogue sequences without writing code in the language in which the game source code ends up. This also allowed the game's script and data files to be cross-platform, i.e., re-used across various platforms.|1
"Relative density , or specific gravity , is the ratio of the density ( mass of a unit volume ) of a solid phase to the density of a vapor phase. The specific gravities of most solids fall into one of two categories, based on their melting or boiling temperatures. In the former category, all solid materials will melt at temperatures below about 200 °C; in the latter class, all solid solids will boil at the same temperature above about 300 °C. Solids can be classified in many ways. Some examples include:

The History of East Asia generally encompasses the histories of China , Japan , Korea , and Mongolia from prehistoric times to the present day. This is because ancient China was, for the first time in recorded history, the homeland of mankind. This was the earliest of the human civilizations, the Indus Valley Civilization, which is sometimes referred to as the “Greater Asian” region. This is the reason why so many Chinese historical works are translated into English and other languages, such as Korean , Japanese , and Russian .|0
An inverse multiplexer ( often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX ) allows a data stream to be broken into multiple pieces at different rates. The data stream can be broken into segments with different lengths (or multiple rates) that are sent over a data link. The pieces of data that are received at the receiving side are broken up again. The inverse multiplexer has several interfaces that allow the pieces of data that have been received by the receiving side to be reconstructed. One of these interfaces is, for example, the interface for the physical layer that is used for transmitting physical layer packets.|0

Wind tunnels are large tubes with air blowing through them which are used to replicate the interaction between air and solid matter. They are an excellent way of creating a 3D simulation of an airflow or the movement of material. For example, in the case of building a wind tunnel it is very common to use a wind tunnel as a form of training or education. In order to build a wind tunnel you must first decide what the shape of the tunnel should be. This can be done using the CAD software, but this is usually only an option if it has a 3D CAD program available.|0

A hybrid-propellant rocket is a rocket with a rocket motor that uses rocket propellants in two different phases : one in the propulsion chamber of the rocket engine and another in the rocket body. The rocket body is usually the engine case but can be a metal or plastic casing or an internal container. The propellant in the propellant chamber can be either liquid or solid. Rocket propellants are liquid fuels that use oxygen or liquid oxygen (LOX/LOX+O2) as oxidizer. Other propellants can also be used but are more difficult to produce. The propellant chamber is usually the engine case but can be a container for fuel or solid propellant.|0

"Fermat's principle, also known as the principle of least time, is the link between ray optics and wave optics. In its original ""strong"" form, Fermat's principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time. In order to be true in all cases, this statement must be weakened by replacing the ""least"" time with a time that is ""stationary"" with respect to variations of the path — so that a deviation in the path causes, at most, a second-order change in the traversal time."|1
"A beta particle , also called beta ray or beta radiation ( symbol β ) , is a high-energy , high-frequency gamma ray of more than 3 keV that emanates from radioactive decays of certain isotopes of cesium ( ^ 137Cs) and rubidium ( ^ 191Ru )
The beta particle is one of the three main types of high energy gamma rays ( the others being X-rays and gamma rays ), and the first of them to be discovered. It has a wavelength equal to the distance it travels in one oscillation and is emitted from an object when that object undergoes an atomic decay."|0

"The Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT, also called block-sorting compression) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters. This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by techniques such as move-to-front transform and run-length encoding. More importantly, the transformation is reversible, without needing to store any additional data except the position of the first original character. The BWT is thus a ""free"" method of improving the efficiency of text compression algorithms, costing only some extra computation."|1
Niacin , also known as nicotinic acid , is an organic compound and a form of vitamin B3 , an important component of red blood cells. Niacin is mainly converted into NAD and nicotinamide in the human body during the process of cell respiration. Although niacin has the function of improving the function of erythrocytes in the whole body, it can not only be converted into NAD but also converted into nicotinamide, which is the first step in the cellular energy pathway. Nicotinamide can then be converted into NAD+ which can be utilized for the energy production in cells, tissues, and organs \[[@B1]\].|0

The Maunder Minimum , also known as the `` prolonged sunspot minimum '' , was a period around 1645 to 1730 in Europe , which saw a massive period of solar maximum. In the 1640s solar activity fell to its lowest state in over two millennia. For the next 20 to 40 years solar activity was relatively calm, but after around 1650 it suddenly began to become stronger. It was during the Maunder Minimum in the late 18th to early 19th century that we started to see a dramatic increase in solar activity, which lasted for approximately 30 years until around 1820, then fell below the average for at least a century.|0
"Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to femininity and masculinity and differentiating between them. Depending on the context, this may include sex-based social structures (i.e. gender roles) and gender identity. Most cultures use a gender binary, having two genders (boys/men and girls/women); those who exist outside these groups may fall under the umbrella term non-binary. Some societies have specific genders besides ""man"" and ""woman"", such as the hijras of South Asia; these are often referred to as third genders (and fourth genders, etc.)."|1
