In physics , optical depth or optical thickness is the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant energy in an object's optical path. When a wave propagates through a water-filled pipe, the intensity of its reflection and emission will be directly proportional to the wavelength of the light emitted by the pipe; otherwise, the waves would not be reflected. However, most materials absorb radiation at much higher radiated intensities than air particles. For example, it is widely accepted that water vapor (from evaporation) reflects about 1/50th as much radiation as all other elements combined when it collides with air.|0

Acetic acid bacteria ( AAB ) are a group of Gram-negative bacteria which oxidize sugars or ethanol and produce acetic acid, an alkaline hydrocarbon which can be used as a fuel.Acetic acid is produced by aerobic bacteria when they use the energy from the burning of glucose and alcohol to create enzymes capable of metabolizing these sugars into acetyl-CoA. It is used as a source of energy for organisms such as humans but it has no nutritional value due to the low rate of metabolism.

The idea was that as type Ia supernovae have almost the same intrinsic brightness (a standard candle), and since objects that are further away appear dimmer, we can use the observed brightness of these supernovae to measure the distance to them.|1

A conjugate acid, within the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, is a  chemical compound formed when an acid donates a proton (H+) to a base—in other words, it is a base with a hydrogen ion added to it, as in the reverse reaction it loses a hydrogen ion. On the other hand, a conjugate base is what is left over after an acid has donated a proton during a chemical reaction. Hence, a conjugate base is a species formed by the removal of a proton from an acid, as in the reverse reaction it is able to gain a hydrogen ion.|1

An example of such a hyperplane would be the sphere of radius 4 in the Euclidean plane.An-spheres are formed through the operation of differential spaces, where one space is connected with another via an algebraic link. These spaces are non-homomorphic to normal spaces and thus have special properties such as finite dimensions (e.g. 1), etc. An an-sphere is defined as the region containing the most vertices of a polygon.|0

In mathematics, two sets are said to be disjoint sets if they have no element in common. Equivalently, two disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is the empty set. For example, {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are disjoint sets, while {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5} are not disjoint. A collection of more than two sets is called disjoint if any two distinct sets of the collection are disjoint.GeneralizationsThis definition of disjoint sets can be extended to a family of sets : the family is pairwise disjoint, or mutually disjoint if  whenever .|1
