A half reaction (or half-cell reaction) is either the oxidation or reduction reaction component of a redox reaction. A half reaction is obtained by considering the change in oxidation states of individual substances involved in the redox reaction.Often, the concept of half reactions is used to describe what occurs in an electrochemical cell, such as a Galvanic cell battery. Half reactions can be written to describe both the metal undergoing oxidation (known as the anode) and the metal undergoing reduction (known as the cathode).Half reactions are often used as a method of balancing redox reactions.|1

The Hippocratic Oath is an oath of ethics historically taken by physicians. It is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. In its original form, it requires a new physician to swear, by a number of healing gods, to uphold specific ethical standards. The oath is the earliest expression of medical ethics in the Western world, establishing several principles of medical ethics which remain of paramount significance today. These include the principles of medical confidentiality and non-maleficence. As the seminal articulation of certain principles that continue to guide and inform medical practice, the ancient text is of more than historic and symbolic value.|1

In the philosophy of mathematics , the abstraction of actual infinity involves the acceptance ( if the axiom of infinity is correct ) of the axiom that, for any infinite sequence { 1, . . . , n } of objects, there is some n such that for every i, the i th element of the sequence is the only element in the sequence whose index is smaller than or equal to i. In this way, the infinite sequence may be reduced to an ordinal number, and hence to a class of objects, while the axiom of infinity maintains its validity in terms of such sequences.|0

"Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare. Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the history of England, they were classified as ""histories"" in the First Folio. The Roman tragedies—Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus—are also based on historical figures, but because their sources were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories. Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy."|1

"Fermat's principle, also known as the principle of least time, is the link between ray optics and wave optics. In its original ""strong"" form, Fermat's principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time. In order to be true in all cases, this statement must be weakened by replacing the ""least"" time with a time that is ""stationary"" with respect to variations of the path — so that a deviation in the path causes, at most, a second-order change in the traversal time."|1

Emissions trading is a market-based approach to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives for reducing the emissions of pollutants . Emissions trading was first proposed by the Organisation for Economic Development and Reconstruction (OEDR) in 1974, with the support of several environmental organizations. These organizations proposed establishing a market-based regime in which emission credits would be traded for the reduction or removal of specific pollutants. It was first implemented on a pilot basis in France in 1981, but was not formally enacted into law until 1996. Today, more than 300 jurisdictions have established a trading system to reduce pollution or promote environmental sustainability .|0

But Pacini's operas were ""rather superficial"", a fact which, later, he candidly admitted in his Memoirs."|1
Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton's third law. When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction, the accelerated mass will cause a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction to be applied to that system.The force applied on a surface in a direction perpendicular or normal to the surface is also called thrust. Force, and thus thrust, is measured using the International System of Units (SI) in newtons (symbol: N), and represents the amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 meter per second per second.|1

The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. It  concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.The conjecture is named after mathematician Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate.|1

Mystery religions, mystery cults, sacred mysteries or simply mysteries, were religious schools of the Greco-Roman world for which participation was reserved to initiates (mystai). The main characterization of this religion is the secrecy associated with the particulars of the initiation and the ritual practice, which may not be revealed to outsiders. The most famous mysteries of Greco-Roman antiquity were the Eleusinian Mysteries, which were of considerable antiquity and predated the Greek Dark Ages. The mystery schools flourished in Late Antiquity; Julian the Apostate in the mid 4th century is known to have been initiated into three distinct mystery schools—most notably the mithraists.|1

The subset sum problem ( SSP ) is a decision problem in computer science . In its most general formulation, it is the problem of deciding whether the number of subsets of a given number of objects taken from a finite collection is at least as large as the given number. It is also known that this problem is NP-complete . In a simpler form, the set of subsets is a sequence of distinct objects, one from each class, and we are asked whether the set is equal to any given set. In other words, the task is to detect whether a given set contains a given element.|0
Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton 's third law . When a system expels or accelerates mass from or to a specified point , its net force is directly related to the acceleration of the point . This is why we say that a system is acting on itself. When we exert or receive a force, we are also applying a torque or resisting an impulse . A system exerts thrust when its force and the force of the force are equal . If the mass of the system does not change, thrust is also a resultant of the forces applied to the system by the torque of the system.|0

A software bug is an error , flaw or fault in computer software that causes it to produce an incorrect result (the result of the program is incorrect). These bugs may not always have clear symptoms, but the cause may be subtle. It is not always practical to isolate the cause of a software bug , and so it is often difficult to tell how a program is going to behave if it were to encounter a particular bug. A good way to deal with these problems is to understand the causes of the problem and how they relate.|0

Some people who play parasports for an intellectual or physical disability are themselves people with disabilities themselves, and others have a disability that affects their performance. Some parasports require a certain type of disability (e.g. a wheelchair athlete is required to be able to run, jump, throw, throw accurately, and so on), but some do not, and many do not require any specific disability.|0

An ion thruster, ion drive, or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. It creates thrust by accelerating ions using electricity.An ion thruster ionizes a neutral gas by extracting some electrons out of atoms, creating a cloud of positive ions. These ion thrusters rely mainly on electrostatics as ions are accelerated by the Coulomb force along an electric field. Temporarily stored electrons are finally reinjected by a neutralizer in the cloud of ions after it has passed through the electrostatic grid, so the gas becomes neutral again and can freely disperse in space without any further electrical interaction with the thruster.|1

In chemistry, a nucleophile is a chemical species that forms bonds with electrophiles by donating an electron pair. All molecules and ions with a free pair of electrons or at least one pi bond can act as nucleophiles. Because nucleophiles donate electrons, they are Lewis bases. Nucleophilic describes the affinity of a nucleophile to bond with positively charged atomic nuclei. Nucleophilicity, sometimes referred to as nucleophile strength, refers to a substance's nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the affinity of atoms. Neutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohols and water are named solvolysis.|1

Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion (SCUMM) is a video game engine developed at Lucasfilm Games, later renamed LucasArts, to ease development on their graphic adventure game Maniac Mansion (1987). It was subsequently used as the engine for later LucasArts adventure games.It falls somewhere between a game engine and a programming language, allowing designers to create locations, items and dialogue sequences without writing code in the language in which the game source code ends up. This also allowed the game's script and data files to be cross-platform, i.e., re-used across various platforms.|1
Auger electron spectroscopy ( AES ; pronounced in French ) is a common analytical technique used specifically in the study of cosmic rays and in medical research. These high energy cosmic particles are responsible for more than 90% of the radiation dose we receive throughout our lifetimes. The majority of this radiation is electromagnetic, but it is composed of electrons that are also known as the primary cosmic ray particles. The energies of these particles range from 10^8 to greater than 10^15 electron volts (EV). At energies between these two extremes, there are secondary particles produced, which we refer to as electrons and positrons (e^-/^+).|0
Enriched uranium is a type of uranium in which the percent composition of uranium-235 ( written 235U ) has been increased over that which naturally occurs in natural uranium. A variety of processes have been devised to enrich uranium over the natural uranium content. One method is to separate uranium into a low enrichment uranium, also called depleted uranium (DU), with a higher percentage of U235, and then extract or recover the DU from the enrichment process. The enriched uranium is called UF6. In a nuclear reactor, UF6 is the core fuel that keeps the reactor cool and generates the electrical power.|0

Loris is the common name for the strepsirrhine mammals of the subfamily Lorinae ( sometimes spelled Lorisinae ) in the order Chiroptera . This group was originally divided into two tribes (Chrysochloridae and Stenocercidae), but later was split into at least two subfamilies: Stenocercinae , comprising only the North American subfamily Stenocercinae , and Lorinae , comprising the rest of the family. All the taxa of this group are thought to have descended from ancestral strepsirrhine-like primates (Chiroptera: Phaneroptera), but there are numerous exceptions and uncertainties, not the least because the precise relationship of most of these taxa is uncertain.|0
Hugh John Lofting (14 January 1886 – 26 September 1947) was an English author trained as a civil engineer, who created the classic children's literature character of Doctor Dolittle.

Schubert initially worked on the overture to his Opus 111 , but the piece never reached completion. The score was then used as the basis for a second opera, Das Wirbelthimer. In 1905, the first version of the work was performed in Munich. While the performance was successful, there were two problems: one, the cast included many women, two, it was an opera buffa."|0
Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents. Legal adoptions permanently transfer all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parents to the adoptive parents.Unlike guardianship or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption, while others used less formal means (notably contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of filiation).|1
A beta particle, also called beta ray or beta radiation (symbol β), is a high-energy, high-speed electron or positron emitted by the radioactive decay of an atomic nucleus during the process of beta decay. There are two forms of beta decay, β− decay and β+ decay, which produce electrons and positrons respectively.Beta particles with an energy of 0.5 MeV have a range of about one metre in air; the distance is dependent on the particle energy.Beta particles are a type of ionizing radiation and for radiation protection purposes are regarded as being more ionising than gamma rays, but less ionising than alpha particles.|1

A beta particle , also called beta ray or beta radiation ( symbol β ) , is a high-energy , charged particle that is emitted from the decay of an atomic nucleus. It is emitted in the direction that is parallel to the atomic nucleus and is therefore also termed an isotropic particle. The term was first proposed by Max von Laue, who first predicted the energy spectrum of beta photons in a series of papers in 1926. In its most common manifestation, a beta particle consists of two electrons, one of which has become an antiparticle, i.e. has the opposite charge and mass.|0
"The Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT, also called block-sorting compression) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters. This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by techniques such as move-to-front transform and run-length encoding. More importantly, the transformation is reversible, without needing to store any additional data except the position of the first original character. The BWT is thus a ""free"" method of improving the efficiency of text compression algorithms, costing only some extra computation."|1

Sparta (Doric Greek: Σπάρτα, Spártā; Attic Greek: Σπάρτη, Spártē) was a prominent city-state in Laconia, in ancient Greece. In antiquity, the city-state was known as Lacedaemon , while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece.Given its military pre-eminence, Sparta was recognized as the leading force of the unified Greek military during the Greco-Persian Wars, in rivalry with the rising naval power of Athens.|1
Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour ( usually wheat ) and water , usually by mixing and kneading. Bread is made by the action of a yeast dough. In a dough made in this way, the ingredients are mixed to a dough by adding flour and water together, then the mixture is kneaded, or kneaded to make a smooth and elastic dough. The kneading helps to increase the cohesiveness and elasticity of the dough. Once it has been kneaded for a certain period of time and the dough is elastic, the dough is allowed to rise, which makes the bread rise evenly.|0

Shipway was born on the 25th May 1908, in Woking, Surrey."|0
"The raven paradox , also known as Hempel 's paradox , Hempel 's ravens , or rarely the paradox of the ravens is the paradoxical situation where a sequence of natural events that seem to happen at the same time is paradoxical. The paradox is best illustrated using a simple thought experiment. The thought experiment, which was popularized in the science fiction television series Star Trek by Gene Roddenberry, begins with a scenario:
Imagine you have just finished reading a book. As you begin reading, you realize one of the pages in your book has been torn. Your mind goes blank."|0
A shaped charge is an explosive charge shaped to focus the effect of the explosive 's energy . Different types and grades of shaped charges have evolved over the years, most notably during WWI and World War II. The shaped charges have been employed in military and civil warfare for centuries, from the time of the Romans, to the time of the Spanish Civil War. A shaped charge is considered to be 'shiny' when the entire charge does not extend to the bottom of a container or into the ground (as it does not need to be completely stable).|0

A monopropellant rocket ( or `` monochemical rocket '' ) is a rocket that uses a single chemical as its fuel and oxidizer, with the oxidizer being stored separately from the fuel. Some monopropellants are liquid oxidizer, some solid oxidizer, and others a blend of liquid and solid. The oxidizer can be a liquid, solid, or a combination thereof. The term monopropellant rocket is used in a broad sense that encompasses all monopropellant rocket systems. A liquid monopropellant rocket is one wherein the solid fuel is in a gaseous or vapor phase state at a temperature where it can vaporize.|0
In the history of cryptography , Typex ( alternatively , Type X or TypeX ) machines were British cipher machines manufactured by the British Government during World War II . The Typex machine was designed in 1942 by the British Admiralty as an advanced cipher machine to assist the Navy and the Army in the war effort . As the name of the cipher machine implies, it was primarily used to encrypt . The machine is a single-key cipher machine , which means that the only key to decrypt the code is the key used to start the code . By comparison , the Enigma machine uses an asymmetrical key system .|0
The boa knot is a modern binding knot invented by weaver Peter Collingwood in 1996 . His intention was to combine the security of a simple bowline knot with the smoothness and ease of a slipknot. The boa knot is not new, having been known for centuries. However, Collingwood's boa knot came to prominence when it appeared at the end of a successful internet marketing campaign in 1996 . It became a household term in the boating world, appearing in newspapers, on posters and in brochures. The word boa was also associated with the boa constrictor, so boa knots are known as constrictor boas or constrictor knots .|0
An adverb is a word or an expression that modifies a verb, adjective, another adverb, determiner, clause, preposition, or sentence. Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as how?, in what way?, when?, where?, and to what extent?. This is called the adverbial function, and may be performed by single words (adverbs) or by multi-word adverbial phrases and adverbial clauses.Adverbs are traditionally regarded as one of the parts of speech.|1

An inverse multiplexer (often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX) allows a data stream to be broken into multiple lower data rate communication links. An inverse multiplexer differs from a demultiplexer because the multiple output streams from the former stay inter-related, whereas those from the latter are unrelated. An inverse multiplexer is the opposite of a multiplexer  in that it divides one high-speed link into multiple low-speed links, whereas a multiplexer combines multiple low-speed links into one high-speed link.This provides an end to end connection of several times the data rate available on each of the low rate data links.|1
"Naval Submarine Base New London is the primary United States Navy East Coast submarine base, also known as the ""Home of the Submarine Force."" It is located in Groton, Connecticut directly across the Thames River from its namesake city of New London.HistoryIn 1868, the State of Connecticut gave the Navy  of land along the Thames River in Groton to build a Naval Station.

A radionuclide (radioactive nuclide, radioisotope or radioactive isotope) is a nuclide that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. This excess energy can be used in one of three ways: emitted from the nucleus as gamma radiation; transferred to one of its electrons to release it as a conversion electron; or used to create and emit a new particle (alpha particle or beta particle) from the nucleus. During those processes, the radionuclide is said to undergo radioactive decay. These emissions are considered ionizing radiation because they are powerful enough to liberate an electron from another atom.|1
"George Catlett Marshall Jr.  (December 31, 1880 – October 16, 1959) was an American army officer and statesman. He rose through the United States Army to become Chief of Staff under Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, then served as Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense under Truman. Winston Churchill lauded Marshall as the ""organizer of victory"" for his leadership of the Allied victory in World War II. After the war, he spent a frustrating year trying and failing to avoid the impending civil war in China."|1
"The Soma cube is a solid dissection puzzle invented by Danish polymath Piet Hein in 1933 during a lecture on mathematics at the Royal Physicochemical Institute. The cube was named for the Greek word soma, meaning ""brain"" or ""mind"", and was presented at the Institute as a visual aid for understanding the concept of solid geometry. Piet Hein's discovery led him to propose the four laws of solid geometry. He proposed that these laws are valid for objects of any shape; however, he did not consider his cube to be a universal solid."|0

It is one of the world's most important early Christian literature collections; it has been described as ""the mother of all early Christianity"" by one of its scholars. The text is written in Greek, the only language known to be in use in the first four centuries of Christian history. Most of the texts were written between the years 150 and 300 AD."|0
"In the philosophy of mathematics, the abstraction of actual infinity involves the acceptance (if the axiom of infinity is included) of infinite entities as given, actual and completed objects. These might include the set of natural numbers, extended real numbers, transfinite numbers, or even an infinite sequence of rational numbers. Actual infinity is to be contrasted with potential infinity, in which a non-terminating process (such as ""add 1 to the previous number"") produces a sequence with no last element, and where each individual result is finite and is achieved in a finite number of steps."|1
The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and most animals including a few fish , birds, reptiles, and amphibians. The trachea is the conducting tube and airway that connects the trachea with the bronchi and lungs. In humans, the airways are usually divided by cartilage (cartilage-lined passages), and the bronchi and bronchioles (small bronchioles) are lined with ciliated cells that function as secretory glands and release mucus into the surrounding fluid. In fishes , amphibians, and reptiles , the airways are usually lined with cartilage and lined with respiratory epithelium or respiratory epithelium and mucous cells in the respiratory lumen.|0
"A drummer is a percussionist who creates music using drums.Most contemporary western bands that play rock, pop, jazz, or R&B music include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. The drummer's equipment includes a drum kit (or ""drum set"" or ""trap set""), which includes various drums, cymbals and an assortment of accessory hardware such as pedals, standing support mechanisms, and drum sticks.Particularly in the traditional music of many countries, drummers use individual drums of various sizes and designs rather than drum kits."|1
Peperomia (radiator plant) is one of the two large genera of the family Piperaceae. Most of them are compact, small perennial epiphytes growing on rotten wood. More than 1500 species have been recorded, occurring in all tropical and subtropical regions of the world, though concentrated in Central America and northern South America. A limited number of species (around 17) are found in Africa.DescriptionThough varying considerably in appearance (see gallery below), these species generally have thick, stout stems and fleshy leaves, sometimes with epidermal windows. Peperomia flowers typically come in yellow to brown conical spikes.These tropical perennials are grown for their ornamental foliage.|1

Menstruation (also known as a period and many other colloquial terms) is the regular discharge of blood and mucosal tissue from the inner lining of the uterus through the vagina. The menstrual cycle is characterized by the rise and fall of hormones. Menstruation is triggered by falling progesterone levels and is a sign that pregnancy has not occurred.The first period, a point in time known as menarche, usually begins between the ages of 12 and 15. Menstruation starting as young as 8 years would still be considered normal. The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world, and earlier in the developed world.|1
A brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. These can be further classified as primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which most commonly have spread from tumors located outside the brain, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the size of the tumor and the part of the brain that is involved. Where symptoms exist, they may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes.|1

In chemistry , a nucleophile is a chemical species that forms bonds with electrophiles by donating an electron pair . Nucleophiles differ from electrophiles in that they generally donate only one pair of electrons, rather than two, as the acceptor. The nucleophilic substitutions, or nucleophilic displacement, is the transfer of one or more protons from one nucleophile to another, forming a nucleobase or a heterocyclic ring. In a chemical reaction, nucleophiles add an electron pair to an electron pair. The resulting nucleophilic substitution (or displacement) reactions are called nucleophilic additions.|0
"Gaelic football ( ; short name ) , commonly known as simply Gaelic , GAA or Caid , is an offshoot of Gaelic games that has existed since at least the 6th century. The word ""Gael"" means ""son of the soil"", a reference to Ireland's history as one of the most powerful kingdoms in the world. It is not known how Gaelic originated, but the language is commonly traced back to an oral tradition and a number of different languages have been used as the official language of the Gaelic Athletic Association."|0

Squid are cephalopods in the superorder Decapodiformes with elongated bodies , large eyes , eight arms and two tentacles . In other words, the largest living animal in the history of biology . You probably already know the common name squid because it has a long name. You could also call it a cuttlefish but that might be a bit too formal for a species whose scientific name is squid . For this article though, I’ll be referring to it as squid . This animal, like its relatives, is very similar in morphology to cuttlefish. However, the differences between the two are not minor.|0
Heliox is a breathing gas mixture of helium (He) and oxygen (O2).Heliox is a medical treatment for patients with difficulty breathing. The mixture generates less resistance than atmospheric air when passing through the airways of the lungs, and thus requires less effort by a patient to breathe in and out of the lungs.Heliox has been used medically since the 1930s, and although the medical community adopted it initially to alleviate symptoms of upper airway obstruction, its range of medical uses has since expanded greatly, mostly because of the low density of the gas.|1

"The word  comes from the Japanese word for logographic characters of the Chinese script, which were made a major part of the Japanese writing system along with the syllabic scripts of hiragana and katakana. More specifically, it refers to that set of Chinese characters directly incorporated into the written Japanese language with often Japanese pronunciation, inclusive of those few characters invented in Japan based on character components derived from other Chinese characters.The term kanji literally means ""Han characters"", and this word is spelled in Japanese using the same characters as traditional Chinese in reference to the character writing system, which is known as hanzi ."|1
A nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) is a type of thermal rocket where the heat from a nuclear reaction, often nuclear fission, replaces the chemical energy of the propellants in a chemical rocket. In an NTR, a working fluid, usually liquid hydrogen, is heated to a high temperature in a nuclear reactor and then expands through a rocket nozzle to create thrust. The external nuclear heat source theoretically allows a higher effective exhaust velocity and is expected to double or triple payload capacity compared to chemical propellants that store energy internally.NTRs have been proposed as a spacecraft propulsion technology, with the earliest ground tests occurring in 1955.|1
A terrarium (plural: terraria or terrariums) is usually a sealable glass container containing soil and plants, and can be opened for maintenance to access the plants inside. However, terraria can also be open to the atmosphere rather than being sealed. Terraria are often kept as decorative or ornamental items. Closed terraria create a unique environment for plant growth, as the transparent walls allow for both heat and light to enter the terrarium. The sealed container combined with the heat entering the terrarium allows for the creation of a small scale water cycle.|1

"Humour (Commonwealth English) or humor (American English) is the tendency of experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement. The term derives from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks, which taught that the balance of fluids in the human body, known as humours (Latin: humor, ""body fluid""), controlled human health and emotion.People of all ages and cultures respond to humour. Most people are able to experience humour—be amused, smile or laugh at something funny (such as a pun or joke)—and thus are considered to have a sense of humour."|1
"Twyla Tharp (; born July 1, 1941) is an American dancer, choreographer, and author who lives and works in New York City. In 1966 she formed the company Twyla Tharp Dance.

A gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of something, which must exist and is used by everyone in all countries. The United States currently uses the Gold Standard as it’s unit of account for most things. However, the gold standard has its drawbacks. For example, under a gold standard, the cost of gold fluctuates, which means that you need to buy more gold and use less. This is often referred to as a deflationary spiral because the economy is in a period of inflation, but people have less money.|0
A drought is an event of prolonged shortages in the water supply, whether atmospheric (below-average precipitation), surface water or ground water. A drought can last for months or years, or may be declared after as few as 15 days. It can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem and agriculture of the affected region and harm to the local economy. Annual dry seasons in the tropics significantly increase the chances of a drought developing and subsequent bush fires. Periods of heat can significantly worsen drought conditions by hastening evaporation of water vapour.Drought is a recurring feature of the climate in most parts of the world.|1
A museum ( ; plural museums or , rarely , musea ) is a building or institution that cares for the study of artifacts and the history of mankind through their use and display. A museum aims to display a particular culture or historical era's artworks and artifacts and is often built, maintained, or supported by government or philanthropic funding. Such funding is often made available by a private donor or a charitable foundation. In some cultures, there is a tradition of the ownership of some artifacts, while in other cultures artifacts are held in trust by private individuals.|0

Auger electron spectroscopy (AES; pronounced  in French) is a common analytical technique used specifically in the study of surfaces and, more generally, in the area of materials science. It is a form of electron spectroscopy that relies on the Auger effect, based on the analysis of energetic electrons emitted from an excited atom after a series of internal relaxation events. The Auger effect was discovered independently by both Lise Meitner and Pierre Auger in the 1920s. Though the discovery was made by Meitner and initially reported in the journal Zeitschrift für Physik in 1922, Auger is credited with the discovery in most of the scientific community.|1
In academic publishing, a scientific journal is a periodical publication intended to further the progress of science, usually by reporting new research.ContentArticles in scientific journals are mostly written by active scientists such as students, researchers and professors instead of professional journalists. There are thousands of scientific journals in publication, and many more have been published at various points in the past (see list of scientific journals). Most journals are highly specialized, although some of the oldest journals such as Nature publish articles and scientific papers across a wide range of scientific fields.|1

"The word comes from the Japanese word for logographic characters of the Chinese script , which were made a major feature of the Japanese feudal system and later spread to other countries. History

As with most Japanese words, it is difficult to reconstruct a precise origin for logographic characters. From the 14th century, there are various records of Japanese characters being used in China and Europe. This is not surprising since the Japanese language was influenced by the Chinese script , the Chinese characters and the Sanskrit language, all of which influenced the Japanese language at different times."|0

"Bi-curious is a term for a person, usually someone who is a heterosexual, who is curious or open about engaging in sexual activity with a person whose sex differs from that of their usual sexual partners. The term is sometimes used to describe a broad continuum of sexual orientation between heterosexuality and bisexuality. Such continuums include mostly-heterosexual or mostly-homosexual, but these can be self-identified without identifying as bisexual. The terms heteroflexible and homoflexible are mainly applied to bi-curious people, though some authors distinguish heteroflexibility and homoflexibility as lacking the ""wish to experiment with sexuality"" implied by the bi-curious label."|1

While a significant majority of water vessels are powered by diesel engines , with sail power and gasoline engines also becoming commercially viable alternatives to power watercraft and vessels. There are several reasons why electric propulsion is gaining importance. In terms of speed, electric engines offer the fastest acceleration, with fuel efficiency as low as that of the piston engine with similar output power. They also offer longer range for a given power, with lower maintenance costs than a gasoline engine. However, they have been shown to be more sensitive to power than piston engines at a given speed.|0

"A political prisoner is someone imprisoned for their political activity. The political offense is not always the official reason for the prisoner's detention.There is no internationally recognized legal definition of the concept, although numerous similar definitions have been proposed by various organizations and scholars, and there is a general consensus among scholars that ""individuals have been sanctioned by legal systems and imprisoned by political regimes not for their violation of codified laws but for their thoughts and ideas that have fundamentally challenged existing power relations"". The status of a political prisoner is generally awarded to individuals based on declarations of non-governmental organizations like Amnesty International, on a case-by-case basis."|1
In quantum mechanics , counterfactual definiteness ( CFD ) is the ability to speak `` meaningfully '' of the definiteness or indefiniteness of a particular physical object or property. Quantum mechanics provides an example of how to introduce CFD in an everyday context. In the following pages, we introduce this idea and explain how quantum mechanics shows how the world is made up of things that are always present, but not necessarily definite in the way they are normally thought to be. The basic idea is that objects or properties are related to their causes and are always present, but never fully defined in any particular case.|0

Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells . Cell division is one of most important processes during development, and plays an integral role in growth, development, and disease. The division of cells is a key event in the life history of an organism. During early development, cells must divide into smaller, and potentially more specialized, cells to allow the building of organs and tissues. The division of cells is also responsible for producing daughter cells that are capable of dividing to replenish the pool of cells and tissues.|0

In their most common sense , the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of consciousness , and are related to conscious states , but are not necessary or sufficient for an experience of a given kind to occur (or a consciousness of the kind). Thinking is a necessary condition of experience but not a sufficient one. To illustrate, when a conscious state occurs as part of a complex conscious experience , there are many other components that can cause that conscious state to occur, so a conscious experience must also be an integral part of some larger cognitive system.|0

"Fall back is a feature of a modem protocol in data communication whereby two communicating modems which experience data corruption (due to line noise, for example) can renegotiate with each other to use a lower-speed connection. Fall forward is a corresponding feature whereby two modems which have ""fallen back"" to a lower speed can later return to the higher speed if the connection improves.A common feature modems was the concept of fallback, allowing them to talk to less-capable modems. During the call initiation the modem would play a series of signals into the line and wait for the remote modem to ""answer"" them."|1

A hybrid-propellant rocket is a rocket with a rocket motor that uses rocket propellants in two different phases: one solid and the other either gas or liquid. The hybrid rocket concept can be traced back to at least the 1930s.Hybrid rockets avoid some of the disadvantages of solid rockets like the dangers of propellant handling, while also avoiding some disadvantages of liquid rockets like their mechanical complexity. Because it is difficult for the fuel and oxidizer to be mixed intimately (being different states of matter), hybrid rockets tend to fail more benignly than liquids or solids.|1
The overhand knot , also known as a knot and half knot , is one of the most fundamental knots in knot theory [@Fur]. There are many different kinds of overhand knots. However, we will restrict our attention in this paper to the so-called trivial overhand knot , where one of the strands that make up the overhand knot is an unknot in $S^3$. For more on overhand knots, see [@Kau1; @Kau3; @Kau2; @Kau4; @Kau5; @Kau6]. The trivial overhand knot can be constructed in $S^3$ by identifying two points of a line.|0

"Parasports are sports played by people with a disability, including physical and intellectual disabilities. Some parasports are forms of adapted physical activities from existing able-bodied sports, while others have been specifically created for persons with a disability and do not have an able-bodied equivalent. Disability exists in four categories: physical, mental, permanent and temporary. At a competitive level, disability sport classifications are applied to allow people of varying abilities to face similar opposition.EtymologyThe term ""parasports"" arose as a portmanteau of the words paraplegic and sports. Though the sport has since included athletes of disabilities other than paraplegia, the term persists as a catch-all."|1

Phenylalanine ( symbol Phe or F ) is an essential α-amino acid with the formula . It can be viewed as an aromatic amino acid, which is structurally a phenyl-substituted pyrrolidine and has important biological functions. This amino acid can be found naturally in meat, chicken, fish, and dairy products (see the table below). However, because its production is quite expensive, it must be synthesized on a large scale, which can be considered a significant economic problem (see figure below). The most commonly available source of phenylalanine is from animal tissues (see the table above).|0

In economics, inflation refers to a general progressive increase in prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. The opposite of inflation is deflation, a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualised percentage change in a general price index.Prices will not all increase at the same rates. Attaching a representative value to a set of prices is an instance of the index number problem.|1

Relative density , or specific gravity , is the ratio of the density ( mass of a unit volume ) of a material compared to the density of water at the same temperature . It is important because it indicates the percentage volume of the solid material relative to the total volume . This is useful in material science and engineering , which is why specific gravity is widely used . For example , a relative density of 1.05 indicates that the material is 95 percent water . The density of all solids and liquids is less than this value because it is not water .|0

A mass driver or electromagnetic catapult is a proposed method of non-rocket spacelaunch which would use a linear motor to accelerate and catapult payloads up to high speeds. Existing and contemplated mass drivers use coils of wire energized by electricity to make electromagnets, though a rotary mass driver has also been proposed. Sequential firing of a row of electromagnets accelerates the payload along a path. After leaving the path, the payload continues to move due to momentum.Although any device used to propel a ballistic payload is technically a mass driver, in this context a mass driver is essentially a coilgun that magnetically accelerates a package consisting of a magnetizable holder containing a payload.|1

"The fisherman 's knot is a bend ( a knot for joining two lines ) with a symmetrical structure consisting of two strands. When a straight line is made from a knot, its length and width can be determined and then it is called a straight line. In other words, this is a knot in the sense that this line has symmetrical structure and is a line that cannot be bent. The same can be applied to the fisherman's knot. ""This knot looks like a double fisherman's hitch, because it is a knot with two separate strands instead of one."|0
