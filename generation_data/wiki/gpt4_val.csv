"The Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT, also called block-sorting compression) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters. This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by techniques such as move-to-front transform and run-length encoding. More importantly, the transformation is reversible, without needing to store any additional data except the position of the first original character. The BWT is thus a ""free"" method of improving the efficiency of text compression algorithms, costing only some extra computation."|1

An inverse multiplexer ( often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX ) allows a data stream to be broken into several lower-speed streams, which are then transmitted simultaneously over multiple separate channels. The primary function of an inverse multiplexer is to enable the transmission of high-speed data over multiple low-capacity links by optimizing available bandwidth. This technique is particularly beneficial when higher-speed connections are unavailable, costly, or when several lower-capacity links need to be utilized efficiently. At the receiving end, the inverse demultiplexer recombines the lower-speed streams back into a single data stream for proper interpretation and decoding.|0

"In Euclidean geometry , an affine transformation , or an affinity ( from the Latin , affinis , `` connected with""), is a geometric transformation that maps parallel lines to parallel lines while preserving the ratios of distances between points along each line. These transformations can be combined with translation, rotation, reflection, and dilation. They are linear, in the sense that any finite combination of affine transformations produces a resultant transformation that can also be expressed as an affine transformation. In the Cartesian coordinate system, these transformations are described by a combination of a translation vector, a linear transformation matrix, and a uniform scaling factor."|0

A radionuclide (radioactive nuclide, radioisotope or radioactive isotope) is a nuclide that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. This excess energy can be used in one of three ways: emitted from the nucleus as gamma radiation; transferred to one of its electrons to release it as a conversion electron; or used to create and emit a new particle (alpha particle or beta particle) from the nucleus. During those processes, the radionuclide is said to undergo radioactive decay. These emissions are considered ionizing radiation because they are powerful enough to liberate an electron from another atom.|1

"In celestial mechanics, escape velocity or escape speed is the minimum speed needed for a free, non-propelled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a primary body, thus reaching an infinite distance from it. It is typically stated as an ideal speed, ignoring atmospheric friction. Although the term ""escape velocity"" is common, it is more accurately described as a speed than a velocity because it is independent of direction; the escape speed increases with the mass of the primary body and decreases with the distance from the primary body."|1

Jumping classes may be governed by various national horse show sanctioning organizations, such as the United States Equestrian Federation in the USA or the British Showjumping Association in Great Britain.|1
Psilocybin  is a naturally occurring psychedelic prodrug compound produced by more than 200 species of fungi. The most potent are members of the genus Psilocybe, such as P. azurescens, P. semilanceata, and P. cyanescens, but psilocybin has also been isolated from about a dozen other genera. Psilocybin is itself biologically inactive but is quickly converted by the body to psilocin, which has mind-altering effects similar, in some aspects, to those of LSD, mescaline, and DMT. In general, the effects include euphoria, visual and mental hallucinations, changes in perception, a distorted sense of time, and perceived spiritual experiences.|1
"The Novikov self-consistency principle , also known as the Novikov self-consistency conjecture and Larry Niven 's law of conservation of historicity, is a concept in theoretical physics and quantum mechanics that addresses the nature of time travel and the issues arising from potential paradoxes. This principle posits that time travelers cannot cause contradictions in their original timelines because any possible events they experience will naturally and seamlessly coalesce with established history. Essentially, Novikov's conjecture maintains that there exists an unbreakable framework for the flow of time and events, rendering attempts to create ""time loops"" or alter history ultimately futile."|0
The Soma cube is a solid dissection puzzle invented by Danish polymath Piet Hein in 1933 during a lecture on quantum mechanics conducted by Werner Heisenberg. Its name is alleged to be derived from the fictitious drug soma consumed as a pastime by the establishment in Aldous Huxley's dystopic novel Brave New World.Seven pieces made out of unit cubes must be assembled into a 3×3×3 cube. The pieces can also be used to make a variety of other 3D shapes.The pieces of the Soma cube consist of all possible combinations of three or four unit cubes, joined at their faces, such that at least one inside corner is formed.|1
"The oxidation state, or oxidation number, is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to different atoms were fully ionic. It describes the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state may be positive, negative or zero. While fully ionic bonds are not found in nature, many bonds exhibit strong ionicity, making oxidation state a useful predictor of charge.The oxidation state of an atom does not represent the ""real"" formal charge on that atom, or any other actual atomic property."|1
"""Wilhelmus van Nassouwe"", usually known just as ""Wilhelmus"" (; ; English translation: ""The William""), is the national anthem of both the Netherlands and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It dates back to at least 1572, making it the oldest national anthem in use today, provided that the latter is defined as consisting of both a melody and lyrics. Although ""Wilhelmus"" was not recognized as the official national anthem until 1932, it has always been popular with parts of the Dutch population and resurfaced on several occasions in the course of Dutch history before gaining its present status."|1
"Turandot ( , ; see below) is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini, posthumously completed by Franco Alfano in 1926, and set to a libretto in Italian by Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni. Turandot best-known aria is ""Nessun dorma"", which became globally popular in the 1990s following Luciano Pavarotti's performance of it for the 1990 FIFA World Cup.Though Puccini first became interested in the subject matter when reading Friedrich Schiller's 1801 adaptation, he based his work more closely on the earlier play Turandot (1762) by Count Carlo Gozzi."|1
A complex system is a system composed of many components which may interact with each other. Examples of complex systems are Earth's global climate, organisms, the human brain, infrastructure such as power grid, transportation or communication systems, complex software and electronic systems, social and economic organizations (like cities), an ecosystem, a living cell, and ultimately the entire universe.Complex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment.|1
"Emissions trading is a market-based approach to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives for reducing the emissions of pollutants. The concept is also known as cap and trade (CAT) or emissions trading scheme (ETS). Carbon emission trading for  and other greenhouse gases has been introduced in China, the European Union and other countries as a key tool for climate change mitigation. Other schemes include sulfur dioxide and other pollutants.In an emissions trading scheme, a central authority or governmental body allocates or sells a limited number (a ""cap"") of permits that allow a discharge of a specific quantity of a specific pollutant over a set time period."|1

The different varieties of garnets exhibit a wide range of colors, including red, green, yellow, brown, and even black, making them highly sought after for jewelry making. Besides their use as beautiful adornments, garnets have industrial applications due to their hardness and heat resistance. In this realm, they serve as important components for cutting tools, abrasive powders, and water filtration systems.|0
Emissions trading is a market-based approach to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives for reducing the emissions of pollutants . Emissions trading, also known as cap-and-trade, functions through setting a maximum limit on emissions, known as the 'cap,' and then distributing or auctioning off a set number of emission permits, called allowances. Industries and businesses that manage to reduce their emissions below their permitted limit can then sell their unused allowances to those who have exceeded their cap, creating a demand and supply dynamic. This approach not only encourages innovation in reducing emissions, but also aids businesses in staying environmentally friendly while remaining economically viable.|0
In the 1980s , the telecommunications industry expected that digital services would follow much the same pattern as voice services , and become widespread and universally accessible. This expectation was largely due to the rapid development and proliferation of new digital technologies such as fax machines, cellular phones, and eventually, the internet. Industry leaders anticipated an exponential growth in demand for digital services, with various networks supporting data transmission, internet connectivity, and real-time communications. However, this optimism was also met with certain challenges, such as managing and updating the existing analog infrastructure, and the increased competition between traditional telecommunication providers and newer digital players.|0

An ion thruster, ion drive, or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. It creates thrust by accelerating ions using electricity.An ion thruster ionizes a neutral gas by extracting some electrons out of atoms, creating a cloud of positive ions. These ion thrusters rely mainly on electrostatics as ions are accelerated by the Coulomb force along an electric field. Temporarily stored electrons are finally reinjected by a neutralizer in the cloud of ions after it has passed through the electrostatic grid, so the gas becomes neutral again and can freely disperse in space without any further electrical interaction with the thruster.|1
Alkanna tinctoria , the dyer 's alkanet or simply alkanet , is a herb in the borage family . Its main use is as a natural dye for textiles, cosmetics, and food.

Turtles are an order of reptiles known as Testudines, characterized by a shell developed mainly from their ribs. Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the side-necked turtles and hidden neck turtles which differ in the way the head retracts. There are 360 living and recently extinct species of turtles, including tortoises and terrapins. They are found on most continents, some islands and much of the ocean. Like other reptiles, birds, and mammals, they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater, although many species live in or around water.|1
"Isotope separation is the process of concentrating specific isotopes of a chemical element by removing other isotopes. The use of the nuclides produced is varied. The largest variety is used in research (e.g. in chemistry where atoms of ""marker"" nuclide are used to figure out reaction mechanisms). By tonnage, separating natural uranium into enriched uranium and depleted uranium is the largest application. In the following text, mainly the uranium enrichment is considered. This process is crucial in the manufacture of uranium fuel for nuclear power plants, and is also required for the creation of uranium-based nuclear weapons."|1

"In quantum mechanics, counterfactual definiteness (CFD) is the ability to speak ""meaningfully"" of the definiteness of the results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e., the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured). The term ""counterfactual definiteness"" is used in discussions of physics calculations, especially those related to the phenomenon called quantum entanglement and those related to the Bell inequalities. In such discussions ""meaningfully"" means the ability to treat these unmeasured results on an equal footing with measured results in statistical calculations."|1

Heliox is a breathing gas mixture of helium (He) and oxygen (O2).Heliox is a medical treatment for patients with difficulty breathing. The mixture generates less resistance than atmospheric air when passing through the airways of the lungs, and thus requires less effort by a patient to breathe in and out of the lungs.Heliox has been used medically since the 1930s, and although the medical community adopted it initially to alleviate symptoms of upper airway obstruction, its range of medical uses has since expanded greatly, mostly because of the low density of the gas.|1
"Mosquitoes are members of a group of almost 3,600 species of small flies within the family Culicidae ( from the Latin culex meaning ""gnat"" or ""midge""). These insects can be found worldwide, with the exception of a few places like Antarctica due to its extremely cold temperatures. Female mosquitoes are responsible for biting humans and animals in order to acquire nutrients from blood to help develop their eggs. Mosquitoes transmit diseases like dengue fever, West Nile virus, malaria, and Zika virus, making them one of the most deadly creatures on Earth."|0
A brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain . There are two main types of tumors : malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous).

A nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) is a type of thermal rocket where the heat from a nuclear reaction, often nuclear fission, replaces the chemical energy of the propellants in a chemical rocket. In an NTR, a working fluid, usually liquid hydrogen, is heated to a high temperature in a nuclear reactor and then expands through a rocket nozzle to create thrust. The external nuclear heat source theoretically allows a higher effective exhaust velocity and is expected to double or triple payload capacity compared to chemical propellants that store energy internally.NTRs have been proposed as a spacecraft propulsion technology, with the earliest ground tests occurring in 1955.|1

Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton 's third law . When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction, an equal and opposite force is exerted on that system, resulting in thrust. This principle is exemplified by propulsion systems such as jet engines, rocket engines, or even a simple propeller. The expelled mass can be a fuel, such as in chemical rockets or compressed gas, such as in air-powered thrusters. Alternatively, an external mass can be accelerated, such as water or air, to create thrust in propulsion systems like ship propellers or airplane jet engines.|0
In commutative algebra , the prime spectrum ( or simply the spectrum ) of a ring R is the set of all prime ideals of R, denoted as Spec(R).

"Fermat's principle, also known as the principle of least time, is the link between ray optics and wave optics. In its original ""strong"" form, Fermat's principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time. In order to be true in all cases, this statement must be weakened by replacing the ""least"" time with a time that is ""stationary"" with respect to variations of the path — so that a deviation in the path causes, at most, a second-order change in the traversal time."|1
Thermonuclear fusion is the process of atoms combining or “ fusing ” together with huge amounts of heat .

Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents.

Magma is the molten or semi-molten natural material from which all igneous rocks are formed . Magma is found beneath the Earth's surface, primarily in the upper mantle and lower crust, where temperatures are high enough to cause rock to melt. When magma is pushed or forced to the Earth's surface, it can cause a volcanic eruption. During these eruptions, magma (also referred to as lava when outside of the earth's crust) cools down, hardens, and becomes igneous rock. Intrusive igneous rocks, like granite, are formed below the surface while extrusive igneous rocks, like basalt, are created above it.|0

Their dietary preferences include insects, worms, and even smaller frogs.|0
"Bi-curious is a term for a person, usually someone who is a heterosexual, who is curious or open about engaging in sexual activity with a person whose sex differs from that of their usual sexual partners. The term is sometimes used to describe a broad continuum of sexual orientation between heterosexuality and bisexuality. Such continuums include mostly-heterosexual or mostly-homosexual, but these can be self-identified without identifying as bisexual. The terms heteroflexible and homoflexible are mainly applied to bi-curious people, though some authors distinguish heteroflexibility and homoflexibility as lacking the ""wish to experiment with sexuality"" implied by the bi-curious label."|1

"Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare . Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the history of England, they were classified as ""histories"" in the First Folio. Shakespeare's tragedies typically exhibit a hero who is faced with a significant and eventually tragic personal challenge that they must overcome, often causing great suffering for themselves and those around them. These heroes tend to be royal figures, characterized by their extraordinary charisma and intelligence, qualities that set them apart from others."|0

In economics, inflation refers to a general progressive increase in prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. The opposite of inflation is deflation, a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualised percentage change in a general price index.Prices will not all increase at the same rates. Attaching a representative value to a set of prices is an instance of the index number problem.|1

In quantum mechanics , counterfactual definiteness ( CFD ) is the ability to speak `` meaningfully '' of the definiteness of the outcomes of measurements that have not been performed. It suggests that well-defined values of observables exist for quantum systems even if no measurement is made. CFD arises from the assumption of a hidden-variable theory, which states that the values of these unmeasured observables have precise and objective existence independent of observation. However, counterfactual definiteness challenges the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, which postulates the wave function's collapse upon measurement and holds that physical properties do not have precise values until measured.|0
"Anthony John Hancock (12 May 1924 – 25 June 1968) was an English comedian and actor.High-profile during the 1950s and early 1960s, he had a major success with his BBC series Hancock's Half Hour, first broadcast on radio from 1954, then on television from 1956, in which he soon formed a strong professional and personal bond with comic actor Sid James. Although Hancock's decision to cease working with James, when it became known in early 1960, disappointed many at the time, his last BBC series in 1961 contains some of his best-remembered work (including ""The Blood Donor"" and ""The Radio Ham"")."|1
The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. It  concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.The conjecture is named after mathematician Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate.|1
In their most common sense , the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of external stimuli or situations. Thought encompasses a range of mental activities such as problem-solving, reasoning, understanding, perceiving, evaluating, remembering, and planning.
