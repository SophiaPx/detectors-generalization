Optical rotation, also known as polarization rotation or circular birefringence, is the rotation of the orientation of the plane of polarization about the optical axis of linearly polarized light as it travels through certain materials. Circular birefringence and circular dichroism are the manifestations of optical activity. Optical activity occurs only in chiral materials, those lacking microscopic mirror symmetry. Unlike other sources of birefringence which alter a beam's state of polarization, optical activity can be observed in fluids. This can include gases or solutions of chiral molecules such as sugars, molecules with helical secondary structure such as some proteins, and also chiral liquid crystals.|1

Observations show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy recedes from the observer is continuously increasing with time.The accelerated expansion was discovered during 1998, by two independent projects, the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-Z Supernova Search Team, which both used distant type Ia supernovae to measure the acceleration. The idea was that as type Ia supernovae have almost the same intrinsic brightness (a standard candle), and since objects that are further away appear dimmer, we can use the observed brightness of these supernovae to measure the distance to them.|1

In mathematics , open sets are a generalization of open intervals in the real line . In a metric space—that is, an interval that takes an integer and returns either zero or positive values—it is necessary for the calculation of the integral between the first two values. A common misconception about logarithmic systems is that only one variable can be specified at any time; this may be due to many different computations performed on the data. An example is set_sigma , which specifies what happens when a constant is chosen from a list of arbitrarily long values.|0

Bdellovibrio is a genus of Gram-negative , obligate aerobic bacterium . One of the more notable characteristics of this genus is its ability to live in a wide range of environment, from deserts to freshwater. It is also responsible for a wide range of bacterial infections, including Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal adenomas (GCAA). However, many bacteria have not been able to survive in open soil conditions because of their resistance to sunlight. This limited ability has led several pathogens to be difficult to eradicate without intensive control efforts such as herbicide use, fertilization, and antibiotics.|0

Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism, though usually most classify up to homotopy equivalence.Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems, using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible. Algebraic topology, for example, allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a free group is again a free group.Main branches of algebraic topologyBelow are some of the main areas studied in algebraic topology:Homotopy groupsIn mathematics, homotopy groups are used in algebraic topology to classify topological spaces.|1

Vapor pressure (or vapour pressure in English-speaking counties other than the US; see spelling differences) or equilibrium vapor pressure is defined as the pressure exerted by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases (solid or liquid) at a given temperature in a closed system.

Observations show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy, in turn, is expanding . As observed from the early history of the universe, stars are highly unstable and sometimes collapse under gravity. However, if the star has a stable mass, there is no gravitational force capable of breaking it apart. The structure of stars also makes them relatively stable, though some smaller stars can form dense structures with more mass. In many ways, neutron stars are the earliest stars on earth, making them less likely to collapse than their nearest closest relatives.|0

Tesla experimented with a number of different configurations consisting of two, or sometimes three, coupled resonant electric circuits.Tesla used these circuits to conduct innovative experiments in electrical lighting, phosphorescence, X-ray generation, high frequency alternating current phenomena, electrotherapy, and the transmission of electrical energy without wires. Tesla coil circuits were used commercially in sparkgap radio transmitters for wireless telegraphy until the 1920s, and in medical equipment such as electrotherapy and violet ray devices.|1

Natural science is one of the branches of science concerned with the description, understanding and prediction of natural phenomena, based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation. Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.Natural science can be divided into two main branches: life science and physical science. Life science is alternatively known as biology, and physical science is subdivided into branches: physics, chemistry, earth science, and astronomy. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields).|1

In cosmology, the cosmological constant (usually denoted by the Greek capital letter lambda: Λ), alternatively called Einstein's cosmological constant, is the constant coefficient of a term Albert Einstein temporarily added to his field equations of general relativity. He later removed it. Much later it was revived and reinterpreted as the energy density of space, or vacuum energy, that arises in quantum mechanics. It is closely associated with the concept of dark energy.Einstein originally introduced the constant in 1917 to counterbalance the effect of gravity and achieve a static universe, a notion which was the accepted view at the time.|1
Photomontage is the process and the result of making a composite photograph by cutting , gluing , rearranging and overlapping sections with a lens (photoshop) in a way to create an enlarged image. This technique is one of the methods used in modern film making, although it does not take into account such fine-grained details as color balance. It is commonly used for small-sized digital prints, and can therefore be regarded as a prime example of digitally composited photos.In addition to processing, photomontage makes up about 50% of the total cost of film making.|0

"Proline (symbol Pro or P) is an organic acid classed as a proteinogenic amino acid (used in the biosynthesis of proteins), although it does not contain the amino group  but is rather a secondary amine. The secondary amine nitrogen is in the protonated NH2+ form under biological conditions, while the carboxyl group is in the deprotonated −COO− form. The ""side chain"" from the α carbon connects to the nitrogen forming a pyrrolidine loop, classifying it as a aliphatic amino acid.

In mathematics, two sets are said to be disjoint sets if they have no element in common. Equivalently, two disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is the empty set. For example, {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are disjoint sets, while {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5} are not disjoint. A collection of more than two sets is called disjoint if any two distinct sets of the collection are disjoint.GeneralizationsThis definition of disjoint sets can be extended to a family of sets : the family is pairwise disjoint, or mutually disjoint if  whenever .|1
