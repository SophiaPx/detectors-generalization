Such continuums include mostly-heterosexual or mostly-homosexual, but these can be self-identified without identifying as bisexual. The terms heteroflexible and homoflexible are mainly applied to bi-curious people, though some authors distinguish heteroflexibility and homoflexibility as lacking the ""wish to experiment with sexuality"" implied by the bi-curious label."|1

The raven paradox , also known as Hempel 's paradox , Hempel 's ravens , or rarely the paradox of the raven, is a recent philosophical argument in philosophy about how we can explain the origin and history of life on planet earth. In its simplest meaning, the paradox argues that if the cosmos was formed before the universe itself began to exist, it has no purpose and is merely an artifact of our present-day existence. If the universe were created at some earlier time, then its cause would likely be obvious, and it would have no intrinsic purpose.|0

"Relative density, or specific gravity, is the ratio of the density (mass of a unit volume) of a substance to the density of a given reference material. Specific gravity for liquids is nearly always measured with respect to water at its densest (at ); for gases, the reference is air at room temperature . The term ""relative density"" is often preferred in scientific usage. If a substance's relative density is less than 1 then it is less dense than the reference; if greater than 1 then it is denser than the reference."|1

An ion thruster, ion drive, or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. It creates thrust by accelerating ions using electricity.An ion thruster ionizes a neutral gas by extracting some electrons out of atoms, creating a cloud of positive ions. These ion thrusters rely mainly on electrostatics as ions are accelerated by the Coulomb force along an electric field. Temporarily stored electrons are finally reinjected by a neutralizer in the cloud of ions after it has passed through the electrostatic grid, so the gas becomes neutral again and can freely disperse in space without any further electrical interaction with the thruster.|1

The largest variety is used in research (e.g. in chemistry where atoms of ""marker"" nuclide are used to figure out reaction mechanisms). By tonnage, separating natural uranium into enriched uranium and depleted uranium is the largest application. In the following text, mainly the uranium enrichment is considered. This process is crucial in the manufacture of uranium fuel for nuclear power plants, and is also required for the creation of uranium-based nuclear weapons."|1
"The subset sum problem ( SSP ) is a decision problem in computer science .

The wind tunnel moves air around an object, making it seem as if the object is flying.Most of the time, large powerful fans suck air through the tube.|1
In chemistry, a nucleophile is a chemical species that forms bonds with electrophiles by donating an electron pair. All molecules and ions with a free pair of electrons or at least one pi bond can act as nucleophiles. Because nucleophiles donate electrons, they are Lewis bases. Nucleophilic describes the affinity of a nucleophile to bond with positively charged atomic nuclei. Nucleophilicity, sometimes referred to as nucleophile strength, refers to a substance's nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the affinity of atoms. Neutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohols and water are named solvolysis.|1

A hybrid-propellant rocket is a rocket with a rocket motor that uses rocket propellants in two different phases: one solid and the other either gas or liquid. The hybrid rocket concept can be traced back to at least the 1930s.Hybrid rockets avoid some of the disadvantages of solid rockets like the dangers of propellant handling, while also avoiding some disadvantages of liquid rockets like their mechanical complexity. Because it is difficult for the fuel and oxidizer to be mixed intimately (being different states of matter), hybrid rockets tend to fail more benignly than liquids or solids.|1
Year 976 ( CMLXXVI ) was a leap year starting on Saturday ( link will display the full calendar ) in 1847.

Luge is also the name of an Olympic sport.Lugers can reach speeds of 140 km/h (87 mph). Austrian Manuel Pfister reached a top speed of 154 km/h (96 mph) on a track in Whistler, Canada, prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics.|1
"In celestial mechanics, escape velocity or escape speed is the minimum speed needed for a free, non-propelled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a primary body, thus reaching an infinite distance from it. It is typically stated as an ideal speed, ignoring atmospheric friction. Although the term ""escape velocity"" is common, it is more accurately described as a speed than a velocity because it is independent of direction; the escape speed increases with the mass of the primary body and decreases with the distance from the primary body."|1

In economics, inflation refers to a general progressive increase in prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. The opposite of inflation is deflation, a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualised percentage change in a general price index.Prices will not all increase at the same rates. Attaching a representative value to a set of prices is an instance of the index number problem.|1

"A political prisoner is someone imprisoned for their political activity. The political offense is not always the official reason for the prisoner's detention.There is no internationally recognized legal definition of the concept, although numerous similar definitions have been proposed by various organizations and scholars, and there is a general consensus among scholars that ""individuals have been sanctioned by legal systems and imprisoned by political regimes not for their violation of codified laws but for their thoughts and ideas that have fundamentally challenged existing power relations"". The status of a political prisoner is generally awarded to individuals based on declarations of non-governmental organizations like Amnesty International, on a case-by-case basis."|1

Etruscan civilization endured until it was assimilated into Roman society.|1
"In quantum mechanics, counterfactual definiteness (CFD) is the ability to speak ""meaningfully"" of the definiteness of the results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e., the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured). The term ""counterfactual definiteness"" is used in discussions of physics calculations, especially those related to the phenomenon called quantum entanglement and those related to the Bell inequalities. In such discussions ""meaningfully"" means the ability to treat these unmeasured results on an equal footing with measured results in statistical calculations."|1
Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents. Legal adoptions permanently transfer all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parents to the adoptive parents.Unlike guardianship or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption, while others used less formal means (notably contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of filiation).|1

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed (or re-entrant); otherwise, it is open.The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour. Creating a program to find a knight's tour is a common problem given to computer science students.|1
Adenine ( symbol A or Ade ) is a nucleobase ( a purine derivative ) . It is one of the most abundant proteins in the genome, constituting approximately 97.5% of the total mRNA and 96.8% of protein content of all living cells; its abundance is believed to have been increased by the appearance of RNA as the first step in genetic coding. As such, it represents a crucial source of gene regulation during embryonic development, and has been shown to regulate several important aspects of cell functions including cellular metabolism, proliferation, maintenance, differentiation, and apoptosis.|0

An inverse multiplexer (often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX) allows a data stream to be broken into multiple lower data rate communication links. An inverse multiplexer differs from a demultiplexer because the multiple output streams from the former stay inter-related, whereas those from the latter are unrelated. An inverse multiplexer is the opposite of a multiplexer  in that it divides one high-speed link into multiple low-speed links, whereas a multiplexer combines multiple low-speed links into one high-speed link.This provides an end to end connection of several times the data rate available on each of the low rate data links.|1

"Dekker 's algorithm is the first known correct solution to the mutual exclusion problem in concurrent programming . The solution of the problem involves two steps. First, the program computes a sequence of numbers called the ""probability tree"" that points from the starting position to the end of the sequence, and then determines if there are at least two alternatives that lie beyond the next option. If there are two such alternatives, the program tries to find the largest possible order in the set. In this way, the probability tree gives the true order."|0

A mass driver or electromagnetic catapult is a proposed method of non-rocket spacelaunch which would use a linear motor to accelerate and catapult payloads up to high speeds. Existing and contemplated mass drivers use coils of wire energized by electricity to make electromagnets, though a rotary mass driver has also been proposed. Sequential firing of a row of electromagnets accelerates the payload along a path. After leaving the path, the payload continues to move due to momentum.Although any device used to propel a ballistic payload is technically a mass driver, in this context a mass driver is essentially a coilgun that magnetically accelerates a package consisting of a magnetizable holder containing a payload.|1
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR ) is a method for allocating IP addresses and for IP routing. The Internet Engineering Task Force introduced CIDR in 1993 to replace the previous classful network addressing architecture on the Internet. Its goal was to slow the growth of routing tables on routers across the Internet, and to help slow the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.IP addresses are described as consisting of two groups of bits in the address: the most significant bits are the network prefix, which identifies a whole network or subnet, and the least significant set forms the host identifier, which specifies a particular interface of a host on that network.|1
An intranet is a computer network for sharing information , easier communication , collaboration tools , operational systems , and communications. In the early 1960s, the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School's Department of Computer Science started to experiment with a machine-learning program called Matlab.

A software bug is an error , flaw or fault in computer software that causes it to produce an incorrect output. Bugs cause errors to appear when a program performs some operation that does not work as expected. It can also cause other programs to crash at the exact same time because of the mistake.Computer systems (and, in particular, operating systems and software) do not always follow a set of rules about what is permitted and what is not on their systems. This is especially true of applications written for the most part by third parties, who often modify their own code to handle different operating systems and hardware.|0
"In mathematics , the Dirac delta distribution ( distribution ) , also known as the unit impulse symbol , is a mathematical function describing the change in velocity of an object over time with respect to a stationary line.The equation is defined as:
The Dirac delta formula is commonly used to quantify changes in velocity due to a gravitational force. It can be used to make measurements on surfaces such as ice crystals, particles and other fluids, which are subject to a large degree of friction during cold weather conditions. Its importance lies in its ability to measure changes in velocity without using additional equipment."|0

"A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura (literally without tail in Ancient Greek). The oldest fossil ""proto-frog"" Triadobatrachus is known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their split from other amphibians may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforest. Frogs account for around 88% of extant amphibian species."|1

Theories of political behavior , as an aspect of political science , attempt to quantify and explain the influences that political actors' actions have on society at large. While there are many legitimate theories regarding political behavior, no single theory has come to dominate the academic literature for more than a few decades.In this paper, we argue that the role of politics in social change is complex, with different aspects being important and mutually antagonistic. Specifically, we find that the effects of politics on society are mediated by two different modes of action: (1) collective action and (2) individual self-determination.|0
In philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own, properties or behaviors which emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole.Emergence plays a central role in theories of integrative levels and of complex systems. For instance, the phenomenon of life as studied in biology is an emergent property of chemistry, and many psychological phenomena are known to emerge from underlying neurobiological processes.In philosophy, theories that emphasize emergent properties have been called emergentism.In philosophyPhilosophers often understand emergence as a claim about the etiology of a system's properties.|1

Soil is a mixture of organic matter , minerals , gases , liquids , and organisms that together support life as we know it, including plants and animals. It's a common element in soils because it makes up 85 percent of the soil's overall mass, while only 5 percent of plant material is organic (compared to 20 percent for all other organic materials). Hemoglobin is a protein secreted from the red blood cells that carries oxygen within the blood stream. It contains three hydrogen bonds with a single nitrogen bond, which allows oxygen molecules to pass readily through its membrane and be absorbed by the red blood cells.|0
The striatum, or corpus striatum (also called the striate nucleus), is a nucleus (a cluster of neurons) in the subcortical basal ganglia of the forebrain. The striatum is a critical component of the motor and reward systems; receives glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs from different sources; and serves as the primary input to the rest of the basal ganglia.Functionally, the striatum coordinates multiple aspects of cognition, including both motor and action planning, decision-making, motivation, reinforcement, and reward perception. The striatum is made up of the caudate nucleus and the lentiform nucleus.|1
"The Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT, also called block-sorting compression) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters. This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by techniques such as move-to-front transform and run-length encoding. More importantly, the transformation is reversible, without needing to store any additional data except the position of the first original character. The BWT is thus a ""free"" method of improving the efficiency of text compression algorithms, costing only some extra computation."|1
"Plotinus ( ; , Plōtînos ; – 270 CE ) was a philosopher in the Hellenistic tradition , born and educated at Corinth.

A radionuclide (radioactive nuclide, radioisotope or radioactive isotope) is a nuclide that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. This excess energy can be used in one of three ways: emitted from the nucleus as gamma radiation; transferred to one of its electrons to release it as a conversion electron; or used to create and emit a new particle (alpha particle or beta particle) from the nucleus. During those processes, the radionuclide is said to undergo radioactive decay. These emissions are considered ionizing radiation because they are powerful enough to liberate an electron from another atom.|1
Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish . Fish are often caught in the wild but may also be caught by trawling or trawling equipment operated by professional fishermen. In the United States there are approximately 3,000 species and over 25,000 known habitats. Fisheries have been around for centuries and vary in size and complexity depending on the region they are found in.Most fishing operations are small family-owned companies, which can operate from a number of locations throughout the U.S. These organizations are known as commercial fishermen. There are dozens of registered fisheries in the United States, some of which are federally regulated such as the Maryland Aquarium System.|0

Dekker's algorithm is the first known correct solution to the mutual exclusion problem in concurrent programming. The solution is attributed to Dutch mathematician Th. J. Dekker by Edsger W. Dijkstra in an unpublished paper on sequential process descriptions and his manuscript on cooperating sequential processes. It allows two threads to share a single-use resource without conflict, using only shared memory for communication.It avoids the strict alternation of a naïve turn-taking algorithm, and was one of the first mutual exclusion algorithms to be invented.OverviewIf two processes attempt to enter a critical section at the same time, the algorithm will allow only one process in, based on whose turn it is.|1
A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied , tailless amphibians composing the order Echinoderms (also spelled Echinodermaceae) of the order Carcharhiniformes.They live in rain forests, wetlands, coastal areas, estuaries, river systems, and freshwater lakes throughout the world. They are one of the few marine vertebrates to lack an ichthyosaurian skull.Frogs have been studied by many groups over time, but the most recent major work was published in 1984 by Robert W.

"Parasports are sports played by people with a disability, including physical and intellectual disabilities. Some parasports are forms of adapted physical activities from existing able-bodied sports, while others have been specifically created for persons with a disability and do not have an able-bodied equivalent. Disability exists in four categories: physical, mental, permanent and temporary. At a competitive level, disability sport classifications are applied to allow people of varying abilities to face similar opposition.EtymologyThe term ""parasports"" arose as a portmanteau of the words paraplegic and sports. Though the sport has since included athletes of disabilities other than paraplegia, the term persists as a catch-all."|1
In the 1980s , the telecommunications industry expected that digital services would follow much the same pattern as voice services, but with a few significant differences. The largest difference was that the transmission of video signals would use analog-based cable networks instead of the digital fiber optic networks used by voice communications today. The history of computer science and programming (in general) is a fascinating topic for many reasons; one of the most prominent among these is that we have only just began to learn about the techniques of programming computers from scratch.|0

A seed is an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering . The formation of the seed is part of the process by which plants can survive in harsh climates, such as in dry forests or desert environments. Seeds may be formed by a variety of mechanisms, depending on the nature of the soil, environment and climatic conditions during the growing season.The most commonly used methods include germinating, vegetatively propagating, pollen-forming and transgenic (tolerant to gene transfer). In both cases, the mother plants carry the seeds out of their bodies and into a special area of the plant that they have colonised.|0
"In philosophy , systems theory , science , and art , emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have been created by natural events. An entity that emerges from a process of random generation is called a ""transitional being"": it does not necessarily appear in the form of an actual existing thing, but rather as a new-looking entity that appears randomly in its place (for example, a butterfly).There is no single formal definition for emergence, although some early ideas suggest that emerging entities are merely the result of chance or random selection."|0

"The oxidation state, or oxidation number, is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to different atoms were fully ionic. It describes the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state may be positive, negative or zero. While fully ionic bonds are not found in nature, many bonds exhibit strong ionicity, making oxidation state a useful predictor of charge.The oxidation state of an atom does not represent the ""real"" formal charge on that atom, or any other actual atomic property."|1

They are formed by decomposing organic materials, such as wood and charcoal, with carbon monoxide ( CO ) or oxygen (O 2 ), producing gases of various sizes.|0
"In the philosophy of mathematics, the abstraction of actual infinity involves the acceptance (if the axiom of infinity is included) of infinite entities as given, actual and completed objects. These might include the set of natural numbers, extended real numbers, transfinite numbers, or even an infinite sequence of rational numbers. Actual infinity is to be contrasted with potential infinity, in which a non-terminating process (such as ""add 1 to the previous number"") produces a sequence with no last element, and where each individual result is finite and is achieved in a finite number of steps."|1

A gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed rate of exchange. Its name comes from the fact that gold or other precious metals are not accepted as legal tender.The most widely accepted form of money in history was the copper standard. During the mid-twentieth century, it replaced gold as the currency of central banking and was adopted by many European countries. However, due to its unstable nature and high inflation rate (due to over-centralization), it remained largely out of favor until the financial crisis of 2008.|0
"A resistojet is a method of spacecraft propulsion ( electric propulsion ) that provides thrust by heating a , typically at sub-orbital speeds. In the context of space travel, its applications lie mostly in propellant-driven rocket and capsule flight, but some other applications are also apparent, such as atmospheric entry, hypergolic flow, low-speed interstellar transport, and hypersonic flight.The name ""resistojet"" is given to this technology by Russian astronomer Mikhail Korolev after he discovered the effect in 1897 on his observatory's optical telescope. This discovery was important because it revealed the role of infrared light in the propagation of objects beyond the visible wavelengths."|0
A supercomputer is a computer with a high level of performance as compared to a general-purpose computer . The performance of an artificial intelligence system can be directly compared to a typical human, but in practice the performance of any system has a direct relationship to the power and efficiency at which it was developed by humans.

The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. It  concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.The conjecture is named after mathematician Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate.|1
