A conjugate acid , within the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory , is a chemical compound formed when an acid donates a hydrogen cation, or proton (usually H+) to a weakly basic compound that contains a hydroxide group. For example, HCl is a conjugate acid. Because of conjugation, hydrogen ions can be removed from the acid by forming a conjugate acid, and replaced by an electronegative counter-ion. In particular, the conjugate anions of the conjugate bases of strong acids are the conjugate bases of weak acids, because strong acids are relatively unreactive.|0

Observations show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy is moving increases as the distance to it decreases. In other words, there is no recession, and this acceleration means that the distance to galaxies is increasing. This is in contradiction with the idea of a finite universe, and so the cause of cosmic acceleration has remained elusive. A simple explanation for this is in Einstein’s cosmological constant, but this has been ruled out by astronomical observations . A new approach to the problem is offered by an idea of quantum entanglement .|0

Nature deals with the biological inheritance of an organism, which is the product of the genes within the germ cells of the parents, while Nurture is the environmental experience that shapes the individual throughout life. Many researchers agree that nature plays a greater role in shaping an individual and that nurture plays a less important role. The debate is complicated by the idea that both nature and nurture have significant effects on each other: an individual's environment is influenced by his biology.|0

Optical rotation, also known as polarization rotation or circular birefringence, is the rotation of the orientation of the plane of polarization about the optical axis of linearly polarized light as it travels through certain materials. Circular birefringence and circular dichroism are the manifestations of optical activity. Optical activity occurs only in chiral materials, those lacking microscopic mirror symmetry. Unlike other sources of birefringence which alter a beam's state of polarization, optical activity can be observed in fluids. This can include gases or solutions of chiral molecules such as sugars, molecules with helical secondary structure such as some proteins, and also chiral liquid crystals.|1

Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism, though usually most classify up to homotopy equivalence.Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems, using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible. Algebraic topology, for example, allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a free group is again a free group.Main branches of algebraic topologyBelow are some of the main areas studied in algebraic topology:Homotopy groupsIn mathematics, homotopy groups are used in algebraic topology to classify topological spaces.|1

A conjugate acid, within the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, is a  chemical compound formed when an acid donates a proton (H+) to a base—in other words, it is a base with a hydrogen ion added to it, as in the reverse reaction it loses a hydrogen ion. On the other hand, a conjugate base is what is left over after an acid has donated a proton during a chemical reaction. Hence, a conjugate base is a species formed by the removal of a proton from an acid, as in the reverse reaction it is able to gain a hydrogen ion.|1

In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the abstract notion of a limit captures the essential properties of universal constructions such as products, pullbacks and inverse limits. The dual notion of a colimit generalizes constructions such as disjoint unions, direct sums, coproducts, pushouts and direct limits.Limits and colimits, like the strongly related notions of universal properties and adjoint functors, exist at a high level of abstraction. In order to understand them, it is helpful to first study the specific examples these concepts are meant to generalize.Definition Limits and colimits in a category  are defined by means of diagrams in .|1

In mathematics, two sets are said to be disjoint sets if they have no element in common. Equivalently, two disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is the empty set. For example, {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are disjoint sets, while {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5} are not disjoint. A collection of more than two sets is called disjoint if any two distinct sets of the collection are disjoint.GeneralizationsThis definition of disjoint sets can be extended to a family of sets : the family is pairwise disjoint, or mutually disjoint if  whenever .|1

Digital electronics is a field of electronics involving the study of digital signals and the engineering of devices that use digital electronic components and systems to create, manipulate and process the signals. The field includes both digital electronics and computing, where the distinction between the two is often blurred. Much of the history of computing and digital electronics has been intertwined with that of telecommunications, the military and aerospace, as well as other domains. This is true for much of the 20th and 21st centuries. Digital electronics is sometimes referred to as information technology, as information is central to much of modern electronics.|0
In mathematics, open sets are a generalization of  open intervals in the real line. In a metric space—that is, when a distance function is defined—open sets are the sets that, with every point , contain all points that are sufficiently near to  (that is, all points whose distance to  is less than some value depending on ).More generally, one defines open sets as the members of a given collection of subsets of a given set, a collection that has the property of containing every union of its members, every finite intersection of its members, the empty set, and the whole set itself.|1
In cosmology , the cosmological constant ( usually denoted by the Greek capital letter lambda : Λ ) , alternatively called dark energy, is the largest possible positive constant in the Einstein field equations . It is a form of energy that is responsible for the accelerating expansion of the present-day Universe . The nature of this dark energy, however, remains one of the central unsolved problems in theoretical physics . Dark energy, also sometimes referred to as simply the vacuum energy ( or the energy of the vacuum ) or simply the cosmological constant , was introduced by Albert Einstein in his Field Equations of General Relativity in 1917 .|0

Electroporation, or electropermeabilization, is a microbiology technique in which an electrical field is applied to cells in order to increase the permeability of the cell membrane, allowing chemicals, drugs, electrode arrays or DNA to be introduced into the cell (also called electrotransfer). In microbiology, the process of electroporation is often used to transform bacteria, yeast, or plant protoplasts by introducing new coding DNA. If bacteria and plasmids are mixed together, the plasmids can be transferred into the bacteria after electroporation, though depending on what is being transferred, cell-penetrating peptides or CellSqueeze could also be used.|1
A trisomy is a type of polysomy in which there are three instances of a particular chromosome, instead of the normal two.

Gravity , or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy, including planets, stars, galaxies and even light, are attracted to (or gravitate toward) one another. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity causes the tides of the oceans. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing and forming stars and caused the stars to group together into galaxies, so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the Universe.|1

In computational complexity theory , PSPACE is the set of all decision problems that can be solved by a Turing machine using a stack that grows only finitely often , which is to say that the machine can only use the stack for a bounded number of steps, and then the stack is allowed to shrink in some controlled way. Thus, the computational complexity of many mathematical problems can be specified in terms of their time complexity , which is the number of steps required to compute a solution by a Turing machine, and not the time required to compute a solution by physical means.|0
