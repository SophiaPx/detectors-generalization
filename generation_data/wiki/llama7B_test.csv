Nature versus nurture is a long-standing debate in biology about the balance between two competing factors which determine fate : our genes (nature) versus the external environment (nurture).

Optical rotation, also known as polarization rotation or circular birefringence, is the rotation of the orientation of the plane of polarization about the optical axis of linearly polarized light as it travels through certain materials. Circular birefringence and circular dichroism are the manifestations of optical activity. Optical activity occurs only in chiral materials, those lacking microscopic mirror symmetry. Unlike other sources of birefringence which alter a beam's state of polarization, optical activity can be observed in fluids. This can include gases or solutions of chiral molecules such as sugars, molecules with helical secondary structure such as some proteins, and also chiral liquid crystals.|1

In mathematics, two sets are said to be disjoint sets if they have no element in common. Equivalently, two disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is the empty set. For example, {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are disjoint sets, while {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5} are not disjoint. A collection of more than two sets is called disjoint if any two distinct sets of the collection are disjoint.GeneralizationsThis definition of disjoint sets can be extended to a family of sets : the family is pairwise disjoint, or mutually disjoint if  whenever .|1

Tone is the use of pitch in language to distinguish lexical or grammatical meaning – that is, to distinguish or to inflect words. All verbal languages use pitch to express emotional and other paralinguistic information and to convey emphasis, contrast and other such features in what is called intonation, but not all languages use tones to distinguish words or their inflections, analogously to consonants and vowels. Languages that have this feature are called tonal languages; the distinctive tone patterns of such a language are sometimes called tonemes, by analogy with phoneme.|1

Bdellovibrio is a genus of Gram-negative , obligate aerobic bacterium . One of the more notable characteristics of this genus is its ability to inject a cytotoxin into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic organisms such as humans, in order to replicate their DNA, which is often in the form of naked circles. In fact, the only known way that it can reproduce is by inserting its DNA into the host cell in order to replicate the plasmid (circular, double-stranded DNA). It is believed that it was originally an endospore-forming bacterium, and when it enters an eukaryotic cell it converts back to a spiral bacterium.|0
Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism, though usually most classify up to homotopy equivalence.Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems, using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible. Algebraic topology, for example, allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a free group is again a free group.Main branches of algebraic topologyBelow are some of the main areas studied in algebraic topology:Homotopy groupsIn mathematics, homotopy groups are used in algebraic topology to classify topological spaces.|1
In computational complexity theory , PSPACE is the set of all decision problems that can be solved by a Turing machine in logarithmic space, typically defined as the set of all decision problems that have a polynomial-size answer. It is also a subset of the class of languages that are efficiently solvable on a Turing machine in exponential space , also called PTIME . A function f : 0-1-to-N is polynomially tractable if there exists another function g that satisfies. The PSPACE completeness conjecture is the statement that the set of logically complete problems is closed under PSPACE reductions, where a polynomial-time many-one reduction is called a PSPACE-complete problem.|0

"Spins are an element in figure skating in which the skater rotates, centered on a single point on the ice, while holding one or more body positions. They are performed by all disciplines of the sport, single skating, pair skating, and ice dance, and are a required element in most figure skating competitions. As The New York Times says, ""While jumps look like sport, spins look more like art. While jumps provide the suspense, spins provide the scenery, but there is so much more to the scenery than most viewers have time or means to grasp""."|1

A trisomy is a type of polysomy in which there are three instances of a particular chromosome, instead of the normal two. A trisomy is a type of aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes).Description and causesMost organisms that reproduce sexually have pairs of chromosomes in each cell, with one chromosome inherited from each parent. In such organisms, a process called meiosis creates cells called gametes (eggs or sperm) that have only one set of chromosomes. The number of chromosomes is different for different species. Humans have 46 chromosomes (i.e. 23 pairs of chromosomes).|1

In physics , optical depth or optical thickness is the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant power density. At optical depth unity , the light reaches a steady state (in an ideal medium) that is independent of the intensity or direction of the original light . This is the case when all paths have the same chance of being traveled. A medium with such behavior is termed optically thick , as opposed to optically thin which is a medium for which there is negligible absorption. The concept of optical depth is also applied to atmospheric and oceanic conditions.|0

Blum Blum Shub ( B.B.S . ) is a pseudorandom number generator proposed in 1986 by Lenore Blum , Manuel Blum and Michael Shapiro. This algorithm uses a general technique called self-reference. It is one of a small class of deterministic pseudo-random number generators known as blum-series generators. It can be proved to be a good source of unpredictable numbers. As of 2009, an attack on the algorithm was found that can recover the secret seed with 25% probability. When using Blum Blum Shub in a simulation, the algorithm should be restarted with a new seed after a small amount of data has been generated.|0

"Bacillus cereus is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, facultatively anaerobic, motile, beta-hemolytic, spore-forming bacterium commonly found in soil, food and marine sponges. The specific name, cereus, meaning ""waxy"" in Latin, refers to the appearance of colonies grown on blood agar. Some strains are harmful to humans and cause foodborne illness, while other strains can be beneficial as probiotics for animals. The bacteria is classically contracted from fried rice dishes that have been sitting at room temperature for hours. B. cereus bacteria are facultative anaerobes, and like other members of the genus Bacillus, can produce protective endospores."|1

"Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the pastime of sliding down snow-covered slopes on skis with fixed-heel bindings, unlike other types of skiing (cross-country, Telemark, or ski jumping), which use skis with free-heel bindings. Whether for recreation or for sport, it is typically practiced at ski resorts, which provide such services as ski lifts, artificial snow making, snow grooming, restaurants, and ski patrol. ""Off-piste"" skiers—those skiing outside ski area boundaries—may employ snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats to deliver them to the top of a slope."|1
"The sousaphone  is a brass instrument in the same family as the more widely known tuba. Created around 1893 by J.W. Pepper at the direction of American bandleader John Philip Sousa (after whom the instrument was then named), it was designed to be easier to play than the concert tuba while standing or marching, as well as to carry the sound of the instrument above the heads of the band. Like the tuba, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, causing them to vibrate or ""buzz"" into a large cupped mouthpiece."|1

ext3, or third extended filesystem, is a journaled file system that is commonly used by the Linux kernel. It used to be the default file system for many popular Linux distributions. Stephen Tweedie first revealed that he was working on extending ext2 in Journaling the Linux ext2fs Filesystem in a 1998 paper, and later in a February 1999 kernel mailing list posting. The filesystem was merged with the mainline Linux kernel in November 2001 from 2.4.15 onward. Its main advantage over ext2 is journaling, which improves reliability and eliminates the need to check the file system after an unclean shutdown.|1

The Motorola MC68010 processor is a 16/32-bit microprocessor from Motorola , released in 1982 as the successor to the Motorola M68000 processor. The architecture of the processor, which was a clean break from Motorola’s previous M68k architecture, introduced several innovations. It included an on-chip microcode ROM and a pipeline which could handle both memory-based and register-based instructions, which allowed it to perform as well as the 80386. However, to achieve this, it had to trade off some features, such as not being superscalar. The final result was the MC68020, which was released in September 1983 and had a performance of about 3 MIPS.|0

Dyson's eternal intelligence concept (the Dyson Scenario), proposed by Freeman Dyson in 1979, proposes a means by which an immortal society of intelligent beings in an open universe may escape the prospect of the heat death of the universe by extending subjective time to infinity even though expending only a finite amount of energy.Bremermann's limit can be invoked to deduce that the amount of time to perform a computation on 1 bit is inversely proportional to the change in energy in the system. As a result, the amount of computations that can be performed grows over time.|1

DeCSS is one of the first free computer programs capable of decrypting content on a commercially produced DVD video disc. Its existence, as well as the existence of the underlying technology that made it possible—the DeCSS software toolkit—were made known in 1999 after Jon Lech Johansen successfully used the toolkit to de-encode a commercial DVD movie, The Matrix Reloaded. Johansen’s original intentions had been merely to see if the content was encrypted or encoded using an open standard, and to determine if the encryption was strong.

A conjugate acid, within the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, is a  chemical compound formed when an acid donates a proton (H+) to a base—in other words, it is a base with a hydrogen ion added to it, as in the reverse reaction it loses a hydrogen ion. On the other hand, a conjugate base is what is left over after an acid has donated a proton during a chemical reaction. Hence, a conjugate base is a species formed by the removal of a proton from an acid, as in the reverse reaction it is able to gain a hydrogen ion.|1
