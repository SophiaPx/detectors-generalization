In philosophy , systems theory , science , and art , emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have  properties its parts do not have on their own. In literature and music, emergence is seen when stories or pieces tell something unexpected as the reader is transported into different scenes or sequences of music. Examples of emergence in stories can include characters making decisions or growing in unexpected directions, often counter to previously held desires or attitudes. Emergence can also be observed in religion, where followers become engrossed with an overall meaning of something that transcends its physical presence, yet such meanings are accessible to those engaged with such stories.|0

A radionuclide (radioactive nuclide, radioisotope or radioactive isotope) is a nuclide that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. This excess energy can be used in one of three ways: emitted from the nucleus as gamma radiation; transferred to one of its electrons to release it as a conversion electron; or used to create and emit a new particle (alpha particle or beta particle) from the nucleus. During those processes, the radionuclide is said to undergo radioactive decay. These emissions are considered ionizing radiation because they are powerful enough to liberate an electron from another atom.|1
A nuclear thermal rocket ( NTR ) is a type of thermal rocket where the heat from a nuclear reaction  is used to provide the energy. NTRs are based on the use of a special reactor which releases the energy to a special liquid hydrogen propellant that creates the rocket thrust. This type of propulsion offers significant performance advantages compared to other space-capable chemical rockets, such as greater thrust, greater specific impulse and much higher exhaust velocities. The advantage in power enables an NTR spacecraft to significantly shorten transit times compared to those possible with chemical-powered vehicles, enabling more distant interplanetary space exploration and vastly faster cross-galactic flights than chemical rockets could achieve.|0

An ion thruster, ion drive, or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. It creates thrust by accelerating ions using electricity.An ion thruster ionizes a neutral gas by extracting some electrons out of atoms, creating a cloud of positive ions. These ion thrusters rely mainly on electrostatics as ions are accelerated by the Coulomb force along an electric field. Temporarily stored electrons are finally reinjected by a neutralizer in the cloud of ions after it has passed through the electrostatic grid, so the gas becomes neutral again and can freely disperse in space without any further electrical interaction with the thruster.|1
"Triskaidekaphobia ( , ; ) is fear or avoidance of the number . It is also a reason for the  fear of Friday the 13th, since this date always falls on the 13th day of a month

Triskaidekaphobia is primarily considered an irrational fear because people suffering from this phobia usually feel anxious regardless of the actual risks. Research has shown that avoidance behavior is more frequent around the unlucky number 13, regardless of an individual's actual level of worry. People suffering from this phobia even tend to take out multiple insurances policies to lessen their chances of having a situation where they would rely on the unlucky number."|0

"Parasports are sports played by people with a disability, including physical and intellectual disabilities. Some parasports are forms of adapted physical activities from existing able-bodied sports, while others have been specifically created for persons with a disability and do not have an able-bodied equivalent. Disability exists in four categories: physical, mental, permanent and temporary. At a competitive level, disability sport classifications are applied to allow people of varying abilities to face similar opposition.EtymologyThe term ""parasports"" arose as a portmanteau of the words paraplegic and sports. Though the sport has since included athletes of disabilities other than paraplegia, the term persists as a catch-all."|1
The Alcubierre drive, Alcubierre warp drive, or Alcubierre metric (referring to metric tensor), is a speculative warp drive idea based on a solution of Einstein's field equations in general relativity as proposed by theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre during his PhD study at the University of Wales, Cardiff, by which a spacecraft could achieve apparent faster-than-light travel if a configurable energy-density field lower than that of vacuum (that is, negative mass) could be created.Rather than exceeding the speed of light within a local reference frame, a spacecraft would traverse distances by contracting space in front of it and expanding space behind it, resulting in effective faster-than-light travel.|1

"The Bussard ramjet is a theoretical method of spacecraft propulsion proposed in 1960 by the physicist Robert W. Bussard ,  using fusion

It takes advantage of the hydrogen atom to create propulsion of interstellar space, extracting the atoms that drift in deep space to provide propellant in a very efficient process. The ramjet would trap the ions and use their kinetic energy to heat and compress the hydrogen which then can undergo a thermonuclear fusion process and resulting ejection which then provides the needed thrust. One challenge of the design, is that it must have enough structural integrity to trap the scattered hydrogen at enormous velocity, typically greater than 220 kilometers per second."|0

In their most common sense, the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation. Their most paradigmatic forms are judging, reasoning, concept formation, problem solving, and deliberation. But other mental processes, like considering an idea, memory, or imagination, are also often included. These processes can happen internally independent of the sensory organs, unlike perception. But when understood in the widest sense, any mental event may be understood as a form of thinking, including perception and unconscious mental processes.|1
Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton's third law. When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction, the accelerated mass will cause a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction to be applied to that system.The force applied on a surface in a direction perpendicular or normal to the surface is also called thrust. Force, and thus thrust, is measured using the International System of Units (SI) in newtons (symbol: N), and represents the amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 meter per second per second.|1
The putamen ( ; from Latin , meaning `` nutshell '' ) is a round structure located at the base  of the forebrain. It has an important role in motor control and is one of the primary areas affected in Parkinson’s disease.

Putamen connections in the human brain are key to understanding and investigating problems related to speech and language, thought, cognition and problem solving. Its functions range from subconscious sensory to working memory activities.|0
"Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare. Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the history of England, they were classified as ""histories"" in the First Folio. The Roman tragedies—Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus—are also based on historical figures, but because their sources were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories. Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy."|1
Magma is the molten or semi-molten natural material from which all igneous rocks are formed . Magma is found beneath  the surface of the Earth and is made up of different gases and particles, mostly oxygen, silicon and magnesium. This liquid rock has tremendous power and has the potential to break through the earth’s surface and cause explosive eruptions with streams of lava and fire. Magma helps create island, the slopes of volcanoes, even seas and the remarkable variety of beautiful igneous rock in our landscapes. These eruptions often take place due to plates converging and magma spilling out through magma chambers and long-standing volcanic edifices.|0

"A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura (literally without tail in Ancient Greek). The oldest fossil ""proto-frog"" Triadobatrachus is known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their split from other amphibians may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforest. Frogs account for around 88% of extant amphibian species."|1

A mass driver or electromagnetic catapult is a proposed method of non-rocket spacelaunch which would use a linear motor to accelerate and catapult payloads up to high speeds. Existing and contemplated mass drivers use coils of wire energized by electricity to make electromagnets, though a rotary mass driver has also been proposed. Sequential firing of a row of electromagnets accelerates the payload along a path. After leaving the path, the payload continues to move due to momentum.Although any device used to propel a ballistic payload is technically a mass driver, in this context a mass driver is essentially a coilgun that magnetically accelerates a package consisting of a magnetizable holder containing a payload.|1

"A monopropellant rocket ( or `` monochemical rocket '' ) is a rocket that uses a single chemical as its 

The most common monopropellant is hydrazine. When it is forced through a nozzle, it rapidly decomposes into nitrogen and hydrogen which generate the thrust for propulsion. Unlike a bipropellant rocket, it does not require another source of fuel like oxygen, which makes it much simpler in design and a little lighter and thus more efficient. Even so, it generally has lower performance in comparison to other propellants, since the gas produced by the decomposition of the propellant is less thermally efficient."|0
"Akasha or Akash ( Sanskrit ) means space or sky or æther in traditional Indian cosmology , depending on the  context. It is conceived as a vast nonmaterial realm, sometimes compared to the concept of

Akasha is believed to be a pre-physical infrastructure of a mental environment through which sound and gesture can transmit and articulate objects and energies. As a platform it has the capacity to comprehend both immutable physical rules that function and our conscious intentions, facilitating communication and contributing to individual harmony. Therefore it acts as a mediator between conscious and unconscious, rational and irrational."|0
Zooarchaeology ( sometimes incorrectly archaeozoology ) , also known as faunal analysis , is a branch of archaeology that studies  animal remains recovered from archaeological sites. It allows archaeologists to infer the behaviour, lifestyle and diet of past human communities. Zooarchaeologists study different types of bones, such as bone tools, carcasses used for feasting and patterns of use-wear to develop an understanding of human culture. Bones may also tell stories about subsistence practices, activities related to domestic and wild animal domestication, movement and availability of food resources and interconnections between communities over time.|0
Nuclear engineering is the branch of engineering concerned with the application of breaking down  atomic nuclei (fission) or of combining atomic nuclei (fusion),  or with the application of other sub-atomic processes based on the principles of nuclear physics.

The Alcubierre drive , Alcubierre warp drive , or Alcubierre metric ( referring to metric tensor ) , is a  speculative idea based on a solution of Einstein's field equations in general relativity as proposed by theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre , by which a spacecraft could achieve faster than light travel . In theory, using this drive would require a large amount of energy. It relies on two hypothetical elements that do not yet exist; exotic matter which is used to bend the fabric of spacetime, and a hull to form an enclosement field to prevent distortion of the environment in which the craft travels.|0
The boa knot is a modern  binding knot invented by weaver Peter Collingwood in 1996. His intention was to develop a knot that would hold well when the constricted object was cut close to the winds of the knot.The boa knot is related to the strangle knot and the double constrictor knot. It combines both the structure and qualities of these other two knots. The boa knot can be very difficult to untie and is inappropriate when frequent or fast untying is needed. The knotted part needs to lie over a convex surface to hold.Start with making two loops that spiral upwards in a clockwise manner.|1

"The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and most animals including a few fish ,  and

breathing and exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place in the alveoli of the lungs. These air sacks are formed of a double-layered wall; made up of a dense collagen and elastic fiber network, enabling the stretching and contaction of these organs to expand and fill up with oxygen rich air as the body inhales, and pushes out oxygen depleted air as it exhales. As a result of these activities, the surface area of these organ is an incredible 40 times bigger than the outside surface of the entire body."|0

"A bong ( also known as a water pipe ) is a filtration device generally used for smoking cannabis ,  tobacco or other herbal substances

The bong works by filling it with water before passing the substance through. The water provides the smoke a certain resistance allowing more oxygen, while releasing certain amount of coolness with its passing. By passing through the bong, this produces the smoke which has gone through water resulting in larger cooler yet smoother hits than if they hadn’t been passed through the device. Its efficiency increases due to added ingredients such as lemon, honey or ice cubes that are added inside the tube part."|0
"In electronics , a multiplexer ( or mux ; spelled sometimes as multiplexor ) , also known as a data  selector 

A multiplexer is an electronic device which allows many analog or digital input signals to be combined into one output. It acts as a switch that selects one input from many and connects it to a single output line. In the case of a 4:1 MUX, the input signals are then converted and grouped into four bits to control which line is to be sent to the output terminal. Each bit of the MUX control input affects whether the other three lines will be routed directly to the output terminal."|0

"Relative density , or specific gravity , is the ratio of the density ( mass of a unit volume )  of a substance

Relative density is usually expressed with respect to water for liquids and solids and for gases relative density is expressed as specific gravity. It helps us to understand the change in state and can help us compare various components that make up a solution. For example, petrol consists of several different compounds and using relative density, it is easier to understand the separation process that takes place when they are put into a column."|0

"In chemistry , an aldehyde is an organic compound containing a functional group with the structure −C ( H ) =O

An aldehyde differs from other types of carboxylic acids like ketones, in which the carbonyl group is linked to two alkyl or aryl groups. Most aldehydes are produced by dehydrogenation of primary or secondary alcohols or oxidation of primary or secondary alcohols with mineral acids like sulphuric acid or hydrogen peroxide. Aldehydes form an important class of compounds in nature due to their occurrence as flavour and aroma compounds in foodstuff and fruits and also due to the vital role they play as intermediary metabolites in a number of biotic metabolic processes."|0
"Éraic ( or eric ) was the Irish equivalent of the Welsh galanas and the Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian weregild , 

Eric was the recognised measure of compensation paid for injury, damage or loss and for other grievances of varying magnitudes. Unlike the Anglo Saxon or Scandinavian form of Weregild , however, this ancient Irish custom seems to have measured injury and due payments with respect to social status, being tailored more to people rather than inanimate objects or things. The brehon laws recorded and are firmly the biggest source for this early legal practice, considered a delicately practiced albeit certainly and utterly important moral point."|0

An inverse multiplexer (often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX) allows a data stream to be broken into multiple lower data rate communication links. An inverse multiplexer differs from a demultiplexer because the multiple output streams from the former stay inter-related, whereas those from the latter are unrelated. An inverse multiplexer is the opposite of a multiplexer  in that it divides one high-speed link into multiple low-speed links, whereas a multiplexer combines multiple low-speed links into one high-speed link.This provides an end to end connection of several times the data rate available on each of the low rate data links.|1
A seed is an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering. The formation of the seed is part of the process of reproduction in seed plants, the spermatophytes, including the gymnosperm and angiosperm plants.Seeds are the product of the ripened ovule, after fertilization by pollen and some growth within the mother plant. The embryo develops from the zygote, and the seed coat from the integuments of the ovule. Seeds have been an important development in the reproduction and success of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants, relative to more primitive plants such as ferns, mosses and liverworts, which do not have seeds and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves.|1

Dekker 's algorithm is the first known correct solution to the mutual exclusion problem in concurrent programming . The solution  solves the critical section problem and prevents the possibility of multiple processes operating at once within the same code. The solution implemented by Dekker involves setting flags and constantly checking to see if those flags have been set or reset in the various sections of the code. In this way, each process would have to wait and have access to that section of code in turn, giving exclusive access to critical resources while not allowing simultaneous access by other processes.|0

Genus ( plural genera ) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms as  well as viruses. Genera form the category below family and above species in the hierarchy. Each genus should be divided into a variety of subordinate categories called species and are considered a unit system in which its component species share a common ancestry. At times, due to the process of adaptation to an environment and interbreeding, genera cannot accurately be identified according to conventional binomial nomenclature. Thus, molecular or morphological analysis must be used to pinpoint its particular species which contain members possessing distinct and remarkable similarities.|0

The Burrows–Wheeler transform ( BWT , also called block-sorting compression ) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters . The BWT offers faster searching times by shifting much of the overhead for data lookup away from compression and to improved pattern searches. It does this by converting repetitive strings into fewer blocks, meaning searching large quantities of data is more time efficient. Also, since all alphabets have to have special characters which never repeat, these can be clustered using BWT thus significantly reduce their cost in terms of bit rate. This is incredibly useful in data intensive environments.|0

"Thermonuclear fusion is the process of atoms combining or “fusing” together with huge amounts of heat. There are two forms of thermonuclear fusion: uncontrolled, in which the resulting energy is released in an uncontrolled manner, as it is in thermonuclear weapons (""hydrogen bombs"") and in most stars; and controlled, where the fusion reactions take place in an environment allowing some or all of the energy released to be harnessed for constructive purposes.Temperature requirementsTemperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles, so by heating the material it will gain energy."|1
Magma  is the molten or semi-molten natural material from which all igneous rocks are formed. Magma is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and evidence of magmatism has also been discovered on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals and gas bubbles.Magma is produced by melting of the mantle or the crust in various tectonic settings, which on Earth include subduction zones, continental rift zones, mid-ocean ridges and hotspots. Mantle and crustal melts migrate upwards through the crust where they are thought to be stored in magma chambers or trans-crustal crystal-rich mush zones.|1

"In the philosophy of mathematics , the abstraction of actual infinity involves the acceptance ( if the axiom of infinity  holds ) that infinitely many entities can exist and be conceived of, regardless

The infinity of a concept and the infinity of sets within that concept both involve acceptance that not all individual objects need to be nameable in order to count. Objects may form ordered sets under such topics as natural numbers, finite set cardinalities, and transfinite sets. No matter what an object is called or classified, infinite sets will encompass their concept with valid application."|0

A hot air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft consisting of a bag, called an envelope, which contains heated air. Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid propane. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant, since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere.|1
Wind tunnels are large tubes with air blowing through them which are used to replicate the interaction between air and an object flying through the air or moving along the ground. Researchers use wind tunnels to learn more about how an aircraft will fly. NASA uses wind tunnels to test scale models of aircraft and spacecraft. Some wind tunnels are large enough to contain full-size versions of vehicles. The wind tunnel moves air around an object, making it seem as if the object is flying.Most of the time, large powerful fans suck air through the tube.|1

Emissions trading is a market-based approach to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives for reducing the emissions of pollutants . Emissions trading allows for companies and/or organizations that have limited capacity to emit polluting gases to buy the rights from other polluting organizations. As polluters, who previously lacked incentives to reduce their pollution output, benefit from this incentive. Furthermore, emissions trading establishes pollution thresholds in addition to the caps enforced. The cap ensures that an established emissions limit, thereby giving control to regulatory agencies, but the tradeable allowances further induce producers and companies to decrease pollution, rewarding the largest emitter reductions.|0

Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents. Legal adoptions permanently transfer all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parents to the adoptive parents.Unlike guardianship or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption, while others used less formal means (notably contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of filiation).|1
In chemistry , a nucleophile is a chemical species that forms bonds with electrophiles by donating an electron pair . Nucleophiles tend to be negatively charged ions (or molecules) and are found mostly in solutions. They act as either Lewis bases or electron pair donors, so they need an electron pair of their own in order to bond with an electrophile. There are three major types of nucleophiles: negative ions (like anions or radicals), dipolar aprotic molecules, and dipolar protic molecules. A protic molecule has at least one hydrogen atom bound to an oxygen or nitrogen atom, making it relatively soluble in water and a solvent.|0

The Hippocratic Oath is an oath of ethics historically taken by physicians. It is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. In its original form, it requires a new physician to swear, by a number of healing gods, to uphold specific ethical standards. The oath is the earliest expression of medical ethics in the Western world, establishing several principles of medical ethics which remain of paramount significance today. These include the principles of medical confidentiality and non-maleficence. As the seminal articulation of certain principles that continue to guide and inform medical practice, the ancient text is of more than historic and symbolic value.|1

In chemistry, a nucleophile is a chemical species that forms bonds with electrophiles by donating an electron pair. All molecules and ions with a free pair of electrons or at least one pi bond can act as nucleophiles. Because nucleophiles donate electrons, they are Lewis bases. Nucleophilic describes the affinity of a nucleophile to bond with positively charged atomic nuclei. Nucleophilicity, sometimes referred to as nucleophile strength, refers to a substance's nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the affinity of atoms. Neutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohols and water are named solvolysis.|1

The Avignon Papacy was the period from 1309 to 1376 during which seven successive popes resided in Avignon (then in the Kingdom of Arles, part of the Holy Roman Empire, now in France) rather than in Rome. The situation arose from the conflict between the papacy and the French crown, culminating in the death of Pope Boniface VIII after his arrest and maltreatment by Philip IV of France. Following the further death of Pope Benedict XI, Philip forced a deadlocked conclave to elect the French Clement V as pope in 1305.|1
In the English language , the word nigger is an ethnic slur typically used against black people , especially African  Americans . Nigger has long been used as a source of demeaning and demoting African American culture. However, recently, some of the world's leading African Americans have been utilizing the word in a far more nuanced context and deliberately employing it as a term of affection and pride in order to retake its power away from those who might intend it harm. This same concept of “reclamation” has gained increasing traction among younger generations.|0

Pali is a Middle Indo-Aryan liturgical language native to the Indian subcontinent . It is widely studied because it is  the language of much of the earliest extant literature of Buddhism. Pali's core scripts and literature, including Tipitaka and Milindapañha, still hold significant spiritual and cultural relevance to this day, as well as throughout south Asia and beyond. Moreover, due to the language's simplicity, memorization and knowledge can spread relatively easily between Buddhists across cultures. Since most Buddhist and Pali related material remain relevant, it has allowed Buddhism to last for thousands of years across several continents and across different times and cultures.|0

Isotope separation is the process of concentrating specific isotopes of a chemical element by removing other isotopes . The use  of isotope separation can be seen in medicine as well as in energy production. Isotopes of some elements have become essential for specific industrial processes and isotope separation can be used for its enrichment. Nuclear fission is another application for the use of isotope separation. Separating uranium 235 from the other fissile uranium isotopes to create enriched fuel for power reactors is a major use for the process. However, such a process comes with challenges as enriched uranium is usually difficult to separate without harming its composition or inducing radioactive emissions.|0
"Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are often caught in the wild but may also be caught from stocked bodies of water. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. ""Fishing"" may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate. In addition to being caught to be eaten, fish are caught as recreational pastimes."|1

A political prisoner is someone imprisoned for their political activity . The political offense is not always the official reason  they were incarcerated; most likely, the governing force makes up an accusation to cover the real reason. Often times a political prisoner faces discrimination such as their books or letters being censored by their captors or mistreatment because of their political beliefs. Political prisoners are forced to stay quiet for fear of retaliation, usually more harsh incarceration, although in some cases torture or execution. Political prisoners in some countries can receive solidarity from NGOs or world-wide support if their cases are publicized.|0

"The subset sum problem ( SSP ) is a decision problem in computer science . In its most general formulation , SSP asks whether a set of positive integers has a subset whose sum is a given positive integer T.

In other words, this problem looks for an ""answer yes/no"" response whether an exhaustive search through the solution space could be carried out to find the correct set that fits this criteria. In practice, this type of problem is known to be extremely difficult and difficult to solve using an efficient algorithm in polynomial time, so researchers are working hard to design polynomial-time algorithms that efficiently solve the SSP problem."|0

The work premiered on 30 September 1791 at Schikaneder's theatre, the Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna, just two months before the composer's premature death. Still a staple of the opera repertory, its popularity was reflected by two immediate sequels, Peter Winter's Das Labyrinth oder Der Kampf mit den Elementen.|1
"A seal is a device for making an impression in wax, clay, paper, or some other medium, including an embossment on paper, and is also the impression thus made. The original purpose was to authenticate a document, or to prevent interference with a package or envelope by applying a seal which had to be broken to open the container (hence the modern English verb ""to seal"", which implies secure closing without an actual wax seal).The seal-making device is also referred to as the seal matrix or die; the imprint it creates as the seal impression (or, more rarely, the sealing)."|1

Zooarchaeology (sometimes incorrectly archaeozoology), also known as faunal analysis, is a branch of archaeology that studies remains of animals from archaeological sites. Faunal remains are the items left behind when an animal dies. These include bones, shells, hair, chitin, scales, hides, proteins and DNA. Of these items, bones and shells are the ones that occur most frequently at archaeological sites where faunal remains can be found. Most of the time, a majority of these faunal remains do not survive. They often decompose or break because of various circumstances.|1

An infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to the infectious agents and the toxins they produce. An infectious disease, also known as a transmissible disease or communicable disease, is an illness resulting from an infection.Infections can be caused by a wide range of pathogens, most prominently bacteria and viruses. Hosts can fight infections using their immune system. Mammalian hosts react to infections with an innate response, often involving inflammation, followed by an adaptive response.Specific medications used to treat infections include antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, antiprotozoals, and antihelminthics.|1
A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed (or re-entrant); otherwise, it is open.The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour. Creating a program to find a knight's tour is a common problem given to computer science students.|1

Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to femininity and masculinity and differentiating between them . Depending on the context , these characteristics can be socially constructed, or biologically/naturally determined. Social norms in different cultures vary regarding the dividing lines between male/female, feminine/masculine and emphasize certain behaviours at the expense of others. In modern times, we have seen society become more open towards issues of gender than before. For example, issues of gender roles are more publicly discussed and more initiatives that promote gender equity are present. Even further, topics of nonbinary genders and issues of LGBTQIA+ rights are gaining acceptance and growing understanding within different communities around the world.|0
"Bi-curious is a term for a person, usually someone who is a heterosexual, who is curious or open about engaging in sexual activity with a person whose sex differs from that of their usual sexual partners. The term is sometimes used to describe a broad continuum of sexual orientation between heterosexuality and bisexuality. Such continuums include mostly-heterosexual or mostly-homosexual, but these can be self-identified without identifying as bisexual. The terms heteroflexible and homoflexible are mainly applied to bi-curious people, though some authors distinguish heteroflexibility and homoflexibility as lacking the ""wish to experiment with sexuality"" implied by the bi-curious label."|1

Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton 's third law . When a system expels or accelerates mass  in one direction, the accelerated mass will cause a proportional but opposite force on that system. For example, thrust is generated by a propulsion system on an aircraft when it ejects accelerated mass such as in jet propulsion, in a rocket engine, or with a propeller in an aeroplane. Farther afield, even organisms have evolved certain organs or specialised functions in order to provide thrust to their bodies and enable them to swim, or even to fly or move rapidly about in search for food or away from predators.|0

Carbon emission trading for  and other greenhouse gases has been introduced in China, the European Union and other countries as a key tool for climate change mitigation. Other schemes include sulfur dioxide and other pollutants.In an emissions trading scheme, a central authority or governmental body allocates or sells a limited number (a ""cap"") of permits that allow a discharge of a specific quantity of a specific pollutant over a set time period."|1
"In combinatorics and in experimental design , a Latin square is an n × n array filled with n different  symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column

Latin squares are useful in designing experiments that involve combining two factors. This can be demonstrated by looking at an example from an agricultural trial. Suppose the goal was to compare how four different plants (symbols A, B, C and D) grow in three different types of soil (numbers 1,2, and 3). Latin squares can provide the arrangement for this trial, ensuring that no soil is tested with the same plant twice."|0

In economics , inflation refers to a general progressive increase in prices of goods and services in an economy . Inflation affects both businesses and households and if left uncontrolled, can have detrimental effects on economic growth. If inflation is too high, it can choke economic growth, particularly when workers don't have enough purchasing power to afford essentials such as food, clothing and shelter. When inflation gets too high, consumers’ spending power also falls, causing business investments and jobs to disappear. To address these concerns, governments strive to reduce and maintain the average level of prices, setting fiscal and monetary policies accordingly.|0

The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one . It starts by asking if repeating the two arithmetic operations (which are simply dividing by 2 and multiplying by 3 when a number is odd) to any number will eventually reach 1. Researchers and mathematicians are intrigued because this would mean any integer would terminate eventually when ran through the two simple arithmetic operations, though it has never been proven yet. For this reason, researchers and mathematicians alike continually work and propose potential theories that attempt to solve the Collatz Conjecture.|0
Purple is any of a variety of colors with hue between red and blue. In the RGB color model used in computer and television screens, purples are produced by mixing red and blue light. In the RYB color model historically used by painters, purples are created with a combination of red and blue pigments. In the CMYK color model used in printing, purples are made by combining magenta pigment with either cyan pigment, black pigment, or both.Purple has long been associated with royalty, originally because Tyrian purple dye, made from crushed shells, was extremely expensive in antiquity.|1

"In the philosophy of mathematics, the abstraction of actual infinity involves the acceptance (if the axiom of infinity is included) of infinite entities as given, actual and completed objects. These might include the set of natural numbers, extended real numbers, transfinite numbers, or even an infinite sequence of rational numbers. Actual infinity is to be contrasted with potential infinity, in which a non-terminating process (such as ""add 1 to the previous number"") produces a sequence with no last element, and where each individual result is finite and is achieved in a finite number of steps."|1

Classless Inter-Domain Routing ( CIDR ) is a method for allocating IP addresses and for IP routing . The Internet  is growing constantly, and it's becoming more important to make sure that each IP address is unique. CIDR helps by breaking the IP addresses into blocks, making it easier to maintain control over which IP addresses are allocated to which user. With this process, every user gets their own section of addresses rather than relying on the availability of shared address blocks. CIDR also helps network operators allocate a single IP address for all their IP routed devices and create more efficient use of IP addressing.|0

"Theories of political behavior , as an aspect of political science , attempt to quantify and explain the influences that  define

politics and policy formation. One prominent theory, modern rational choice theory, outlines how rational individuals weigh preferences, access available information and, as a result, decide on a course of action. Political behavior is heavily intertwined with socio-cultural, economical and other such non-political components. Issues of religion, personal values and income levels of course, greatly shape behavior related to political issues. Democratic governments create arenas where issues are democratically evaluated with public participation on the forefront and official records public and known."|0

Metaphone is a phonetic algorithm, published by Lawrence Philips in 1990, for indexing words by their English pronunciation. It fundamentally improves on the Soundex algorithm by using information about variations and inconsistencies in English spelling and pronunciation to produce a more accurate encoding, which does a better job of matching words and names which sound similar. As with Soundex, similar-sounding words should share the same keys. Metaphone is available as a built-in operator in a number of systems.Philips later produced a new version of the algorithm, which he named Double Metaphone.|1
"In the 1980s , the telecommunications industry expected that digital services would follow much the same pattern as voice services :

It was envisioned that most digital services would initially focus on consumers for high-end features such as video conferencing, e-mail, and home banking services. Business users had access to business networks that incorporated data transmission using the open X.25 system and the ITXC packet-switched systems. These two were early standards for business networks that facilitated applications such as word processing and access to databases. But it became clear that such services weren't revolutionary, nor did they demand a highly personalized experience."|0

"Fall back is a feature of a modem protocol in data communication whereby two communicating modems which experience data corruption (due to line noise, for example) can renegotiate with each other to use a lower-speed connection. Fall forward is a corresponding feature whereby two modems which have ""fallen back"" to a lower speed can later return to the higher speed if the connection improves.A common feature modems was the concept of fallback, allowing them to talk to less-capable modems. During the call initiation the modem would play a series of signals into the line and wait for the remote modem to ""answer"" them."|1

Menstruation (also known as a period and many other colloquial terms) is the regular discharge of blood and mucosal tissue from the inner lining of the uterus through the vagina. The menstrual cycle is characterized by the rise and fall of hormones. Menstruation is triggered by falling progesterone levels and is a sign that pregnancy has not occurred.The first period, a point in time known as menarche, usually begins between the ages of 12 and 15. Menstruation starting as young as 8 years would still be considered normal. The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world, and earlier in the developed world.|1
The War Game is a 1966 British pseudo-documentary film that depicts a nuclear war and its aftermath . Written ,  produced and directed by Peter Watkins , it originally screened with very limited distribution. Although it did not win an Oscar in 1967, the film still managed to put a massive strain on the post war mentality that had fostered the peace movement. People reacted strongly, demanding governmental transparency and recognition that a nuclear apocalypse was an imminent reality. Critics pointed out its usefulness as an educational tool and praised its cultural impact on helping to stimulate discussion on matters such as the morality of nuclear warfare and civilian readiness for war.|0
Genus  (plural genera ) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms as well as viruses. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.E.g. Panthera leo (lion) and Panthera onca (jaguar) are two species within the genus Panthera. Panthera is a genus within the family Felidae.The composition of a genus is determined by taxonomists. The standards for genus classification are not strictly codified, so different authorities often produce different classifications for genera.|1

"Peperomia ( radiator plant ) is one of the two large genera of the family Piperaceae . Most of them  are compact perennial plants

Grown for their ornamental foliage and forms, the various species of peperomia are quite varied, making it the perfect houseplant. These plants prefer moist, yet well-draining soil, indirect sunlight, and they should be protected from drafts or intense direct sunlight. Care should be taken with some peperomias such as the pale green or reddish type with thin delicate leaves that are very easily damaged in overly cold or too dry conditions."|0
"Isotope separation is the process of concentrating specific isotopes of a chemical element by removing other isotopes. The use of the nuclides produced is varied. The largest variety is used in research (e.g. in chemistry where atoms of ""marker"" nuclide are used to figure out reaction mechanisms). By tonnage, separating natural uranium into enriched uranium and depleted uranium is the largest application. In the following text, mainly the uranium enrichment is considered. This process is crucial in the manufacture of uranium fuel for nuclear power plants, and is also required for the creation of uranium-based nuclear weapons."|1

In economics, inflation refers to a general progressive increase in prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. The opposite of inflation is deflation, a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualised percentage change in a general price index.Prices will not all increase at the same rates. Attaching a representative value to a set of prices is an instance of the index number problem.|1

Hilbert 's paradox of the Grand Hotel ( colloquial : Infinite Hotel Paradox or Hilbert 's Hotel ) is a  thought experiment : a hotel with infinitely many rooms. It is a scenario, generally used to illustrate a problem or point in logic or philosophy, usually related to the fact that the infinite, in mathematics, can behave in ways much different from finite sets of numbers. The scenario suggests a fully booked hotel with an infinite number of guests, yet with room for one more—but how can this be possible in an infinite space with no vacancies?|0
Fall back is a feature of a modem protocol in data communication whereby two communicating modems which experience data corruption  can exchange additional error checking data in an effort to reconnect. Fallback is often needed if errors are detected in the stream of transmitted data or the packets that indicate successful connection attempts. Generally speaking, when fallback fails, modems send further communication instructions over telephone networks. In the case of fallback, all systems must follow the guidelines to accurately exchange, assess, and comprehend transmitted information so it can reconnect with the modems, assuming that both modems have been connected through telecommunications and communicate with compatible speeds.|0
A finger is a limb of the body and a type of digit, an organ of manipulation and sensation found in the hands of most of the Tetrapods, so also with humans and other primates. Most land vertebrates have five fingers (Pentadactyly).Land vertebrate fingers The five-rayed anterior limbs of terrestrial vertebrates can be derived phylogenetically from the pectoral fins of fish. Within the taxa of the terrestrial vertebrates, the basic pentadactyl plan, and thus also the fingers and phalanges, undergoe many variations.Morphologically the different fingers of terrestrial vertebrates are homolog. The wings of birds and those of bats are not homologous, they are analogue flight organs.|1
Auger electron spectroscopy (AES; pronounced  in French) is a common analytical technique used specifically in the study of surfaces and, more generally, in the area of materials science. It is a form of electron spectroscopy that relies on the Auger effect, based on the analysis of energetic electrons emitted from an excited atom after a series of internal relaxation events. The Auger effect was discovered independently by both Lise Meitner and Pierre Auger in the 1920s. Though the discovery was made by Meitner and initially reported in the journal Zeitschrift für Physik in 1922, Auger is credited with the discovery in most of the scientific community.|1

"In celestial mechanics , escape velocity or escape speed is the minimum speed needed for a free , non-propelled object  to escape from the gravitational attraction of a massive body. The escape velocity can depend upon both the body's and the object's parameters, like the two body's masses and their distance. A craft with propulsion powerful enough to exceed escape velocity can leave a gravitational well and ""break free"" of it, allowing to leave it and travel further away, under its own inertia and being no longer subjected to the body's gravity field."|0

He personally kept records of royal expenditures and appraised difficult issues submitted by local officials. By reducing local fees and forbidding unfair taxation, the taxation crisis at that time was settled and fiscal reform began during his rule. Furthering fiscal reform, he limited tax on most agriculture products and collect tribute. These provided comfort to the farming public. His generous public works brought political, social and cultural unity in Japan.|0
Wind tunnels are large tubes with air blowing through them which are used to replicate the interaction between air and  objects as they travel through it. They can be used to design cars, rockets and other devices before they're built or launched. The air speeds and pressures in the tunnel can be adjusted to get an exact representation of the drag, lift, and pressure an object would experience as it travelled in different atmospheric conditions. Wind tunnels can also help to pinpoint where improvements need to be made by showing designers the advantages and weaknesses in the vehicle design.|0
The Viking program consisted of a pair of identical American space probes, Viking 1 and Viking 2, which landed on Mars in 1976. Each spacecraft was composed of two main parts: an orbiter designed to photograph the surface of Mars from orbit, and a lander designed to study the planet from the surface. The orbiters also served as communication relays for the landers once they touched down.The Viking program grew from NASA's earlier, even more ambitious, Voyager Mars program, which was not related to the successful Voyager deep space probes of the late 1970s.|1

"The oxidation state, or oxidation number, is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to different atoms were fully ionic. It describes the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state may be positive, negative or zero. While fully ionic bonds are not found in nature, many bonds exhibit strong ionicity, making oxidation state a useful predictor of charge.The oxidation state of an atom does not represent the ""real"" formal charge on that atom, or any other actual atomic property."|1
The history of Southeast Asia covers the people of Southeast Asia from prehistory to the present in two distinct sub-regions . The western-most region, termed Mainland Southeast Asia, is commonly covered by the 20th century by its shared colonial legacies to France, the United Kingdom and laterally, the US. The southeastern-most sub-region known as Island Southeast Asia incorporates nations now integrated within existing geopolitical states. From ancient civilizations whose wisdom brought riches, traders in such things as jade and spice, kingdoms where the achievements in arts, sciences, literature and statecraft rivalled other regional neighbors and Empires eventually fractured, colonialism along with assimilation spread quickly.|0

It has multi-mission, multi-target precision-strike ability, and can be launched from multiple air, sea, and ground platforms, including the Predator drone."|1
"The Lhotshampa or Lhotsampa  people are a heterogeneous Bhutanese people of Nepalese descent. ""Lhotshampa"", which means ""southern borderlanders"" in Dzongkha, began to be used by the Bhutanese state in the second half of the twentieth century to refer to the population of Nepali origin in the south of the country. Starting in 2007, most of the Lhotshampas, or Bhutanese Refugees, were resettled to various countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. the number of Lhotshampa in Nepal is significantly lower than that in the United States and other countries where they have resettled."|1
"The Viking program consisted of a pair of identical American space probes , Viking 1 and Viking 2 , which  had separate orbits around Mars 

The Vikings operated in Mars's orbit for multiple years and took photos, sent back geological data, studied the planet's atmosphere, surface temperatures, and finally attempted the search for the first primitive forms of Martian life. Each of the Vikings released a robotic craft to land on the surface of Mars. On July 20th, 1976, Viking 1 became the first spacecraft to land safely on the planet’s surface."|0
A resistojet is a method of spacecraft propulsion (electric propulsion) that provides thrust by heating a, typically non-reactive, fluid. Heating is usually achieved by sending electricity through a resistor consisting of a hot incandescent filament, with the expanded gas expelled through a conventional nozzle.Resistojets have been flown in space since 1965 on board military Vela satellites. However, they only became used in commercial applications in 1980 with the launch of the first satellites in the INTELSAT-V program. Many GEO spacecraft, and all 95 Iridium, used Aerojet MR-501/MR-502 series resistojet engines.|1
The Little Ice Age (LIA) was a period of regional cooling, particularly pronounced in the North Atlantic region, that occurred after the Medieval Warm Period. It was not a true ice age of global extent. The term was introduced into scientific literature by François E. Matthes in 1939. The time period has been conventionally defined as extending from the 16th to the 19th centuries, but some experts prefer an alternative timespan from about 1300 to about 1850.The NASA Earth Observatory notes three particularly cold intervals. One began about 1650, another about 1770, and the last in 1850, all of which were separated by intervals of slight warming.|1

"In quantum mechanics, counterfactual definiteness (CFD) is the ability to speak ""meaningfully"" of the definiteness of the results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e., the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured). The term ""counterfactual definiteness"" is used in discussions of physics calculations, especially those related to the phenomenon called quantum entanglement and those related to the Bell inequalities. In such discussions ""meaningfully"" means the ability to treat these unmeasured results on an equal footing with measured results in statistical calculations."|1

"Fermat's principle, also known as the principle of least time, is the link between ray optics and wave optics. In its original ""strong"" form, Fermat's principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time. In order to be true in all cases, this statement must be weakened by replacing the ""least"" time with a time that is ""stationary"" with respect to variations of the path — so that a deviation in the path causes, at most, a second-order change in the traversal time."|1

The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. It  concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.The conjecture is named after mathematician Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate.|1

An ion thruster , ion drive , or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion . Ion engines take in a supply of propellant (typically an inert gas) and then strip electrons from it creating a plasma. A strong electric field accelerates the ions to high velocities that can exceed up to a maximum of 90km/s.

By maintaining steady thrust, they are able to slowly accelerate over time with better fuel efficiency that traditional propulsion systems.|0
"The Etruscan civilization of ancient Italy covered a territory , at its greatest extent , of roughly what is now  Tuscany

The Etruscan civilization left behind their unique art, religious practices, technological skills and customs, still observed in parts of Tuscany today. One interesting feature was their painting of male figure-narratives, stories carved into clay discs (of Etruscan craftsmanship). These discs have images of Etruscan citizens facing a challenge, rendered with symbols that help to decode their life and values. Other art pieces including chariot decors, necklaces and amber artifacts give visitors an insight into the historic power and progress of the Etruscan empire."|0

The Maunder Minimum , also known as the `` prolonged sunspot minimum '' , was a period around 1645 to  1715 during which sunspots were exceedingly rare, and new discoveries revealed a stark contrast to previous records of sunspots activity. In addition, this was a time period known for abnormally cold weather due to less sun radiation reaching the surface of the Earth. It was believed to be a result of a decline in the north-south component of the Sun’s magnetic field. This contributed to lower solar activity and stronger interplanetary magnetic fields, which in turn results in weaker Aurora Borealis displays.|0
"A wide area network ( WAN ) is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area . Wide  area networks are used for a variety of reasons, but one of the primary reasons is the ability to enable businesses to share information quickly.

The problem is known to be NP-complete. Moreover, some restricted variants of it are NP-complete too, for example: The variant in which all inputs are positive. The variant in which inputs may be positive or negative, and . For example, given the set , the answer is yes because the subset  sums to zero.|1
"In Euclidean geometry , an affine transformation , or an affinity ( from the Latin , affinis , `` connected  to '' ), is a 

type of geometric transformation that preserves points , straight lines and planes, but not necessarily distances or angles. Any homothety ( the case where scales and orientation are preserved ) is an affine transformation. Thus, an affine transformation maps all straight lines in the image onto other straight lines. Such a mapping allows all components of the image to change simultaneously. This makes affine transformations particularly important when attempting to analyze scenes containing structure such as roads, pipelines, grids and waterways."|0

A resistojet is a method of spacecraft propulsion ( electric propulsion ) that provides thrust by heating a , typically  nonreactive , working fluid and exhausting the hot gases at high velocity. This working fluid is pumped at a high pressure in the resistojet, which raises its temperature due to increased internal friction. A metal liner in the exhaust system accelerates the heated gas. This gas exits at a high speed as a beam of hot gas. As a result of this beam of heated gas being used as thrust, it can create long durations of acceleration, essential for long duration missions, such as deep space exploration.|0

"The Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT, also called block-sorting compression) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters. This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by techniques such as move-to-front transform and run-length encoding. More importantly, the transformation is reversible, without needing to store any additional data except the position of the first original character.

"In quantum mechanics , counterfactual definiteness ( CFD ) is the ability to speak `` meaningfully '' of the definiteness  of the results of measurements even in situations where the particular outcome does not occur

The concept of counterfactual definiteness originated from Bell's Theorem, which raised questions about non-local influence. According to the theorem, if counterfactual definiteness holds then nature is using superluminal or 'spooky' forces to bring about agreement of pre-existing elements without signaling. CFD describes physical measurements on entangled systems as having definite but uncertain results that do not match up with our intuition."|0

The History of East Asia generally encompasses the histories of China , Japan , Korea , and Mongolia from prehistoric  times to the present. The history of these nations has been strongly linked and there has been immense cross-fertilisation and exchange in the region throughout much of its history.
