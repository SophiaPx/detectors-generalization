"A political prisoner is someone imprisoned for their political activity. The political offense is not always the official reason for the prisoner's detention.There is no internationally recognized legal definition of the concept, although numerous similar definitions have been proposed by various organizations and scholars, and there is a general consensus among scholars that ""individuals have been sanctioned by legal systems and imprisoned by political regimes not for their violation of codified laws but for their thoughts and ideas that have fundamentally challenged existing power relations"". The status of a political prisoner is generally awarded to individuals based on declarations of non-governmental organizations like Amnesty International, on a case-by-case basis."|1
"Josiah Willard Gibbs ( ; February 11 , 1839 – April 28 , 1903 ) was an American scientist who made important theoretical contributions to physics , chemistry , and mathematics. Nearly a half century after his death, he was hailed as “the greatest American physicist between Henry A.
Wallace and Richard P. Feynman. His scientific work was overshadowed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by that of Wallac eand Albert Einstein, and it has been largely forgotten today. Josiah Willard Gibbs was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of a professor of sacred literature at Yale College, who later became rector of Yale University."|0
Adenine ( symbol A or Ade ) is a nucleobase ( a purine derivative ) . It is one of the four bases found in the nucleic acids of the genetic material ( DNA and RNA ) ; in DNA, the base is cytosine , while in RNA is uracil . It is also a chemical component of ATP, NAD and coenzyme A (in form of AMP). Adenosine ( AMP ) can be derived from ATP hydrolysis through a process called dephosphorylation . Although not an essential nutrient , adenine is converted into purines and nucleotides , which are essential for DNA and RNA biosynthesis in all living cells.|0

The boa knot is a modern binding knot invented by weaver Peter Collingwood in 1996 . His intention was to create a more secure binding knot which can also be tied off neatly with a single half-hitch, rather than the usual two half hitches. Because of the double half hitch at both ends, some people may find that it is not as strong a knot as the usual binding knot. However, as with all binding knots, it should never be subject to any significant force because of the danger of unpicking. If this does happen the boa knot can sometimes be unpicked, but it is a fiddly procedure.|0

In their most common sense , the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of a body and can occur in a mind alone. Thoughts occur in language, and in the minds of thinking persons, they are inextricably associated with linguistic ideas and feelings. They are also closely associated with conscious processes that occur in brains. Thoughts exist independently of the bodies of those who think them, and thinking can happen without bodies and even without brains. The terms thought and thinking can be used to refer to unconscious cognitive processes too, even if this use is not common.|0

National bodies will largely have to be affiliated with international bodies for the same sport.|1
Metaphone is a phonetic algorithm, published by Lawrence Philips in 1990, for indexing words by their English pronunciation. It fundamentally improves on the Soundex algorithm by using information about variations and inconsistencies in English spelling and pronunciation to produce a more accurate encoding, which does a better job of matching words and names which sound similar. As with Soundex, similar-sounding words should share the same keys. Metaphone is available as a built-in operator in a number of systems.Philips later produced a new version of the algorithm, which he named Double Metaphone.|1
Squid are cephalopods in the superorder Decapodiformes with elongated bodies , large eyes , eight arms and two tentacles . Like other members of the superorder Decapodiformes, squid can move freely on the surface of the sea, where they swim rapidly by contracting the large tentacles (which serve to propel water), while their body remains at rest. Some species (the most primitive) lack tentacles and swim by means of fins on their arms, while some are bottom dwellers and swim in an inverted position by moving the head and tentacles from side to side.|0
A seal is a device for making an impression in wax , clay , paper , or some other medium , including an official insignia on documents. The original purpose of a seal was to authenticate a document, a letter, or the signature of the person who issued it.

An inverse multiplexer (often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX) allows a data stream to be broken into multiple lower data rate communication links. An inverse multiplexer differs from a demultiplexer because the multiple output streams from the former stay inter-related, whereas those from the latter are unrelated. An inverse multiplexer is the opposite of a multiplexer  in that it divides one high-speed link into multiple low-speed links, whereas a multiplexer combines multiple low-speed links into one high-speed link.This provides an end to end connection of several times the data rate available on each of the low rate data links.|1

A mass driver or electromagnetic catapult is a proposed method of non-rocket spacelaunch which would use a linear motor to accelerate and catapult payloads up to high speeds. Existing and contemplated mass drivers use coils of wire energized by electricity to make electromagnets, though a rotary mass driver has also been proposed. Sequential firing of a row of electromagnets accelerates the payload along a path. After leaving the path, the payload continues to move due to momentum.Although any device used to propel a ballistic payload is technically a mass driver, in this context a mass driver is essentially a coilgun that magnetically accelerates a package consisting of a magnetizable holder containing a payload.|1
A hot air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft consisting of a bag , called an envelope , which contains heated air. Balloons were first invented in France by a scientist called Montgolfier. Hot air balloon is the world’s first successful flight vehicle. The envelope is made of synthetic fabric called nylon. Hot air balloons stay on the air because of their ability to be lighter than the surrounding air. The basket is usually made out of wicker. Modern hot air balloons have propane gas burners on the bottom which heat the air inside the balloon and allow it to rise.|0
"Brighella ( in Bergamasque dialect : Brighèla ) is a comic , masked character from the Italian theatre style Commedia dell'Arte.

"The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. Specifically, if the positive integer is even, then divide by two. If the positive integer was odd, then multiply by three. Collatz conjecture

## Background

The conjecture is named after Lothar Collatz in his 1937 doctoral thesis. He stated that his thesis proved a conjecture made in 1848 by Rudolf Fueter. In 1985, Paul Erdős claimed to have a proof that the sequence eventually reaches 1. He also claimed to have a proof to the opposite direction."|0
The striatum, or corpus striatum (also called the striate nucleus), is a nucleus (a cluster of neurons) in the subcortical basal ganglia of the forebrain.

"A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura (literally without tail in Ancient Greek). The oldest fossil ""proto-frog"" Triadobatrachus is known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their split from other amphibians may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforest. Frogs account for around 88% of extant amphibian species."|1

Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton 's third law . When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction, there is an equal and opposite force acting in the other direction . This is known as the recoil . Thrust is a concept applicable to linear motion only, and cannot be measured in cases of rotational motion or angular acceleration. In rocket and jet engines, the main source of thrust is high speed ejected fluid, or exhaust. This may be from pressurized gas accelerated through a restricted orifice ( as in a jet engine ) or from ejected propellant mass .|0

A monopropellant rocket ( or `` monochemical rocket '' ) is a rocket that uses a single chemical as its fuel and oxidizer. The simplest examples are solid-fueled chemical rockets. This is in contrast to a multi-stage rocket, which typically carries more than one propellant that is stored in separate tanks. In chemical rockets, the fuel and oxidizer are typically mixed immediately before being burned. For a monopropellant rocket, they are stored in separate tanks or chambers; when burned, the rocket propellant is produced. The advantage of this approach is that the fuels do not react with each other inside the rocket while it is being stored.|0

"In quantum mechanics, counterfactual definiteness (CFD) is the ability to speak ""meaningfully"" of the definiteness of the results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e., the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured). The term ""counterfactual definiteness"" is used in discussions of physics calculations, especially those related to the phenomenon called quantum entanglement and those related to the Bell inequalities. In such discussions ""meaningfully"" means the ability to treat these unmeasured results on an equal footing with measured results in statistical calculations."|1
"Thermonuclear fusion is the process of atoms combining or “fusing” together with huge amounts of heat. There are two forms of thermonuclear fusion: uncontrolled, in which the resulting energy is released in an uncontrolled manner, as it is in thermonuclear weapons (""hydrogen bombs"") and in most stars; and controlled, where the fusion reactions take place in an environment allowing some or all of the energy released to be harnessed for constructive purposes.Temperature requirementsTemperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles, so by heating the material it will gain energy."|1

In their most common sense, the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation. Their most paradigmatic forms are judging, reasoning, concept formation, problem solving, and deliberation. But other mental processes, like considering an idea, memory, or imagination, are also often included. These processes can happen internally independent of the sensory organs, unlike perception. But when understood in the widest sense, any mental event may be understood as a form of thinking, including perception and unconscious mental processes.|1

While a significant majority of water vessels are powered by diesel engines, with sail power and gasoline engines also popular, boats powered by electricity have been used for over 120 years. Electric boats were very popular from the 1880s until the 1920s, when the internal combustion engine became dominant. Since the energy crises of the 1970s, interest in this quiet and potentially renewable marine energy source has been increasing steadily, especially as more efficient solar cells have become available, for the first time making possible motorboats with an infinite range like sailboats. The first practical solar boat was probably constructed in 1975 in England.|1
The Burrows–Wheeler transform ( BWT , also called block-sorting compression ) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters, then counts the characters and stores the lengths in an array. It can also rearrange them into lexicographically sorted order , which allows fast random access. There is no one canonical BWT algorithm: many different algorithms have been proposed, which vary in terms of run length encoding, compression ratio, access times and space usage. BWT is also used as an ingredient in several other algorithms for problems such as document classification , substring indexing and approximate pattern matching .|0

The pancreas is an organ of the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and functions as a gland. The pancreas is a mixed or heterocrine gland, i.e. it has both an endocrine and a digestive exocrine function. 99% of the pancreas is exocrine and 1% is endocrine. As an endocrine gland, it functions mostly to regulate blood sugar levels, secreting the hormones insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide. As a part of the digestive system, it functions as an exocrine gland secreting pancreatic juice into the duodenum through the pancreatic duct.|1
"In chemistry , a nucleophile is a chemical species that forms bonds with electrophiles by donating an electron pair . The term was first used by Otto Paul Werner , who derived it from nucleus ( Latin for ""nuclear"") and ""loving."" Nucleophilicity is therefore the propensity of a reagent to donate a pair of electrons to a Lewis acid. A substance that donates electrons is an electron-pair donor. In general, there is no direct way to measure nucleophilicity, so a variety of measures have been developed to describe relative nucleophilicities. Nucleophiles are usually highly electronegative ."|0

Catalase is a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen ( such as bacteria , plants , and animals ). It is a heme enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of H 2 O 2 into water and oxygen. Thus, it is a crucial enzyme in protecting organisms from hydrogen peroxide , and is the reason for the lack of this gas in aerobic organisms. The reaction proceeds via the hydroxyl radical. In bacterial systems, this radical is produced from molecular oxygen and H2 O2, but in eukaryotic organisms, the enzyme also produces molecular oxygen by removing two hydrogen atoms from a water molecule.|0

The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and most animals including a few fish, and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the air and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing.|1

In mathematics, the Dirac delta distribution ( distribution), also known as the unit impulse symbol, is a generalized function or distribution over the real numbers, whose value is zero everywhere except at zero, and whose integral over the entire real line is equal to one.The current understanding of the impulse is as a linear functional that maps every continuous function to its value at zero, or as the weak limit of a sequence of bump functions, which are zero over most of the real line, with a tall spike at the origin.|1
An ion thruster , ion drive , or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. Instead of the chemical reactions that are the source of energy for a chemical rocket, an ion thruster uses an electrical power source to accelerate ions (charged atoms) to a high speed. Electrostatic and electromagnetic fields cause the charged particles to be forced out of the spacecraft. In some ion thrusters, the electricity is generated by nuclear power or solar panels. These tend to be used on spacecraft that need a lot of power for their other systems as well, such as communications, navigation and scientific equipment.|0

They are mainly soft-bodied, like octopuses, but have a small internal skeleton in the form of a rod-like gladius or pen, made of chitin.Squid diverged from other cephalopods during the Jurassic and occupy a similar role to teleost fish as open water predators of similar size and behaviour. They play an important role in the open water food web.|1
"Genus ( plural genera ) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms as well as viruses in biology. The term comes from the Greek word genei- for ""species"" or ""race"", and was originally defined in contrast to family. Later, the concept was broadened in its meaning. Today, the genus is one of the primary divisions of the scientific classification of living organisms along with the domain, the kingdom, the phylum and the species. Species is a fundamental unit of classification and reproduction with other species."|0

In economics , inflation refers to a general progressive increase in prices of goods and services in an economy . When inflation rises, it leads to a decline in the real value of money, since each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Inflation is thus a significant concern for central banks and governments, as it is generally considered harmful to an economy. Inflation means rising of prices due to increase in demand or outflow of currency. This is a major economic phenomenon. Inflation is measured by price indices. A price index tracks the prices of various goods and services over time.|0

The Hippocratic Oath is an oath of ethics historically taken by physicians. It is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. In its original form, it requires a new physician to swear, by a number of healing gods, to uphold specific ethical standards. The oath is the earliest expression of medical ethics in the Western world, establishing several principles of medical ethics which remain of paramount significance today. These include the principles of medical confidentiality and non-maleficence. As the seminal articulation of certain principles that continue to guide and inform medical practice, the ancient text is of more than historic and symbolic value.|1

Isotope separation is the process of concentrating specific isotopes of a chemical element by removing other isotopes . The use of separation techniques is not unique to chemistry . For example, isotope selection is also important in nuclear power and weapons applications , where uranium is enriched to obtain fuel for reactors or nuclear weapons. These processes all involve isotope separation, using either distillation or chemical exchange of the isotopes of a chemical element from one compound to another, or using selective absorption, catalysis, or adsorption of isotopes. This is a brief review of the history of isotope separation methods and their applications to research and medicine.|0

"Parasports are sports played by people with a disability, including physical and intellectual disabilities. Some parasports are forms of adapted physical activities from existing able-bodied sports, while others have been specifically created for persons with a disability and do not have an able-bodied equivalent. Disability exists in four categories: physical, mental, permanent and temporary. At a competitive level, disability sport classifications are applied to allow people of varying abilities to face similar opposition.EtymologyThe term ""parasports"" arose as a portmanteau of the words paraplegic and sports. Though the sport has since included athletes of disabilities other than paraplegia, the term persists as a catch-all."|1

The covalent radius, rcov, is a measure of the size of an atom that forms part of one covalent bond. It is usually measured either in picometres (pm) or angstroms (Å), with 1 Å = 100 pm.In principle, the sum of the two covalent radii should equal the covalent bond length between two atoms, R(AB) = r(A) + r(B). Moreover, different radii can be introduced for single, double and triple bonds (r1, r2 and r3 below), in a purely operational sense.|1
The oxidation state , or oxidation number , is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds were ionic . The sum of the oxidation states is the formal charge of an atom in a chemical compound (or in a molecule).

Genus  (plural genera ) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms as well as viruses. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.E.g. Panthera leo (lion) and Panthera onca (jaguar) are two species within the genus Panthera. Panthera is a genus within the family Felidae.The composition of a genus is determined by taxonomists. The standards for genus classification are not strictly codified, so different authorities often produce different classifications for genera.|1
"In the philosophy of mathematics, the abstraction of actual infinity involves the acceptance (if the axiom of infinity is included) of infinite entities as given, actual and completed objects. These might include the set of natural numbers, extended real numbers, transfinite numbers, or even an infinite sequence of rational numbers. Actual infinity is to be contrasted with potential infinity, in which a non-terminating process (such as ""add 1 to the previous number"") produces a sequence with no last element, and where each individual result is finite and is achieved in a finite number of steps."|1

A radionuclide (radioactive nuclide, radioisotope or radioactive isotope) is a nuclide that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. This excess energy can be used in one of three ways: emitted from the nucleus as gamma radiation; transferred to one of its electrons to release it as a conversion electron; or used to create and emit a new particle (alpha particle or beta particle) from the nucleus. During those processes, the radionuclide is said to undergo radioactive decay. These emissions are considered ionizing radiation because they are powerful enough to liberate an electron from another atom.|1

Landslides, also known as landslips, are several forms of mass wasting that may include a wide range of ground movements, such as rockfalls, deep-seated slope failures, mudflows, and debris flows. Landslides occur in a variety of environments, characterized by either steep or gentle slope gradients, from mountain ranges to coastal cliffs or even underwater, in which case they are called submarine landslides. Gravity is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur, but there are other factors affecting slope stability that produce specific conditions that make a slope prone to failure.|1
In linguistics, an adjective (abbreviated ) is a word that modifies a noun or noun phrase or describes its referent. Its semantic role is to change information given by the noun.Traditionally, adjectives were considered one of the main parts of speech of the English language, although historically they were classed together with nouns. Nowadays, certain words that usually had been classified as adjectives, including the, this, my, etc., typically are classed separately, as determiners.Some examples: That's an interesting idea. (attributive) That idea is interesting. (predicative)  The good, the bad, and the ugly.|1

A nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) is a type of thermal rocket where the heat from a nuclear reaction, often nuclear fission, replaces the chemical energy of the propellants in a chemical rocket. In an NTR, a working fluid, usually liquid hydrogen, is heated to a high temperature in a nuclear reactor and then expands through a rocket nozzle to create thrust. The external nuclear heat source theoretically allows a higher effective exhaust velocity and is expected to double or triple payload capacity compared to chemical propellants that store energy internally.NTRs have been proposed as a spacecraft propulsion technology, with the earliest ground tests occurring in 1955.|1

In chemistry, a nucleophile is a chemical species that forms bonds with electrophiles by donating an electron pair. All molecules and ions with a free pair of electrons or at least one pi bond can act as nucleophiles. Because nucleophiles donate electrons, they are Lewis bases. Nucleophilic describes the affinity of a nucleophile to bond with positively charged atomic nuclei. Nucleophilicity, sometimes referred to as nucleophile strength, refers to a substance's nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the affinity of atoms. Neutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohols and water are named solvolysis.|1

A political prisoner is someone imprisoned for their political activity . The political offense is not always the official reason for their detention or punishment, as some cases of imprisonment are based on unrelated common crimes or acts of resistance (civil disobedience), or as the result of military tribunals. Political prisoners and prisoners of conscious have historically been subject to persecution, torture and ill treatment, and have often been held in solitary confinement or other harsh conditions. In many countries, political prisoners have a legal recourse and are afforded rights under human rights law, whereas unlawful combatants (guerrillas) are generally not.|0
"In commutative algebra , the prime spectrum ( or simply the spectrum ) of a ring R is the set
Prime spectrum
A prime of R is any ideal of R. If R is an integral domain, then R is a field, so that the prime spectrum of R is the set of prime ideals in the ring of all quotients.

A resistojet is a method of spacecraft propulsion (electric propulsion) that provides thrust by heating a, typically non-reactive, fluid. Heating is usually achieved by sending electricity through a resistor consisting of a hot incandescent filament, with the expanded gas expelled through a conventional nozzle.Resistojets have been flown in space since 1965 on board military Vela satellites. However, they only became used in commercial applications in 1980 with the launch of the first satellites in the INTELSAT-V program. Many GEO spacecraft, and all 95 Iridium, used Aerojet MR-501/MR-502 series resistojet engines.|1
In the English language , the word nigger is an ethnic slur typically used against black people , especially African Americans. It is also used to describe dark-colored persons and objects, regardless of race. Nigger and its cognates have historically been used in various languages to refer to black people; in the 20th century it was increasingly replaced by the word black, which may be used as a general demonym. In many places, the word nigger has become taboo because of the word's long history as an offensive racial slur. Its use is generally considered pejorative and offensive; its usage may be considered socially unacceptable.|0

His election was opposed by King Henry IV, and the resulting conflict was significant in the history of the political control of the papacy and of the church in general. In addition, his reforms, such as promoting the Cluniac monastic reforms in the Roman Church and the reform of the Benedictine Order, caused a great deal of stress to all levels of Catholic Church, which would have a long-lasting effect.|0
The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. It  concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.The conjecture is named after mathematician Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate.|1

The main events typically occur during February or early March, during the period historically known as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent). Carnival typically involves public celebrations, including events such as parades, public street parties and other entertainments, combining some elements of a circus. Elaborate costumes and masks allow people to set aside their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity. Participants often indulge in excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods that will be forgone during upcoming Lent.|1
In economics, inflation refers to a general progressive increase in prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. The opposite of inflation is deflation, a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualised percentage change in a general price index.Prices will not all increase at the same rates. Attaching a representative value to a set of prices is an instance of the index number problem.|1

An inverse multiplexer ( often abbreviated to inverse MUX or IMUX ) allows a data stream to be broken into several separate substreams. An example is a 2×2 matrix that breaks a single stream into two parallel streams, or a 1×4 matrix that breaks a single stream into four parallel streams. In practice, however, the number of input and output streams is typically larger than the number of matrix elements, which allows the data stream to be reassembled into a single stream by adding the outputs back together. An IMUX can be thought of as the inverse of a mux ( multiplexer ).|0

The Alcubierre drive , Alcubierre warp drive , or Alcubierre metric ( referring to metric tensor ) , is a speculative proposal for a method of travelling faster than light based on hypothetical negative energy and a modification of general relativity. The idea was first proposed by Miguel Alcubierre  in 1994. The Alcubierre drive would be a small spacecraft inside a larger spacecraft (the warp bubble), with an exotic type of space-time distortion which would expand space behind the craft and contract the space in front. This expansion would create a region of lowered space time, and an object inside that space would appear to have been transported.|0

A nuclear thermal rocket ( NTR ) is a type of thermal rocket where the heat from a nuclear reaction is used to heat the working fluid and produce the reaction mass exhaust. NTRs use fission or fusion reactions to heat hydrogen or other gas to very high temperature, then expand through a nozzle to generate thrust. The gas is sometimes cooled in a heat exchanger first to maximize the thrust. NTRs operate at temperatures from about 1500 K to 2800 K. This is much higher than any chemical combustion engine, but significantly lower than a nuclear fission rocket or a nuclear fusion rocket.|0

"The Novikov self-consistency principle, also known as the Novikov self-consistency conjecture and Larry Niven's law of conservation of history, is a principle developed by Russian physicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov in the mid-1980s. Novikov intended it to solve the problem of paradoxes in time travel, which is theoretically permitted in certain solutions of general relativity that contain what are known as closed timelike curves. The principle asserts that if an event exists that would cause a paradox or any ""change"" to the past whatsoever, then the probability of that event is zero."|1
"In celestial mechanics, escape velocity or escape speed is the minimum speed needed for a free, non-propelled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a primary body, thus reaching an infinite distance from it. It is typically stated as an ideal speed, ignoring atmospheric friction. Although the term ""escape velocity"" is common, it is more accurately described as a speed than a velocity because it is independent of direction; the escape speed increases with the mass of the primary body and decreases with the distance from the primary body."|1
"The Lhotshampa or Lhotsampa  people are a heterogeneous Bhutanese people of Nepalese descent.

A hybrid-propellant rocket is a rocket with a rocket motor that uses rocket propellants in two different phases: one solid and the other either gas or liquid. The hybrid rocket concept can be traced back to at least the 1930s.Hybrid rockets avoid some of the disadvantages of solid rockets like the dangers of propellant handling, while also avoiding some disadvantages of liquid rockets like their mechanical complexity. Because it is difficult for the fuel and oxidizer to be mixed intimately (being different states of matter), hybrid rockets tend to fail more benignly than liquids or solids.|1

"The oxidation state, or oxidation number, is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to different atoms were fully ionic. It describes the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state may be positive, negative or zero. While fully ionic bonds are not found in nature, many bonds exhibit strong ionicity, making oxidation state a useful predictor of charge.The oxidation state of an atom does not represent the ""real"" formal charge on that atom, or any other actual atomic property."|1

"Emissions trading is a market-based approach to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives for reducing the emissions of pollutants. The concept is also known as cap and trade (CAT) or emissions trading scheme (ETS). Carbon emission trading for  and other greenhouse gases has been introduced in China, the European Union and other countries as a key tool for climate change mitigation. Other schemes include sulfur dioxide and other pollutants.In an emissions trading scheme, a central authority or governmental body allocates or sells a limited number (a ""cap"") of permits that allow a discharge of a specific quantity of a specific pollutant over a set time period."|1

In quantum mechanics , counterfactual definiteness ( CFD ) is the ability to speak `` meaningfully '' of the definiteness of an event whose occurrence is not an actuality . The counterfactual definiteness was initially introduced in a work of A. Fine [1993, 2006, 2007] in a context where there was a lack of a well-defined notion of truth for counterfactual statements. It is the counterfactual counterpart to the notion of the definiteness of an event. In a certain sense it is an extension of the notion of definiteness to the class of counterfactual propositions , and it allows one to `` speak meaningfully '' of them.|0
Fermat 's principle , also known as the principle of least time , is the link between ray optics and electrodynamics. The principle is a statement that light travels in the path that minimizes the time of travel, where that time is an integral of the square of the optical path. It states that the shortest possible time required for light to travel between two points is equal to the time for which the light propagation is not changing with respect to time. The time is minimized if the velocity of light does not vary along the path. This is in accordance with the principle of conservation of energy.|0

"Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are often caught in the wild but may also be caught from stocked bodies of water. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. ""Fishing"" may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate. In addition to being caught to be eaten, fish are caught as recreational pastimes."|1

"Fermat's principle, also known as the principle of least time, is the link between ray optics and wave optics. In its original ""strong"" form, Fermat's principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time. In order to be true in all cases, this statement must be weakened by replacing the ""least"" time with a time that is ""stationary"" with respect to variations of the path — so that a deviation in the path causes, at most, a second-order change in the traversal time."|1

In Euclidean geometry , an affine transformation , or an affinity ( from the Latin , affinis , `` connected with '' ) or affine map , is a map between affine spaces , which preserves the parallelism but may stretch or shear lengths, and in higher dimensions, may rotate. More precisely, it is a composition of translations and dilations . Affine transformations have played a central role in geometry since the 17th century. In modern mathematics, they are the object of study in affine geometry , and are closely related to projective geometry .|0
The Avignon Papacy was the period from 1309 to 1376 during which seven successive popes resided in Avignon ( then in the County of Provence, Kingdom of Arles ), rather than in Rome. In 1303, Pope Boniface VIII was seized by the Colonnas, and the city was placed under interdict by the French King Philip IV. In the following years, a number of cardinals opposed to Philip IV were murdered. French influence over the election of the pope grew apace, and the College of Cardinals at last yielded and elected one of their own, the Frenchman Clément V, as successor to Boniface in 1305.|0

The boa knot is a modern  binding knot invented by weaver Peter Collingwood in 1996. His intention was to develop a knot that would hold well when the constricted object was cut close to the winds of the knot.The boa knot is related to the strangle knot and the double constrictor knot. It combines both the structure and qualities of these other two knots. The boa knot can be very difficult to untie and is inappropriate when frequent or fast untying is needed. The knotted part needs to lie over a convex surface to hold.Start with making two loops that spiral upwards in a clockwise manner.|1

An ion thruster, ion drive, or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. It creates thrust by accelerating ions using electricity.An ion thruster ionizes a neutral gas by extracting some electrons out of atoms, creating a cloud of positive ions. These ion thrusters rely mainly on electrostatics as ions are accelerated by the Coulomb force along an electric field. Temporarily stored electrons are finally reinjected by a neutralizer in the cloud of ions after it has passed through the electrostatic grid, so the gas becomes neutral again and can freely disperse in space without any further electrical interaction with the thruster.|1

In the 1980s , the telecommunications industry expected that digital services would follow much the same pattern as voice services in their penetration and diffusion. But digital services are being deployed much more slowly. There are several reasons. First, there is a natural tendency to keep analog services even when digital services are technically superior because of the familiarity with analog, the ease of using existing equipment, the simplicity of operating procedures, and the fact that there is little risk associated with adopting analog-based services. Second, the digital infrastructure has been in place for a number of years, but few applications have been introduced.|0

It was only available as a targa-topped two-seat roadster powered by either a flat-4 or flat-6 engine.HistoryPre-development By the late 1960s, both Volkswagen and Porsche were in need of new models; Porsche was looking for a replacement for their entry-level 912, and Volkswagen wanted a new range-topping sports coupé to replace the Volkswagen Type 34 Karmann Ghia coupé. At the time the majority of Volkswagen's development work was handled by Porsche as part of an agreement that dated back to Porsche's founding.|1
"The Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT, also called block-sorting compression) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters. This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by techniques such as move-to-front transform and run-length encoding. More importantly, the transformation is reversible, without needing to store any additional data except the position of the first original character. The BWT is thus a ""free"" method of improving the efficiency of text compression algorithms, costing only some extra computation."|1
A complex system is a system composed of many components which may interact with each other.

Emergence means that their common ancestry is not a sufficient basis for explaining how and why they behave the way they do. The butterfly’s wings have evolved to give it flight capability, a property that the wings of the caterpillar do not have.|0

"Isotope separation is the process of concentrating specific isotopes of a chemical element by removing other isotopes. The use of the nuclides produced is varied. The largest variety is used in research (e.g. in chemistry where atoms of ""marker"" nuclide are used to figure out reaction mechanisms). By tonnage, separating natural uranium into enriched uranium and depleted uranium is the largest application. In the following text, mainly the uranium enrichment is considered. This process is crucial in the manufacture of uranium fuel for nuclear power plants, and is also required for the creation of uranium-based nuclear weapons."|1
Garnets  are a group of silicate minerals that have been used since the Bronze Age as gemstones and abrasives.All species of garnets possess similar physical properties and crystal forms, but differ in chemical composition. The different species are pyrope, almandine, spessartine, grossular (varieties of which are hessonite or cinnamon-stone and tsavorite), uvarovite and andradite. The garnets make up two solid solution series: pyrope-almandine-spessartine (pyralspite) and uvarovite-grossular-andradite (ugrandite).EtymologyThe word garnet comes from the 14th-century Middle English word gernet, meaning 'dark red'.

Heliox is a breathing gas mixture of helium (He) and oxygen (O2).Heliox is a medical treatment for patients with difficulty breathing. The mixture generates less resistance than atmospheric air when passing through the airways of the lungs, and thus requires less effort by a patient to breathe in and out of the lungs.Heliox has been used medically since the 1930s, and although the medical community adopted it initially to alleviate symptoms of upper airway obstruction, its range of medical uses has since expanded greatly, mostly because of the low density of the gas.|1
A gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold. The gold standard has historically been a means of storing wealth. Gold coins and bullion have been accepted as payment in many societies. Precious metals are often used as a currency in times of crisis, when inflation is so severe that the purchasing power of official currency has been eroded. The gold standard is an example of a fiat money, although one with a physical commodity backing its face value. The gold reserves establish an upper bound on the money supply.|0
