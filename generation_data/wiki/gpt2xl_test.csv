Hence, a conjugate base is a species formed by the removal of a proton from an acid, as in the reverse reaction it is able to gain a hydrogen ion.|1

In cosmology, the cosmological constant (usually denoted by the Greek capital letter lambda: Λ), alternatively called Einstein's cosmological constant, is the constant coefficient of a term Albert Einstein temporarily added to his field equations of general relativity. He later removed it. Much later it was revived and reinterpreted as the energy density of space, or vacuum energy, that arises in quantum mechanics. It is closely associated with the concept of dark energy.Einstein originally introduced the constant in 1917 to counterbalance the effect of gravity and achieve a static universe, a notion which was the accepted view at the time.|1

A conjugate acid , within the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory , is a chemical compound formed when an acid donates a hydrogen-bonded molecule, usually hydroxide or peroxide, to an acid, usually an amine, such that the double bond between the two species gives rise to the chemical compound. Acid-base conjugation occurs when an acid ion, such as hydrogen ions, dissociates from a hydrogen ion (or other cation) such as peroxide or hydroxyl, forming a hydrogen-bonded molecule. The two molecules join together in an amide, giving rise to two compounds.|0

In genetics, the term genetic inheritance, also known as genetic coding, describes the process by which a gene (i.e., a copy of a specific gene) is passed on from one generation to another from generation to generation. This process is commonly known as genetic inheritance; the word genetic code comes from its scientific definition of the process of inheritance of a set of genes.The term is also used in the field of human genetics and genetics, in reference to inherited information, and sometimes in an informal sense."|0

In mathematics, two sets are said to be disjoint sets if they have no element in common. Equivalently, two disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is the empty set. For example, {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are disjoint sets, while {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5} are not disjoint. A collection of more than two sets is called disjoint if any two distinct sets of the collection are disjoint.GeneralizationsThis definition of disjoint sets can be extended to a family of sets : the family is pairwise disjoint, or mutually disjoint if  whenever .|1

A battering ram is a siege engine that originated in ancient times and was designed to break open the masonry walls of fortifications or splinter their wooden gates. In its simplest form, a battering ram is just a large, heavy log carried by several people and propelled with force against an obstacle; the ram would be sufficient to damage the target if the log were massive enough and/or it were moved quickly enough (that is, if it had enough momentum). Later rams encased the log in an arrow-proof, fire-resistant canopy mounted on wheels. Inside the canopy, the log was swung from suspensory chains or ropes.|1
In metaphysics, extension signifies both 'stretching out' (Latin: extensio) as well as later 'taking up space', and most recently, spreading one's internal mental cognition into the external world.The history of thinking about extension can be traced back at least to Archytas' spear analogy for the infinity of space. How far can one's hand or spear stretch out until it reaches the edge of reality? “If I arrived at the outermost edge of the heaven, could I extend my hand or staff into what is outside or not?|1

Robert Sanderson Mulliken ( June 7 , 1896 – October 31 , 1986 ) was an American physicist and chemist. He is best known for his discovery of deuterium, which forms an isotope in nuclear fission reactions, making the process of nuclear power generation from nuclear waste much less environmentally hazardous than nuclear power generation from the use of fission-fusion reactions. In 1956, he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry with colleagues Walter Gilbert and Harold Urey, and his work with deuterium has since been fundamental to the design of nuclear reactor fuel and power generation methods.Early life and educationIn 1891, at the age of 15, Mulliken's father died.|0
A trisomy is a type of polysomy in which there are three instances of a particular chromosome, instead of the normal two. A trisomy is a type of aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes).Description and causesMost organisms that reproduce sexually have pairs of chromosomes in each cell, with one chromosome inherited from each parent. In such organisms, a process called meiosis creates cells called gametes (eggs or sperm) that have only one set of chromosomes. The number of chromosomes is different for different species. Humans have 46 chromosomes (i.e. 23 pairs of chromosomes).|1

In physics, optical depth or optical thickness is the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant power through a material.Thus, the larger the optical depth, the smaller the amount of transmitted radiant power through the material. Spectral optical depth or spectral optical thickness is the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted spectral radiant power through a material. Optical depth is dimensionless, and in particular is not a length, though it is a  monotonically increasing function of optical path length, and approaches zero as the path length approaches zero.|1

Natural science is one of the branches of science concerned with the description, understanding and prediction of natural phenomena, based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation. Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.Natural science can be divided into two main branches: life science and physical science. Life science is alternatively known as biology, and physical science is subdivided into branches: physics, chemistry, earth science, and astronomy. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields).|1

Optical rotation, also known as polarization rotation or circular birefringence, is the rotation of the orientation of the plane of polarization about the optical axis of linearly polarized light as it travels through certain materials. Circular birefringence and circular dichroism are the manifestations of optical activity. Optical activity occurs only in chiral materials, those lacking microscopic mirror symmetry. Unlike other sources of birefringence which alter a beam's state of polarization, optical activity can be observed in fluids. This can include gases or solutions of chiral molecules such as sugars, molecules with helical secondary structure such as some proteins, and also chiral liquid crystals.|1

Electroporation, or electropermeabilization, is a microbiology technique in which an electrical field is applied to cells in order to increase the permeability of the cell membrane, allowing chemicals, drugs, electrode arrays or DNA to be introduced into the cell (also called electrotransfer).

Observations show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy recedes from the observer is continuously increasing with time.The accelerated expansion was discovered during 1998, by two independent projects, the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-Z Supernova Search Team, which both used distant type Ia supernovae to measure the acceleration. The idea was that as type Ia supernovae have almost the same intrinsic brightness (a standard candle), and since objects that are further away appear dimmer, we can use the observed brightness of these supernovae to measure the distance to them.|1
