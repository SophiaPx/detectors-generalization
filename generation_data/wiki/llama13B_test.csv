Equivalently, a set of points is disjoint from another set of points if the points from the two sets do not coincide, and the same is true for non-empty sets. If each point or set is taken from a universal set, the condition is also referred to as pairwise disjoint sets and is denoted by [1]
If A is any set, then A ∪ ∅=A and ∅=∅. The empty set is always disjoint from every set."|0

Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism, though usually most classify up to homotopy equivalence.Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems, using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible. Algebraic topology, for example, allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a free group is again a free group.Main branches of algebraic topologyBelow are some of the main areas studied in algebraic topology:Homotopy groupsIn mathematics, homotopy groups are used in algebraic topology to classify topological spaces.|1

In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the abstract notion of a limit captures the essential properties of universal constructions such as products, pullbacks and inverse limits. The dual notion of a colimit generalizes constructions such as disjoint unions, direct sums, coproducts, pushouts and direct limits.Limits and colimits, like the strongly related notions of universal properties and adjoint functors, exist at a high level of abstraction. In order to understand them, it is helpful to first study the specific examples these concepts are meant to generalize.Definition Limits and colimits in a category  are defined by means of diagrams in .|1

Dyson's eternal intelligence concept (the Dyson Scenario), proposed by Freeman Dyson in 1979, proposes a means by which an immortal society of intelligent beings in an open universe may escape the prospect of the heat death of the universe by extending subjective time to infinity even though expending only a finite amount of energy.Bremermann's limit can be invoked to deduce that the amount of time to perform a computation on 1 bit is inversely proportional to the change in energy in the system. As a result, the amount of computations that can be performed grows over time.|1

A Tesla coil is an electrical resonant transformer circuit designed by inventor Nikola Tesla in 1891 . It is used to produce high voltage high frequency alternating electricity. The resonant frequency is typically above 120 kHz, and is determined by the primary and secondary inductance and capacitance, as well as the resonant circuit's Q factor, which is a measurement of the circuit's efficiency. The energy stored in the electric and magnetic fields of an oscillating electric circuit, and that is transferred to the oscillation of a load, is known as resonant energy. An experimental Tesla coil.|0
"Bdellovibrio is a genus of Gram-negative, obligate aerobic bacterium. One of the more notable characteristics of this genus is that members can prey upon other Gram-negative bacteria and feed on the biopolymers, e.g. proteins and nucleic acids, of their hosts. They have two lifestyles: a host-dependent, highly mobile phase, the ""attack phase"", in which they form ""bdelloplasts"" in their host bacteria; and a slow-growing, irregularly shaped, host-independent form.Bdellovibrio bacteriovorusThe most well studied of these is Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, which is found almost exclusively in host dependent growth in nature."|1

In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) establishes that, in many situations, when independent random variables are summed up, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a bell curve) even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. The theorem is a key concept in probability theory because it implies that probabilistic and statistical methods that work for normal distributions can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions. This theorem has seen many changes during the formal development of probability theory.|1

Acetic acid bacteria are of high relevance in food fermentations, for example fermented dairy products or vinegar, but also in the wine industry.|0
In cosmology, the cosmological constant (usually denoted by the Greek capital letter lambda: Λ), alternatively called Einstein's cosmological constant, is the constant coefficient of a term Albert Einstein temporarily added to his field equations of general relativity. He later removed it. Much later it was revived and reinterpreted as the energy density of space, or vacuum energy, that arises in quantum mechanics. It is closely associated with the concept of dark energy.Einstein originally introduced the constant in 1917 to counterbalance the effect of gravity and achieve a static universe, a notion which was the accepted view at the time.|1

"In physics, quintessence is a hypothetical form of dark energy, more precisely a scalar field, postulated  as an explanation of the observation  of an accelerating rate of expansion of the universe. The first example of this scenario was proposed by Ratra and Peebles (1988). The concept was expanded to more general types of time-varying dark energy and the term ""quintessence"" was first introduced in a 1998 paper by Robert R. Caldwell, Rahul Dave and Paul Steinhardt. It has been proposed by some physicists to be a fifth fundamental force."|1
"Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the pastime of sliding down snow-covered slopes on skis with fixed-heel bindings, unlike other types of skiing (cross-country, Telemark, or ski jumping), which use skis with free-heel bindings.

The earliest arrival of people in the islands now known as The Bahamas was in the first millennium AD . However, it wasn’t until around 1200 AD that people began to settle the Bahamas as we know them today, as a group known as the Lucayan were the first to make the islands inhabitable. The Lucayans lived mainly along the banks of the many rivers that criss-crossed the islands and it is through the many artifacts left by the group that archeologists have pieced together their way of life. The Bahamas were discovered by European explorers around 1492 and were settled shortly after in 1647 by England.|0

In probability theory , the central limit theorem ( CLT ) establishes that , in many situations , when independent random variables are averaged, their properly normalized sum tends to a normal distribution , regardless of the actual distribution from which they were drawn and of the initial magnitude of their variations. The theorem has many applications in various fields of mathematics , statistics , engineering , and science . The theorem was first published in 1835 by Augustin Louis Cauchy . In his work, Cauchy showed that the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal , provided that the sample size is large enough .|0

In computer programming, a postcondition is a condition or predicate that must always be true just after the execution of some section of code or after an operation in a formal specification. Postconditions are sometimes tested using assertions within the code itself. Often, postconditions are simply included in the documentation of the affected section of code.For example: The result of a factorial is always an integer and greater than or equal to 1.

A conjugate acid, within the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, is a  chemical compound formed when an acid donates a proton (H+) to a base—in other words, it is a base with a hydrogen ion added to it, as in the reverse reaction it loses a hydrogen ion. On the other hand, a conjugate base is what is left over after an acid has donated a proton during a chemical reaction.

In physics , quintessence is a hypothetical form of dark energy , more precisely a scalar field , postulated as a solution to some problems encountered with the standard ΛCDM model , particularly with its assumption that the universe is spatially flat in which the density of matter varies slowly with time . In a theory where dark energy density varies by orders of magnitude, the universe should have either expanded more quickly in the past and slowed down more dramatically now, or else accelerated more rapidly in recent times. If matter density varies with time, the expansion rate of the universe could also change by a factor of a thousand.|0

"The Stoned Guest is a ""half-act opera"" by Peter Schickele in the satirical persona of P. D. Q. Bach. The title is a play on the ""stone guest"" character in Don Giovanni by Mozart, as well as the opera The Stone Guest by Alexander Sergeyevich Dargomïzhsky after the play by Pushkin. The work is a parody of classical opera, although some critics consider it to be the equal of many classical works in technical ability. The opera appears on the 1970 album of the same name.The loose story combines elements of Don Giovanni with elements of Carmen by Georges Bizet."|1
Observations show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy is receding today is larger than the velocity of the same galaxy 10 billion years ago. This fact poses a major problem in modern cosmology, since it cannot be accommodated by the laws of gravity that are observed in the Solar System. The expansion of our universe cannot be understood using Einstein’s General Relativity as the theory has to be modified to include a repulsive force and a new form of dark matter or dark energy.|0

"In mathematics , open sets are a generalization of open intervals in the real line . In a metric space—that is, a space that has a notion of distance—an open set is simply a set for which every pair of points has a distance between them. In topological spaces and vector spaces, there are stronger conditions for a set to be an open set. For open sets in algebra, see Open subset. Open sets are an example of a topology. ## Definition

In the real numbers, every open interval of the form (a,b) is an open set."|0
In computational complexity theory , PSPACE is the set of all decision problems that can be solved by a Turing machine using space polynomial in the input size and random access memory polynomial in the number of possible solutions. In the context of Turing machines with an unbounded tape , PSPACE is the set of decision problems solvable by a Turing machine that has unbounded read-only storage, and write-only storage bounded by a polynomial function of the size of the tape (whereas the tape may be infinitely long). The term PSPACE is an acronym for Polynomial-sized Space , but it has become so common that its expansion is not needed.|0
Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is a neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and related species. It prevents the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from axon endings at the neuromuscular junction, thus causing flaccid paralysis. The toxin causes the disease botulism. The toxin is also used commercially for medical and cosmetic purposes.The seven main types of botulinum toxin are named types A to G (A, B, C1, C2, D, E, F and G). New types are occasionally found. Types A and B are capable of causing disease in humans, and are also used commercially and medically.|1

In category theory , a branch of mathematics , the abstract notion of a limit captures the essential properties of the limit point of a sequence or net . A limit point may be defined for any infinite set of points. The most common definition of the limit point is in terms of convergence . If the sequence or net is converging to some point , the points which are converging to the limit point from the right and the limit point itself can be called its limit points. In this way one can define two kinds of limits on a sequence or net of points in a topological space .|0

Photomontage is the process and the result of making a composite photograph by cutting , gluing , rearranging and overlapping images, either to produce new meanings or to mock or criticize the photographic depictions of the world. Today, the term is generally used for a two-dimensional work of art combining photographs, drawings, letters, or other elements and objects, but the term in its original sense can also be applied to photomontage works constructed using only photographs. Typically such works are seen as less serious, more decorative and less innovative works of art than those produced by straight photography.|0

Tone is the use of pitch in language to distinguish lexical or grammatical meaning – that is, to distinguish or to inflect words. All verbal languages use pitch to express emotional and other paralinguistic information and to convey emphasis, contrast and other such features in what is called intonation, but not all languages use tones to distinguish words or their inflections, analogously to consonants and vowels. Languages that have this feature are called tonal languages; the distinctive tone patterns of such a language are sometimes called tonemes, by analogy with phoneme.|1

"Symbiosis (from Greek , , ""living together"", from , , ""together"", and , bíōsis, ""living"") is any type of a close and long-term biological interaction between two different biological organisms, be it mutualistic, commensalistic, or parasitic. The organisms, each termed a symbiont, must be of different species. In 1879, Heinrich Anton de Bary defined it as ""the living together of unlike organisms"". The term was subject to a century-long debate about whether it should specifically denote mutualism, as in lichens."|1
