Nature versus nurture is a long-standing debate in biology about the balance between two competing factors which determine fate :  inherited (inborn, genetic ) or environmental. Today, many researchers agree that both genetic and environmental factors play a part in who we are and that none alone determine our identity and capability. Nature gives us potential, the traits we can use or develop. Nurture, which includes life experiences and the environment, shapes our expression and activation of that potential. Nature and nurture must exist in a balanced proportion and vary among different characteristics and even populations.|0

The equilibrium vapor pressure is an indication of a liquid's evaporation rate. It relates to the tendency of particles to escape from the liquid (or a solid). A substance with a high vapor pressure at normal temperatures is often referred to as volatile. The pressure exhibited by vapor present above a liquid surface is known as vapor pressure.|1
In mathematics, open sets are a generalization of  open intervals in the real line. In a metric space—that is, when a distance function is defined—open sets are the sets that, with every point , contain all points that are sufficiently near to  (that is, all points whose distance to  is less than some value depending on ).More generally, one defines open sets as the members of a given collection of subsets of a given set, a collection that has the property of containing every union of its members, every finite intersection of its members, the empty set, and the whole set itself.|1
"In probability theory , the central limit theorem ( CLT ) establishes that , in many situations , when independent  random variables are added

the laws of chance as seen in large samples are nearly the same as what we see in the population at large. It is a vital concept that is applicable in many scenarios involving mathematical statistics, statistical inference, or operations research. The central limit theorem is one of the most widely used results in probability theory due to its practicality. In the scenarios when its assumptions are applicable, the central limit theorem offers simple answers to complex statistical questions."|0

Electroporation , or electropermeabilization , is a microbiology technique in which an electrical field is applied to cells in order  to increase their permeability to certain molecules. The field used to affect cell permeability consists of very short electrical pulses with a duration between a millisecond and a few milliseconds. These pulses are capable of producing a permeabilization in a membrane that would otherwise not be achieved through physiochemical methods. Additionally, electroporation increases the speed at which DNA enters cells by nearly a millionfold and increases protein uptake significantly. It is therefore used to rapidly transfer molecules such as DNA, mRNA and proteins into both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.|0
A battering ram is a siege engine that originated in ancient times and was designed to break open the masonry walls of fortifications or splinter their wooden gates.

A conjugate acid, within the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, is a  chemical compound formed when an acid donates a proton (H+) to a base—in other words, it is a base with a hydrogen ion added to it, as in the reverse reaction it loses a hydrogen ion. On the other hand, a conjugate base is what is left over after an acid has donated a proton during a chemical reaction. Hence, a conjugate base is a species formed by the removal of a proton from an acid, as in the reverse reaction it is able to gain a hydrogen ion.|1

Gravity , or gravitation , is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy , including planets  , stars , galaxies, and even light , are brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another. Gravity has an infinite range, but it becomes progressively weaker on farther objects. Scientists believe that it is an inherent property of space that became stronger over time as matter dispersed itself more evenly throughout the universe. Today, the forces of gravity bind together the planets and other celestial bodies in the Solar System, stars and galaxies.|0
"In mathematics , two sets are said to be disjoint sets if they have no element in common . Equivalently , disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is the empty set

This means that each element of one set does not exist in the other and thus any member from one set does not also belong to the other set. There is no overlap between the two sets and each set only contains elements from their set and no elements from the other set. Disjoint sets can be helpful when evaluating two or more distinct groups or for cases when there are several events or ideas which have nothing in common."|0

"A noble savage is a literary stock character who embodies the concept of the indigene, outsider, wild human, an ""other"" who has not been ""corrupted"" by civilization, and therefore symbolizes humanity's innate goodness. Besides appearing in many works of fiction and philosophy, the stereotype was also heavily employed in early anthropological works.In English, the phrase first appeared in the 17th century in John Dryden's heroic play The Conquest of Granada (1672), wherein it was used in reference to newly created man. ""Savage"" at that time could mean ""wild beast"" as well as ""wild man""."|1

"Observations show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy  moves away from us

This acceleration suggests that the universe contains more energy than can be observed directly. Dark energy is believed to be responsible for this energy, pushing galaxies away from us at an ever faster pace. Recent estimates put the energy density of dark energy at around 70% of the total energy density of the universe. This shows just how little we know about the physical properties of dark energy, making its continued observation crucial."|0

Acetic acid bacteria ( AAB ) are a group of Gram-negative bacteria which oxidize sugars or ethanol and produce acetic  acid. They are important for food processing and preserving industries, as well as for winemaking, and the production of vinegar. AAB can play an important role in producing flavour components. Many aromatic and phenolic compounds are created through their action and often contribute greatly to a final product's quality. In particular, certain phenolic components and those generated through decarboxylations or lactone ring formation can be traceable directly back to the role played by AAB.|0
"Optical rotation , also known as polarization rotation or circular birefringence , is the rotation of the orientation of the  plane of polarization of plane-polarized light as it passes through certain materials

This occurs because the molecules within certain materials have the ability to exert torque on the plane of light, changing its original orientation. Optical activity can vary in magnitude from less than a fraction of a degree to thousands of degrees per metre, depending on the type of material. Polarimetry has allowed us to explore and exploit the optical rotation phenomenon and obtain detailed structural information of various optically active compounds."|0

In metaphysics , extension signifies both 'stretching out ' ( Latin : extensio ) as well as later 'taking up  room '. The concept of extension has evolved with advancements in science and modern theories of philosophy. Scientists analyze what happens when things stretch, or are pulled outward or enlarge, then adjust the measurement accordingly. They might observe changes in physical reality with, for example, geometrical precision. Philosophers look for patterns in experience of such an extension with theories of psychology, perceiving these dimensions of reality in thought and experience as if within an abstraction and asking questions about whether reality indeed does change accordingly.|0

Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism, though usually most classify up to homotopy equivalence.Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems, using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible. Algebraic topology, for example, allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a free group is again a free group.Main branches of algebraic topologyBelow are some of the main areas studied in algebraic topology:Homotopy groupsIn mathematics, homotopy groups are used in algebraic topology to classify topological spaces.|1

"Uracil ( symbol U or Ura ) is one of the four nucleobases in the nucleic acid RNA that are  represented by the letters G, C, A and U. 

Uracil has an essential role in the biochemistry of organisms as part of RNA. When adenine and guanine (A and G) bond to each other they form the pair AG and U forms with cytosine to form the complementary pair CG. DNA replicates itself with RNA which reads the DNA code and pairs complementary nucleotide in A-T and C-G pairs, converting this information into a code and building the correct proteins."|0

In computational complexity theory , PSPACE is the set of all decision problems that can be solved by a Turing  machine using a polynomial amount of space. It can be used as the polynomial space for the decidability and validity of deterministic algorithms that compute a result depending on the problem specification. In order to decide whether or not a problem is solvable using PSPACE, we must determine whether it is a polynomial-time computable function. PSPACE is one of the fundamental classes of decision problems with both the DTIME and PTIME problems subsuming the PSPACE.|0
In mathematics, two sets are said to be disjoint sets if they have no element in common. Equivalently, two disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is the empty set. For example, {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are disjoint sets, while {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5} are not disjoint. A collection of more than two sets is called disjoint if any two distinct sets of the collection are disjoint.GeneralizationsThis definition of disjoint sets can be extended to a family of sets : the family is pairwise disjoint, or mutually disjoint if  whenever .|1

Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces . The basic  idea of algebraic topology is to use algebra to provide a means of extracting global information from these spaces. Through the use of this methodology, topological objects can be studied in great detail by characterizing its features that otherwise would be impossible to capture using traditional point-set topological methods. Algebraic topology is heavily used in fields such as engineering, graph theory and machine learning. Additionally, its concepts are being increasingly used in more physics-based areas of research such as applied condensed matter, topological insulators, etc.|0

In geometry , two figures or objects are congruent if they have the same shape and size , or if  one has the same shape and size as the mirror image of the other. They need to have the exact same measurements from corner to corner, side to side and point to point, regardless of what size that may be. Congruent shapes must have equal lengths for every corresponding side and angle measurement, just like similar shapes do. Every single aspect of congruent figures should align with one another perfectly, because if not then they simply cannot be said to be congruent.|0

"Bdellovibrio is a genus of Gram-negative, obligate aerobic bacterium. One of the more notable characteristics of this genus is that members can prey upon other Gram-negative bacteria and feed on the biopolymers, e.g. proteins and nucleic acids, of their hosts. They have two lifestyles: a host-dependent, highly mobile phase, the ""attack phase"", in which they form ""bdelloplasts"" in their host bacteria; and a slow-growing, irregularly shaped, host-independent form.Bdellovibrio bacteriovorusThe most well studied of these is Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, which is found almost exclusively in host dependent growth in nature."|1

Observations show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy recedes from the observer is continuously increasing with time.The accelerated expansion was discovered during 1998, by two independent projects, the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-Z Supernova Search Team, which both used distant type Ia supernovae to measure the acceleration. The idea was that as type Ia supernovae have almost the same intrinsic brightness (a standard candle), and since objects that are further away appear dimmer, we can use the observed brightness of these supernovae to measure the distance to them.|1
"Year 1212 ( MCCXII ) was a leap year starting on Sunday ( link will display the full calendar ) 

The month of December in the year 1212 had 31 days with the 28th being a Sunday.

"A finite difference is a mathematical expression of the form . If a finite difference is divided by , one  obtains a difference quotient

This difference quotient is also called a derivative. Derivatives measure the instantaneous rate of change of a given expression with respect to its independent variable, for example x. With finite differences, this measure of change is represented through discrete steps. Finite differences are therefore well-suited to systems where change happens incrementally over time, instead of a continuous rate. It has many applications in calculus, calculus of variations and numerical analysis."|0
In computer programming, a postcondition is a condition or predicate that must always be true just after the execution of some section of code or after an operation in a formal specification. Postconditions are sometimes tested using assertions within the code itself. Often, postconditions are simply included in the documentation of the affected section of code.For example: The result of a factorial is always an integer and greater than or equal to 1. So a program that calculates the factorial of an input number would have postconditions that the result after the calculation be an integer and that it be greater than or equal to 1.|1

"In physics , optical depth or optical thickness is the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant  flux

The measure of optical depth quantifies the fraction of the power (amount) of a beam of electromagnetic radiation that is transferred through a matter and reduced by successive absorptions and scatterings due to attenuation in a given path length of matter. By measuring the incident flux and subtracting the observed flux, we can then calculate the attenuation of radiant power by use of the optical depth, providing scientists and researchers an important tool to analyze the processes by which materials, environments and different depths interact and function in nature."|0
