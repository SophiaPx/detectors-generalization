SUT-PJ/CJ series tuner modules TOKYO—Sony Corp. announced commercialization of a demodulator and tuner set for 4K- and 8K-capable satellite TV broadcasts. The tuner is modeled on those that Sony had launched in the United States in 2005, with a built-in video amplifier capable of producing 4K (720p) signal streams at 60 frames per second. The tuner's main function is to convert the signal to high-speed HDMI or standard digital displays. In addition, an LCD screen connected to the tuner allows users to adjust the sound quality to suit the content. The company said it expects commercialization of this technology by 2018.|0
Briefly: Each time we get the chance to pass along a bit of info about Christopher Nolan‘s next film, Interstellar, it is typically just a name, as the details of the sci-fi script are being kept quiet. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and Jessica Chastain are in the cast, for example, but we can’t tell you much about any of their characters. We know that Nolan’s long-time cinematographer Wally Pfister won’t shoot the film, due to his directorial commitment on Transcendence, but that Hoyte Van Hoytema (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) will reportedly shoot instead.|1
- Are these the phones Samsung plans to announce? We're two days into 2018 and already the new year is treating us well. Samsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S9 and S9+ in early 2018, so, of course, the leaks are coming full force, starting with renders from this morning, and, now, the first hands-on image of the two handsets. The leak (below), spotted by Androidandme, was shared to the Chinese site Weibo, and it shows the backside of the Galaxy S9 and S9+. Although it looks legit, nothing has been confirmed by Samsung.|1
Cristiano Ronaldo, 33, leads the competition's scoring charts for a remarkable fifth year in a row and is fourth overall behind Lionel Messi and Neymar. In the last two years, there has been an uptick in interest in blockchain technology from many areas of the banking industry. Some believe it will change the financial landscape in a way that could potentially affect the economy as we know it today. There are also companies like Eureka who are using the technology to power their smart contracts and other innovative applications. Here are the most important features of blockchain technology and where they should be considered.|0
The movement is a global phenomenon – but here it has stalled before even getting started. RIDESHARING SERVICES WHICH supporters claim could spare Irish cities from gridlock are being effectively locked out of the country on the grounds of breaking taxi laws. Transport officials have recently questioned one of the industry’s newest entrants, a carpooling app backed by entrepreneur and Dragon’s Den investor Sean O’Sullivan, on how it fits within rules that have already seen similar operators abandon the market. But Cork-based startup Carma Carpooling claims it is only promoting the kind of ridesharing setups neighbours and colleagues have been doing for decades.|1
Over the next few months, many federal employees will receive performance ratings. Some may believe their ratings to be more important because they have greater responsibility and less flexibility. Others say they should not be put into that category, even if they can still perform at the highest level. But for those who feel they don't matter as much as others in a workplace environment, what does that mean for you? It is one of the world's biggest technology conferences, showcasing the latest advances in computing and virtualisation technology.|0
The proposal that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to stem migration is nothing but 'hipster'colonialism. Last month, President Trump signed a bill requiring all U.S. officials to report and share information on people who seek asylum in the U.S. The new executive order does not apply to those coming directly from countries targeted by terror groups. We may need to get even bolder than what some are calling for. According to an independent report issued today, the United States must be more aggressive in reducing our reliance on oil if we want to meet our 2020 climate change goals.|0
"In part two of her revealing new ET interview, Paula Deen opens up to Nancy O'Dell about overcoming the crippling panic disorder agoraphobia, which she says triggered so much fear that it kept her from leaving her home for weeks at a time. ""I would have panic attacks and my arms would go numb and you feel like you're having a heart attack,"" Paula tells Nancy about symptoms of the anxiety disease during an interview at her sprawling Savannah, GA estate.

ROCHESTER – Nathan Bastian scored the game-winning goal as the Binghamton Devils defeated the Rochester Americans in overtime, 4-3 on Wednesday, ending a three-game road trip that had started well and ended with their third straight loss. Rice University is investigating what caused an early-morning crash Saturday in which a truck driver crashed his car and killed one person and injured seven other people. The incident happened about 5:20 a.m. at the corner of State Road 902 and Main Street, just south of the city limits of St. John's. The driver of the Toyota Prius was driving northbound when he collided with another vehicle traveling northbound, police said.|0
When I opened the brown clasp envelope and pulled out the 21-page spiral book, I was startled. Dr. Jones is not a pianist. I’ve been having a good laugh at myself about it these last few weeks. (I guess I really do need hearing aids.) I told the story when I spoke to the Barrington Hall Garden Club last week, and the ladies got a chuckle out of it. Dr. Jones is passionate about peonies. At one time, he had 120 peony plants blooming in the backyard of his former home on Hillandale Circle.|1
Boeing’s latest setback, a deal between Tesla and Fiat Chrysler, and Pinterest’s valuation were in focus as markets geared up for another week on Monday. The venerable British ultrapremium car maker saw its stock hammered after its October public listing. Now with solid management and new models, its stock should accelerate. Ferrari NV RACE Tuesday raised its dividend for the year by 45%. The Italian car maker proposed a dividend of 1.03 euros ($1.17) a share for 2018, up from EUR0.71 for 2017. Ferrari said this is equivalent to a total payout of about EUR194 million.|1
"The battle over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ’ s new “ borrower education tool ” unveiled earlier this week is heating up. On Monday, the Senate voted to approve a resolution supporting a $100 billion package of relief for families hit hard by the recent financial crisis. If approved by the House and signed into law, it will send a clear message to Wall Street banks and their partners that they shouldn't continue to play the ""too big to bail out"" card at taxpayer expense — especially when it comes to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau."|0
A Dallas County jury found Jesus Trevino, 33, guilty of capital murder Monday in the death of 37-year-old Laura Grillo. He will not have the possibility of parole. The boy admitted to sending the threats via Snapchat on Tuesday and was charged with misdemeanor threat to use firearms, police spokesman David Nabors said. The city says an 8-acre crystal lagoon, a show fountain and trolleys are essential to the plan at Bayside. The developer has said the original proposal is no longer feasible. Trains and buses will operate on a Sunday schedule on Tuesday and Jan. 1.|1
The Volstead Act was repealed on this date in 1933, returning control of alcohol to the states, and allowing consumers to sell their alcohol at the local liquor stores. This was a revolutionary time for alcohol law reform – it ended centuries of failed prohibition efforts, opened up access to an entire new class of people who never would have otherwise been able to drink, and brought about major improvements in quality of life for all Americans. The repeal of the Volstead Act was so significant that it could be cited as a defining moment in modern history.|0
ASTANA, Kazakhstan—Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s first and only president, resigned on Tuesday, ending his nearly 30-year reign and setting the stage for an opaque succession process in the oil-rich Central Asian country of 18 million people. As his speech hinted, Nazarbayev’s departure from office will not mean giving up the reins of power. The aging leader, who has led Kazakhstan since 1989, when it was still part of the Soviet Union, said that Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the speaker of the Senate and a trusted political ally of Nazarbayev, will take over as acting president until new elections are held in 2020.|1
WINNIPEG — Turning trash into treasure is somewhat of an art form, but the new season of a HGTV reality show will tackle that head-on with some expert help. Produced by Canadian film company Frantic Films, “Buy It, Fix It, Sell It” follows a cast of refurbishing professionals bidding on second-hand items at auctions in Winnipeg and Toronto, only to turn them into designer or collector items and sell them to see who can make the biggest profit. Mike Wolchock, and his brother Joe, are known as the Neon Brothers on the show.|1
"Sanday, a Scottish island inhabited by only six people, has just got its first road – an unpaved 1.5-mile track that locals says will ""transform"" their lives. Many of Scotland's 790 islands are still impossibly remote – and beautiful. Here are some of Telegraph Travel's favourites. Sanday has a big sister. Neighbouring Canna, to which it is linked by a bridge. But it isn't much bigger. The most westerly of the Small Isles archipelago, Canna's population is just 12 - or one per square kilometre."|1
Gotham is dealing a familiar Joker in Season 2. Seemingly confirming what the Fox drama’s showrunner Bruno Heller shared with TVLine, Season 1 guest star Cameron Monaghan (Shameless) posted to Instagram a “police lineup” picture of him back in jocular Jerome mode. Gotham opens Season 2 on Monday, Sept. 21, where it now leads into the freshman drama Minority Report. * Homeland Season 5 has cast Ukrainian actor Mark Ivanir (Royal Pains) in the recurring role of Ivan Krupin, Saul’s intelligence counterpart in the SVR, THR reports.|1
Why do we only hear about Jasper Johns when he gets ripped off? Jasper Johns is the greatest artist alive. It seems a shame that he only enters the headlines when people rip him off. Johns was in court this week to give evidence against a Queens, New York foundry owner, Brian Ramnarine, who has now pleaded guilty to faking one of the artist's works. It was a bronze version of one of the most iconic of all American paintings: Flag. Johns had made four bronze copies of Flag in 1960 at Ramnarine's foundry.|1
WASHINGTON — Thousands of commuters across the region were delayed Thursday morning by an apparent work action by Metro ’s maintenance contractor, which shut down trains for an hour while crews worked to repair damage at tracks that link Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington. No injuries have been reported, and Metro said in a news release it is working to reroute rail traffic to other lines. Metro spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the problem began around 8:30 a.m. when a man noticed a train pulling in front of him along Pennsylvania Avenue Northeast near Constitution Avenue.|0
Let’s dispense with the question of whether Democrat Ralph Northam is being treated unfairly. His grievous political wounds — by Monday, virtually all Democratic Party luminaries in the state and most Democratic presidential hopefuls had called on him to resign — are self-inflicted. When the photograph from Northam’s Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook surfaced Friday, his first reaction was to issue a statement of abject apology. Tactically, in terms of crisis management, that was the right move — own the transgression and say unambiguously that you’re sorry.|1
"MANILA, Philippines — House Majority Leader Rolando Andaya Jr. will yield his position to Capiz 2nd District Rep. Fredenil Reyes, according to sources. The decision was made after negotiations between the two lawmakers and Senator Grace Poe came to an abrupt halt Tuesday morning when the latter announced her intention to retire. Reyes had called Andaya's move ""inconceivable"" but agreed to give him more than 50 percent of his vote share in order to preserve the Senate seat, sources said. The US Congress has voted on Thursday to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, putting it on track for approval this summer before President Obama leaves office."|0

To any objective observer, the consensus that exists between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the fundamental issues of war and peace, Wall Street’s dominance of American life, and fiscal austerity, has been made crystal clear in the two “debates.” In the absence of effective popular resistance to the duopoly of money, the economic and social crisis fails to create a corresponding political crisis for the rulers. As a result, there is nothing important for them to debate. The two titans of America’s finance capitalist duopoly clashed – leaving behind a dull fart.|1

So far this year, the group’s main grocery brands have delivered a 4.1 per cent sales increase, boosted by marketing campaigns including the launch of Mr Kipling ‘Great British Fancies’ for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.|1

AUSTIN — Rep. Rafael Anchia filed a resolution Monday condemning President Donald Trump's executive order restricting travel to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The measure was sponsored by Rep. David Valadao, D-San Antonio and House Majority Leader John Boehner, R-Wichita. The U.S. government is facing its most serious cybersecurity crisis in a quarter century as hundreds of thousands of private computers are being infected with malware or otherwise compromised. Cybersecurity officials say hackers have taken advantage of weaknesses that can be found in commercial and government infrastructure across the country, including on military bases, airports and power plants.|0
The “digital workforce” may sound like science fiction, conjuring up images of lines of robots running through an office. In truth, the digital workforce is a tangible reality. But, rather than teams of robots, it involves a more promising environment with people, automation, and artificial intelligence working side by side. This hybrid workforce is coming to life thanks to businesses that recognize the transformative potential in automation and AI. In a study by Genpact of 300 C-suite and senior executives, 79% of AI leaders – the companies generating impact from AI – expect their employees to be comfortable working alongside robots by 2020.|1
TOPEKA (AP) - A bill that would rescind restrictions on the development of private property near historical sites has been approved by the Kansas Senate, despite pleas from preservationists to delay the vote. The bill approved Wednesday repeals state restrictions on the development or renovation of buildings within 500 feet of a historical building in a city, or 1,000 feet around sites in unincorporated areas. It now goes to the House for a vote. Currently, property owners must notify the state Historic Preservation Office in advance if they want to substantially alter properties near a building that's on the state or national Register of Historic Places.|1

Hi, National Geographic, it's me, Ryan. I got your package today and I guess I'm wondering - why did you send me a pseudoscientific crystal healing water bottle with your name on it? National Geographic, usually known for photos of animals and the adventures of rich people visiting other countries, is premiering their Will Smith-narrated, Darren Aronofsky-produced series, One Strange Rock, on March 26.

New Jersey hits day three of its government shutdown Monday over a budget stalemate that's closed state parks — and will likely force the furlough of 35,000 workers. On Sunday, the impasse even inconvenienced Gov. Chris Christie, forcing him to leave a state beach that was on shutdown to the public — but open to his family — because he had to return to Trenton. All nonessential services remained closed as the Republican governor and the Democratic Assembly speaker continued to disagree over Christie's plan for a nonprofit health system that is at the center of the budget dispute.|1

Under Trump, presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor. Since discovering the president would pardon John W. Hinckley Jr., who had been charged with attempted murder in the June 1998 bombing of a federal building, Bill Clinton has repeatedly said he wanted President Trump to do just that—a pardon. It is no exaggeration to say that it's impossible to imagine an era more fraught with racial tension and conflict than the one under Donald Trump. In fact, if anything, it could be more like the time when the United States faced the Civil War.|0

Many Alberta small-business owners, who have been struggling through a prolonged economic downturn, are hoping the next provincial government will bring relief through business-friendly policies. The Alberta election is April 16 and polls suggest that Rachel Notley’s ruling New Democrats will be replaced with Jason Kenney’s United Conservatives, which have campaigned to scrap the carbon tax and loosen some labour rules that have driven up business costs. Over the past two years, small-business confidence in Alberta has reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the country, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which has been tracking the measure for about 20 years.|1
Where do we begin to try to describe this restaurant? Probably the best place is first to apologize for the poor quality of pictures. The food was good, but the customer service was terrible. There is no guarantee they'll take you in again. One thing that I have noticed over the last couple of years or so has been a general inability to connect with my peers when meeting new people. I'm pretty sure I speak to a lot of other young people because I meet lots of them on Twitter, Facebook and other social media (which I really love).|0
America is voting Tuesday to fill the country's top job opening. The country also has over five million other jobs waiting for the right candidate. The Labor Department said Tuesday that America had 5.5 million job openings in September, close to the record high of 5.8 million openings set in April. There was even a small increase in federal government job openings. It's a great sign that employers want to hire. However, this huge number of openings also signals that employers can't find the workers with the right skills for the open jobs that they have.|1

Throwing knives at your HSC project and then dunking it in the pool isn't the usual way of checking whether you can build something.

The Jewish-American advocacy group J Street, which bills itself as the dovish alternative to the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) lobby, has secretly received funding from billionaire George Soros despite previous denials that it accepted funds from the Hungarian-born financier and liberal political activist. Tax forms obtained by The Washington Times reveal that Mr. Soros and his two children, Jonathan and Andrea Soros, contributed a total $245,000 to J Street from one Manhattan address in New York during the fiscal year from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009.|1
One of the biggest highlights of Valve's Greenlight process for games awaiting their arrival on Steam, is that we get to report on all sorts of wacky, original, unique and artistic games that we otherwise never would have encountered without the system. One of those games happens to be the 16-bit'ish Anodyne, which is a nice mix of top-down RPG adventuring and hack-and-slash gameplay. Designed by two dudes, Sean “Seagaia” Hogan and his friend Jon Kittaka, Anodyne pits players against monsters, traps and pixelated puzzles. The game takes place in a fantasy dream world of the young protagonist named Young.|1
SHAH ALAM (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - The High Court in Shah Alam has rejected a bid to block the relocation of the Seafield Sri Maha Mariamman Temple in USJ 25 that was at the centre of riots earlier this week. Three individuals acting as the administrators of the temple filed an application at the Shah Alam High Court on Thursday (Nov 29) to strike out the eviction order. However, the High Court dismissed the injunction against a 2014 consent judgment ordering the temple to be relocated. Lawyer S. Morgan, representing plaintiff Thangaraju Sundarajoo, told reporters that the court refused to allow the temple to stay.|1
Other events add to the excitement. They, too, are a lot of work. But they add to it in new and intriguing ways that can make it feel more than just fun. You might notice that these events are different than the ones you're normally used to seeing, or even at your place of employment. It doesn't mean you can't enjoy them (although it certainly won't be something you do all the time), but there will come a moment when you start to wonder how you could possibly have ever planned on doing it.|0
The Toronto real estate market is showing signs of stirring from its deep freeze, with new listings starting to pick up — and an almost 8 per cent spike in prices — as of mid February, year over year, according to figures released Wednesday. Some 2,767 properties were sold during the first two weeks of February, up just 1.3 per cent from the same period a year ago, says the Toronto Real Estate Board. But the average sale price was up 7.8 per cent to $547,107 from the $507,474 recorded in the first two weeks of February 2013.|1
"Police in Itami, Hyogo Prefecture, said Monday they have arrested an unemployed 45-year-old woman on suspicion of fraud after she made false complaints to many businesses in order to get compensation from them. According to police, Tomoko Onotani called a pastry shop in Toyonaka City, Osaka Prefecture, in May and told them there was hair in a cake she bought from the store, Sankei Shimbun reported. An employee of the store went to a parking lot near her residence and gave her a cake as ""compensation."" Police said Onotani used the same trick to defraud a bakery in Kobe City of 1,085 yen in June."|1
In a democracy, it is said, we get the government we deserve. The same can be said of our electoral process, where every vote matters. There are a great deal of factors at play and no single factor is going to be responsible for why we have the current political climate in the U.S. or in any country. That said, here are some things you should not expect from an election. A former high-ranking aide to President Donald Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn was charged Friday with lying to federal authorities over communications he had with a Russian official prior to joining his White House role.|0
ARSENE WENGER last night confessed he passed up the chance to buy Didier Drogba – for just £100,000! The Arsenal boss could have landed the super striker seven years ago, while he was playing for lowly French outfit Le Mans in the French Second Division. But Wenger stressed he was not the only manager to snub a player who went on to join today’s FA Cup semi-final opponents Chelsea for £24m two years later. “Don’t forget all the French clubs watched him,” he pointed out. “Nobody took him. He went from Le Mans to Guingamp.|1
Under construction at 664 North Michigan Avenue, the former site of the Terra Museum of American Art, The Residences at the Ritz-Carlton give every indication that they will indeed be, well, ritzy. Flying buttresses, carved panels, and a crown of lighted art glass will adorn the exterior of the 40-story building, which was designed by the architect Lucien Lagrange with an eye toward the art moderne look of the 1930s. The 88 condos, with interiors by Darcy Bonner, will feature large windows and wide-plank floors, as well as such modern features as a portable control panel for the audio and security systems.|1
It was a bountiful year for books in English by Quebec writers. Ian McGillis looks back at some of his favourites. Putting together a Lucky 13 piece on 2016’s best books in English by Quebec writers, the thought recurs that there were years, not so long ago, when getting a list up to this count could be a challenge. Now, it’s a matter of cutting it down — agonizingly, painfully. Apologies, then, to the many books and writers — some of them featured in these very pages over the past year — who don’t appear below.|1
Who is K P Sharma Oli? The new prime minister of Nepal, K P Sharma Oli gained popularity in the 1990s for his efforts in the democratic movement that brought down the Panchayat regime. In the next few years, he became a key figure in Nepali politics. Two months after the successful conclusion of the historic parliamentary polls in Nepal, the winning party, CPN-UML on Thursday chose party chairman K P Sharma Oli as the country’s next prime minister. Oli (65) had previously served a prime ministerial term from October 11, 2015, to August 3, 2016.|1
A year ago, Palos Verdes came on strong at the end of the regular season and dominated during the postseason, with a 4-1 win over FC Dallas to advance to the Western Conference Championship. In the playoffs last spring, Palos Verdes fell short in a 1-0 loss against Real Salt Lake but were able to defeat the Colorado Rapids in six games to become the defending champion. The club has gone 0-7-1 for the first time in 11 years under new head coach Carlos Cisneros. It's third straight playoff exit in as many years.|0
What Motivates People To Break The Rules At Work? A look at what drives workplace rule-breaking, and when do people start breaking the rules? I know it has been said before but you don't always hear it in the mainstream press. In reality, there is little public attention given to those who abuse their power and influence. This is especially true when it comes to high profile cases of abuse. When a celebrity is abused, most of us are more than prepared to point the finger at them regardless of whether or not other people take action.|0
In recent years, platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their own style of gameplay. While the vast majority of contemporary platformers are made by fans of the genre, there's one particular type of developer that's managed to maintain some level of popularity among those who prefer something a little more experimental: Super Meat Boy. There was a time when it was easy to say what was happening in my head. When I was still growing up in the 1980s and 1990s, no one really believed in miracles.|0
Todd P, one of the city's top local independent music promoters, helped open up a new venue last night in Bushwick/East Williamsburg, aka East Williamsburg Industrial Park. It's called Danbro Studios Warehouse, and it's home is in a mid-1800s raw warehouse, previously home to the Goldenrod Brewery, a 1930's-era beer manufacturer long shuddered, a victim of prohibition.

"Some restaurateurs are altering menus to accommodate dieters on macro diets. When Chicago-native Vince Schiano was working toward his second job as a food safety inspector, his clientele included people who didn't want to go for a cheesesteak every Friday night. They wanted more variety in their dining choices. So, he went to the local health food stores and introduced himself by saying, ""You know I'm a vegetarian. But what about you? A lot of people will say, 'Well why don't you make your own meal instead?' And I always say, 'Because I don't really like the taste.'"""|0
Should Bikes Be Allowed On Muni Metro? A recent news report on an injured cyclist denied passage on the Muni Metro — one of four buses currently in service that will serve the San Francisco Bay Area's transit system. While this may seem outrageous, we must realize that there isn't much law to stop people from riding on Muni buses. After all, no matter what our legal standing is, we can still be fined and have the vehicle impounded. So it seems reasonable that riders could ride on other Muni bus routes without fear of being ticketed.|0

JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar: for more than two decades, women have been making a monthly pilgrimage to pray at one of Judaism’s holiest sites in a manner traditionally preserved for men, and the police have stopped them in the name of maintaining public order. But after a flurry of arrests this fall that set off an international outcry, the women arrived for December’s service to find a new protocol ordered by the ultra-Orthodox rabbi who controls the site.|1

"School opened this week, so I thought this exploration would be appropriate and valuable. Recently, I was conducting a class on business communication, and a participant brought up what might be new trend in customer service. A similar idea had been suggested in an earlier MBA graduate class I was teaching, so I suspect there might be something going on in the business world that could be worth considering. Like most ""new"" items, this one has both good and bad aspects to it. The new trend relates to what is happening in large call centers."|1

Four detection stations throughout the Large Hadron Collider will help gather huge amounts of information about what happens during each collision, possibly revealing new information about the basic makeup of the universe.

Not since the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke into fragments and collided with Jupiter in 1994 has there been as much news and excitement over a single event in the scientific community. Rather than corresponding to a massive, cosmic event, today’s news focused on the sub-atomic level.|1

"The thorny question of abortion rights is again taking center stage on Beacon Hill and putting some top officials in an uncomfortable spot, chief among them Gov. Charlie Baker. This week Baker, a Republican who supports abortion rights, celebrated the signing of a bill approving $8 million to offset the potential loss of federal funding to women's reproductive health organizations under a new Trump administration rule. That rule, dubbed a ""gag rule"" by critics, would prohibit federally funded family planning clinics from making abortion referrals or sharing office space with abortion providers."|1
Promises to replace houses sold off under the Right to Buy scheme look increasingly hollow as the Government slashes council tax by £12,600. The latest housing survey reveals that almost two thirds of households in Kensington-west are facing falling council tax rates or being forced to sell their properties. It has been calculated that only 30% of households in South Kensington will actually benefit from these cuts, meaning more than 200 families could lose out. With just over 50,000 properties available on the National Housing List, this means a further loss of £1.6 million to the taxpayer over four years.|0

Certainly one of the most brilliant dialogues in the ballet is its pas de deux.

Eighteen years ago Monday, on June 24, 1995, South Africa’s Springbok rugby team staged a stunning upset to win the Rugby World Cup against the heavily favored New Zealand. But the game was much more than just one day’s win. This was the day Nelson Mandela cemented himself as leader of all South Africans. Elected the year before, democracy was still fragile and the racial divide was still raw. Rugby was an all-white game and Springbok captain Francois Pienaar was its hero. But Mandela enlisted Pienaar’s helps to use this final to unite, instead of divide.|1
Nintendo’s ancient Power Glove remains a part of popular culture because, one, it was an epic, ET: The Game-style failure and, two, because it was a power glove.

Still, most attempts to recreate the power glove mentality, to let you use your hands to naturally manipulate digital objects in three dimensions, have been failures.|1
After seven seasons together with the Cubs, could the Theo Trio be on the verge of a breakup? That could depend on the Giants. Or the Mets. Both are looking for new general managers, and Jason McLeod, the Cubs’ top scouting and player-development executive, already has been linked to both. The Giants job opened Monday with Bobby Evans’ firing. “I’m not actively looking because of how great things are here,” said McLeod, who sat alongside team president Theo Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer during the fall 2011 news conference introducing them as the Cubs’ new front-office regime.|1

He had hoped to cap it at home after a comeback from a leg injury that threatened to derail his 2016-17 season, and now he's headed back to the big stage under a new coaching regime. Mikhail Borystov is no longer part of the Russian Olympic team; Ivan Denisov has replaced him, and Ilya Somin has been promoted to be coach of the senior men's Team Russia. The move came amid reports in March that the former Olympian could be on the verge of retirement. This week, the 26-year-old won silver at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with six world records.|0

"Clinton said this week paid family leave is possible by taxing the wealthy but states have done so without soaking the poor. ""It's a matter of raising taxes on the top one per cent and making it available to the working families who pay the price for that taxation,"" Clinton said.

WARWICK — Chariho High won six bouts with pins and defeated Pilgrim, 62-18, in a Division I crossover on Sunday. I think the best thing we can do today as a society is to ask ourselves what have we learned during these last eight years? Is America at peace with itself? If so, that would be our greatest contribution of the past few months. And there are many questions to consider: How did we get to this point? Is it inevitable? Do we still have the capacity to make changes?|0
I thought I was an acceptable kind of evangelical. I'm not a fundamentalist. My friends and I enjoy art, alcohol, and cultural engagement. We avoid spiritual clichés and buzzwords. We value authenticity, study, racial reconciliation, and social and environmental justice. Being a Christian made me somewhat weird in my urban, progressive context, but despite some clear differences, I held a lot in common with unbelieving friends. We could disagree about truth, spirituality, and morality, and remain on the best of terms. The failures of the church often made me more uncomfortable than those in the broader culture.|1

"Eurovision 2018 was winner Netta Barzilai’s finest hour, and moment of national pride for all of Israel. But the joy was marred by a technological blunder: Microsoft’s automatic translator Bing might have been responsible for an international gender snafu, all because it doesn’t get the Israeli slang expression kapara. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praise her on his social network accounts, and spoke to Barzilai on the phone during the broadcast.

Labour leader Ed Miliband doesn't have an image problem, he has a policy problem. The problem is this: Labour wants to do things that would give people the impression that they could live their life without working. One of the biggest obstacles to getting Labour policies implemented in Britain is the Conservative Party itself, which can easily be blamed for its lack of leadership on such matters, but what's even more scary is that there are many Tories who know exactly what we want and are determined to get it — at no price.|0

It has seemed for a while as though the global financial storm was going to deal a mostly glancing blow to the technology industry. Everybody hurts when markets go into free fall (and, as we're writing this on Wednesday afternoon, the Dow Jones has just closed down another 189 points -- although, as always, it could be up 500 points again by the time you read this). But if Wall Street and the banking sector are having a tornado rip through their gilded trailer parks, tech has, thus far, mostly just experienced some rain and a few gusts of wind in its relatively quiet suburb.|1

Chipolo Plus is supposedly the loudest Bluetooth item tracker available today, and its chirpy tune can be heard from a greater distance than other similar trackers. Thanks to some useful new tech, items gone missing around the house or office can announce their locations with chirpy ditties — as long as they have Bluetooth trackers attached and you're close enough to hear the trackers' songs. So can you tell the difference between those dB levels? In my tests, I could indeed hear Chipolo Plus a little bit better than the other trackers, though the difference is subtle.|1

Anime and gaming convention Momocon is on day three of it’s newly extended four-day run, which leaves plenty of time to check out some cosplay, buy some vintage video games and maybe watch a Kotaku writer judge an indie game contest.

While the SP-BSP-RLD alliance may disrupt the caste math in many pockets, the Congress is relegated to the role of an ally for the ruling BJP, which continues to make some efforts towards development. The government needs to understand that it does not stand alone against a backdrop of political turmoil across the country. There are other important parties who share the BJP's faith in India. As a result, they play an important role in the politics of the country; however, they remain largely unrepresented in Parliament and have been forced to rely entirely on the support of the national leadership.|0

One of the biggest highlights of Valve's Greenlight process for games awaiting their arrival on Steam, is that developers can be rewarded for making their games a hit, even if they aren't perfect. In fact, with only 12 days left until the release of its first-ever Dota 2 mod and no sign of another popular game hitting Steam yet, it seems safe to say that gamers are excited about the possibility of a new platform.

For three turbulent centuries, the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into the hearts of medieval Europeans. Indeed, the Viking Age, from A.D. 800-1100, was the age of the sleek, speedy longship. Without this crucial advance in ship technology, the Vikings would never have become a dominant force in medieval warfare, politics, and trade. With their invention of the longship, the Vikings spurred a literal sea change in medieval European affairs. The drekar, or dragon-headed longships, were stealthy troop-carriers.|1

American troops may have finally left Iraq, but for that nation's citizens the war is only getting worse. As we've reported in the past few weeks, the Iraqi Army and the National Guard are struggling to keep up with the growing number of U.S. airstrikes on the country's Shiite population.

Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child’s play, thanks to MIT. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a parser that imitates kids’ learning processes by observing the environment and making connections. The system studies captioned videos and learns to associate words with objects and actions. When given a new sentence, the parser can accurately predict its meaning—without visual clues. This “weakly supervised” approach, which requires limited training input, could expand the types of data and reduce the effort needed for training parsers. Annotations can certainly speed up the process, but they’re not needed to learn.|1

"What Steve Lonegan can teach Republicans about making life hell for Democrats. New Jersey Senate candidate Steve Lonegan may be taking on Democratic Rep. Joe Courtney in the hotly contested 9th district, but his main message is the same: Make government more difficult to run and less responsive to the needs of everyday people.

""People have been looking for change in Washington for years,"" Lonegan begins."|0
"In a small way, we made history. Last Saturday, an ad hoc group of citizens interested in improving an aspect of public policy sat down informally with the civil servants responsible and designed a web service to do the job.

With snow falling steadily and the temperature well below freezing, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she's joining the rest of Congress in urging the White House to take action to avert the catastrophic flooding that has devastated more than 20 coastal communities in Louisiana, Texas, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and North Carolina. The Federal Reserve last week increased the federal funds rate at the end of its three month meeting by 0.75 percent. The Fed announced the raise on April 14, a move which means it will hike its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points on March 31, 2017.|0

A group of legislators who met for the first time Thursday are calling on Gov. Nathan Deal, Senate President Andy Gardiner and House Speaker Vincent Prieto to approve legislation that would allow women to seek an abortion using state funds even when they cannot pay for the procedure. President Trump told reporters at Mar-a-Lago Wednesday that he doesn't believe any president has ever been investigated by federal law enforcement over their interactions with Russia during the 2016 election campaign.|0

In recent years, platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their artistry. For the generation of designers who grew up playing “Super Mario Bros.” platformers offer a sound formula. Though the goal of such games is usually to get from one area to the next, that framework supports copious possibilities. Determining how a character moves through a world and what sorts of things should impede or assist in the process allows plenty of room for creativity. It is why games like “Journey” and “Inside” can both be constructed around jumping avatars but otherwise appear quite distinct.|1

The Brexit crowd refused to believe the experts in the run-up to the referendum vote. The warnings from every leading economic body, including the Bank of England, were dismissed as scaremongering that should be ignored. Now, apparently, the words of the Governor of the Bank of England and other economists are so influential they can talk us into a recession – I am baffled by this double-think. But we need not agonise over all the talk now, because the facts are mounting up. Last week, we reported exclusive figures showing a sharp fall in the number of shoppers out on our high streets.|1

The first image of Earth from lunar orbit. Before an Apollo-era NASA could launch a few humans on top of a rocket and plop them down on the moon, it needed to find safe places to land. So from 1966 through 1967, the space agency launched five spacecraft, which it creatively named Lunar Orbiters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Lunar Orbiter 1 was the first to swing around the moon. It automatically took film photos, processed and scanned them, then beamed the images back as radiowaves to receivers on Earth, where technicians recorded them onto analog data tapes.|1

It has seemed for a while as though the global financial storm was going to deal a mostly glancing blow to India, but it seems now it is actually taking a much larger bite than we had been led to believe - at least on the level of growth. Fitch Ratings today released its fourth-quarter results that were in line with analyst expectations. The rating agency downgraded India's credit rating to 'BB' from 'C+'. The outlook reflects our belief that India remains vulnerable to the impacts of economic uncertainty, and may be adversely affected by continued negative currency policy risks.|0

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi routinely lands up at the airport to receive world dignitaries. From the moment a world leader sets foot on Indian soil, Modi's photo ops begin. Who can forget the famous Modi hug reserved for world leaders? Modi's Canadian counterpart, Trudeau, is equally an ace at producing visuals of himself doing things. When they landed in New Delhi on February 17 on the beginning of the Canadian prime minister's week-long trip to the country, the Trudeaus came out of the plane with a namaste, the traditional Indian greeting. But Modi wasn't there to receive them.|1
Media & Entertainment I write about women in the business of Hollywood. New research released today from the Geena Davis Institute on Gender and Media shows that we have a long way to go in our depictions of girls and women onscreen in family-friendly movies. It also showed that countries around the world must do a better job of employing women because, when they do, we see more women and girls onscreen. In their previous research, Dr. Stacy L. Smith, Marc Choueiti, & Dr. Katherine Pieper at the USC Annenberg School of Communications, looked at G, PG and PG-13 rated movies that were released in the US.|1

Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “Thank You” rally was the crowd’s silence when Trump mentioned that everyone should come together. The irony being that his campaign has been anything but unifying, which is why his supporters backed him. They’re tired of seeing this country’s demographics being changed, their white privilege being challenged. Unity and inclusion is far from what these people want — even after the election’s over. I left Cincinnati tired and disheveled, but perhaps mostly worried about our future.|1

Under Trump, presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor. Since discovering that the constitution gives him the somewhat controversial power to absolve criminals who are also his friends, Donald Trump has pardoned more people and commuted more sentences in his first 18 months in office than any of his three immediate predecessors. The pardoning spree continued on Tuesday, as Trump issued two more before jetting off to Europe to stomp all over NATO, this time clearing the names of father-son arsonist duo Dwight and Steven Hammond, Oregon cattle ranchers whose 2016 fight against the federal government became a conservative cause célèbre.|1

French President Emmanuel Macron wants to invigorate the European Union as a global power and spurn the populist nationalism that threatens to undermine its success.

Macron, who at 40 is three decades younger than Trump, disdains the president’s abrasive nature and many of his policies, notably on Iran and climate change. The French president prefers books, ideas and lofty intellectual conversation to the aggressive transactional style embodied by Trump, who favors television over written text.|1

PARIS -- France could become the latest country to ban the use of underweight fashion models. France's health ministry said Monday that underweight models are at a greater risk of contracting diseases and should be avoided unless medical experts can show they have suffered serious or fatal consequences. It's not the first time France has taken measures to protect its image, which was tarnished after pictures emerged of model Isabelle Ségur being filmed having sex in front of a baby shower. In April 2009, French police arrested a 37-year-old woman after photographs of her wearing skimpy bikini went viral online.|0
The J. C. Penney Company, the fourth-largest United States retailer, said today that September sales at stores open at least a year were falling short of expectations, prompting several analysts to cut fiscal third-quarter earnings estimates. Warm weather and consumer concerns about the decline in United States stock markets hurt sales of clothes, notebooks and other back-to- school products, retailer analysts said. J. C. Penney's same-store sales may decline as much as 5 percent this month, they said. The company's goal was to increase sales as much as 4 percent.|1

AMD's Ryzen CPUs offer some of the best bang for the buck, but which is best? AMD knocked it out of the park with the first and second generations of its Ryzen CPUs built upon the Zen and Zen+ architecture. It certainly helped wash away the taste of its less-than-stellar Bulldozer chips that launched in 2011. Ryzen provides far better per-core performance, power efficiency, and support for more modern technology. But that makes it harder than ever to decide which one to buy. The Ryzen family is broken into four distinct branches, targeting the entry-level, mainstream, performance, and high-end enthusiast sectors of the market.|1
Today marks the 314th anniversary of the last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. Geological records indicate that this 9.0 magnitude quake struck around 9 p.m. Jan. 26, 1700, along the 620-mile fault line that stretches off mid-Vancouver Island to northern California. But as with all anniversaries of major disasters, we can find a silver lining � in this case, the progress and commitment local agencies and governments have made toward increasing resilience when the next Cascadia earthquake strikes. Oregon�s offshore seismic fault mirrors the subduction zone that caused the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami that killed thousands of people and destroyed entire villages.|1

Steve Norris is former Conservative transport minister. Britain can reasonably claim to have invented the railway. Stephenson’s Rocket represented the pinnacle of British industrial-era innovation. The ability to move products and people by steam locomotion had a transformative effect on society. British ingenuity saw railways knit communities together across the country, and eventually the globe. And for the next couple of centuries, little changed. The same techniques are being used to maintain track now that were used in Stephenson’s time."|1
Other events add to the excitement. They, too, are a lot of work. But they add up to a great feeling of celebration that gives us a moment to reflect on the things we love about our country. The huge water balloon fight that one Richland neighborhood organizes is a fun reminder that we are all in this together. We suspect that a great many of us don't know our neighbors well. People are more likely to have friends on Facebook who may live on the other side of the country than friends on their street.|1
Following a team of international scientists, this film exclusively documents an archeological sensation: the exploration of royal tombs beneath the ancient Mexican city of Teotihuacán. Despite many decades of research, not much is known about the long-lost Teotihuacán society. But when archeologists enter the newly discovered burial chambers, they find the clues that may finally tell us who these mysterious people were. The film incorrectly states the city of Tikal is in Mexico when it is in Guatemala. Secrets of the Dead strives to get the facts correct and we regret the error.|1

MILLERSBURG -- If laughter really is the best medicine, then the people who turned out for the inaugural Standup Comedy Festival here Thursday night aren't laughing at all, even though a small audience showed up to hear comedian Josh Matlack on stage. The first-year comedy festival kicked off with about 30 comedians in the audience and many more standing around for a chance to play a game of musical chairs.

Although state trademark registration offers fewer benefits than trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, state trademark registration can be a cheap alternative for securing limited trademark rights. Federal trademark registration can run anywhere from several hundred dollars to $3,000, depending on the type of mark being registered and the amount of attorney's fees. On the other hand, many states charge less than $100 to file a trademark application. Keep in mind that state registration will not offer multi-state protection, nationwide priority status, incontestability, a presumption of validity or the ability to file a trademark on an intent to use basis.|1

The word hero gets thrown around so much that its use has lost much of the intended impact. Indie games, like The Legend of Zelda, may have started as an opportunity for creators to experiment, and now many of them are coming to fruition. But perhaps the best case study of the genre's success is not one made by a developer, but a publisher. By the late '80s, I was living in Toronto, Canada. While I worked at an auto-repair shop on the west side of Hamilton, Ont., I also taught English at a youth hostel in the nearby community of St. Marys.|0

An extra $190,000 in state special education reimbursement funding that came in late last month has helped the town pay off its nearly half million-dollar settlement with the district's bus drivers union, officials said this week. Together with around $300,000 in savings found in the district's fiscal 2011 budget, the money has covered the town's $497,000 obligation to the drivers, whose jobs have been outsourced to a private busing company. The additional special education money, part of the state's circuit breaker program, will prevent the town from having to carry the debt over into fiscal 2012, officials said.|1

One minute he was strutting around the end zone, staring into the stands, the look of a stone-cold killer in his eyes.

I have written previously about my own pets, and the most common prompt for me to do this has been when my own animals have reached the end of their lives. For me, it has been a type of grief therapy sometimes, with the opportunity to write an obituary for an animal that's been an important part of my life. This week, the good news is that this is not an obituary. One of my two cats, Couscous, has been unwell, but so far, treatment has been successful, so this is a tale about her illness, not about her death.|1

Holwell Sports reached their first Senior County Cup final in 17 years on Tuesday evening after a penalty shoot-out win over Heather St Johns. John Webster’s side raced into an early two-goal lead but were left hanging on through 90 minutes and then extra time as Heather fought back to level.

Assistant manager Andy Hill said: “I thought Heather were a very good footballing side, and it was a hard-fought win for us rather than a brilliant performance.|1

"Before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married, the tabloids floated a strange rumour: the couple might elope. Would they run off to Jamaica? Hawaii? Toronto?

COLOGNE CATHEDRAL SWITCHED off its light last night, in protest at the weekly anti-Islam rallies happening in Dresden. The symbolic act came as thousands of Germans demonstrated in Cologne and several other cities against the ongoing protests by the group calling itself Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West. PEGIDA attracted its biggest crowd yet in Dresden yesterday – more than 18,000 people. Cologne Cathedral provost Norbert Feldhoff, told n-tv that shutting down the lights was an attempt to make the PEGIDA demonstrators think twice about their protest.

I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad’s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should not constantly be called to account for the vicious behaviour of IS. Still less to be stigmatised until unnamed Muslim leaders disowned it. I was disconcerted to see so many Eureka Street readers appeared to agree with the demands against which she protested. Both Ruby’s complaint and the responses to it reminded me of the attitudes taken to Catholics in an earlier generation. The popular charges against Catholics were honed in the Great War and particularly by the referenda on Conscription.|1

When Pacers coach Frank Vogel announced he would sit all five starters for last night's game against the Bucks, it was like a thought experiment come to life. Can a good team's second unit beat the starters of a historically awful team? It was close, but...yes!

Because this wasn't Copeland and Solomon Hill and C.J. Watson getting meaningful minutes in just any late-season game—this game mattered.|1
Cryptocurrencies, outside of Bitcoin, have failed to garner much attention from buyers, and while the same can be said of sellers, the digestion of losses over the past month is likely to lead to more losses soon. Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin are all carving out a similar bear-flag pattern that should lead to another purge of speculative excesses. Weak price action in ETH/USD has it set up to make another leg lower soon. It could continue to drift ever-so-slightly higher, but the developing bear-flag implies risk is skewed more heavily towards the downside.|1

The Australian telecommunications (telco) industry is largely responsible for the highly connected and digital world we live in today. Their networks and services have fostered professional work environments and have brought together family and friends amidst Australia’s vast distances, and remote global position.

In fact Accenture, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, has estimated that digitalisation could contribute approximately $100 trillion in value to the telecommunications industry over the next decade globally. Australian telecommunications operators have long maintained vast networks, held together by complex infrastructure.|1

It is time to get serious about tackling climate change, and if we don't, we will end up living like this planet does: wet, barren, and hungry forever. It doesn't have to seem like such a scary idea. In reality, it's not all that bad. For one thing, you need to go outside. You need to make the effort to walk. And you need more water than we are getting right now.|0
The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep. That is the provocative implication of recent research that examined investors’ financial risk-taking following periods when their sleep was disrupted. I concede that advice to get more sleep is hardly new, since we’ve been hearing that most of our lives — and the advice is honored more in the breach than in the observance. Furthermore, retirees typically would like to sleep more, but can’t — due to the disruptions in sleep patterns that are a normal part of the aging process.|1
Tropical Storm Selma made landfall on the coast of El Salvador on Saturday with strong winds, heavy rains and a severe storm surge reaching more than 8 metres (25 feet) in some areas, authorities said. There are currently over 600 countries around the world which have implemented some kind of global climate change plan. Of all these countries, Australia has an ambitious plan to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 20 per cent by 2050. A number of studies show that this plan can be achieved - but is it practical or cost efficient? I asked Climate Action Tracker co-founder Kevin Trenberth about Australia's plans.|0
A Manitoba woman has been sent to prison for hiding the remains of six infants in a rented storage locker, but court never heard an explanation as to what prompted her to hide the babies she conceived over many years. Andrea Giesbrecht, 43, bit her lip and looked straight ahead, but showed little emotion as she was sentenced Friday to 8 1/2 years. Provincial court Judge Murray Thompson said Giesbrecht’s moral culpability was extreme and the sentence needed to be strong enough to denounce her behaviour. “These were newly delivered infants, our most vulnerable,” Thompson said in his decision that was livestreamed by Winnipeg media.|1
The Scimitar-horned Oryx no longer lives in the African desert. It is considered extinct in the wild. But this lovely-looking Ungulate hasn’t been completely wiped out because they can still be found at zoos around the world. It’s just one example of a new role that zoos have taken on: preserving endangered wildlife. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lists 361 endangered mammals worldwide. Add in birds, fish, reptiles and other living creatures, that number rises to nearly 1200. That’s why the work of organizations like the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute – or SCBI – is so crucial.|1
Crucially though, these guys don't stop at food production. While their commercial services seem to focus on a handful of different products, the whole concept of the business is that it allows them to grow into a very big company, with revenues of about $40 million. A team of physicists and geophysicists led by Aarhus University has developed a new form of nuclear fusion energy which could generate large quantities of clean, renewable electricity. The research, published in Nature Geoscience, uses a small amount of neutrons – superluminescent atoms that give off intense light as they smash together – used in a process called fission.|0
The Bridge City Cardinals are the boys 22-4A district champions in tennis. The team participated in the district tournament in Beaumont last week. Taking home the silver medal in Boys Singles was Lorenz Schrader. Schrader played an epic four hour match in the finals before falling 5-7; 7-5; 7-6 (5) to Hardin Jefferson. In the Boys Doubles division, the Perry brothers once again dominated. Camden and Kian dropped only two games in their move thru the bracket. Also in the Boys Doubles, Salvador Torres and Alberto Munguia captured the bronze medal for the Cardinals.|1

We chose to question the narrative of history by simply quoting words which Churchill used himself. At a glance, Blighty Café appears to be another one of those trendy and sophisticated coffee shops that offer the terribly appealing combination of tasteful beverages, off-beat music and the inviting aroma of freshly-baked sourdough bread. As a university student living in the area, of course, I couldn’t resist. Sounds perfect, right? Except, sitting in the mock air-raid shelter, drinking my flat white, I couldn’t help but feel ever more uncomfortable.|1
"This isn't just a museum ; in 2005, the Knesset ( Israel's parliament ) passed a law to establish an Islamic institution that would be recognized as ""state-licensed"" and would be allowed to operate. In its application to the Supreme Court, the mosque argued that it could not be legally recognized without the approval of the Supreme Court. That's a problem. A group of four prominent members of Jerusalem's Christian community have sued on behalf of themselves and three others, alleging that they were violated of their rights under the Israeli Civil Service Act (ISC) by the Interior Ministry over allegations of discrimination."|0

Marco Cecchinato, 19, was eliminated from his semifinal round match in the men's final last week after dropping to 5-6. After a tense first 15 minutes of action, he rallied for a 2-7, 6-3 victory on Roland Garros and made it 4-0 before falling 3-6 to the defending champion Rafael Nadal in their semifinal game at The Oval. Fabrice Anand, 23, who lost to Rafael Nadal in his semifinal round match on Tuesday, finished with an 8-6 (10) record."|0
Plushenko’s glorious career was finished. He had hoped to cap it at home after a comeback from spinal surgery, which he did, partially, by helping Russia win the team competition. But his 31-year-old back, after all those years of wrenching revolutions and hard landings, gave out two nights too soon. In essence, Plushenko sacrificed his chance at another individual medal to put his country on top. He was a longshot for gold, but in a sport of sequins and stuffed animals, he brought pugnacious sizzle. He was the James Cagney of the ice.|1
Under construction at 664 North Michigan Avenue, the former site of the Terra Museum of American Art, The New York City Museum of Asian Art was opened on June 4, 2012 with the intention of providing a museum of contemporary art and cultural heritage.

The rumor mill is spinning this morning. In the midst of getting divorced from his wife, Vanessa Trump reportedly met a man who promised to get them married and have a child with her. According to reports, the two had an argument during their trip to New Zealand, where she was in town visiting relatives, and Donald Trump allegedly said he was sorry if she left him on the flight home. A spokesperson for the Trumps confirmed that the couple did indeed exchange vows, but would not elaborate further as they are still trying to settle their marital affairs.|0
The Mountain Home Lady Bombers held the No. 4 ranked team in Class 5A to five field goals over its final six games and finished with a 9-3 record on the season. In the aftermath of last night's win over North Carolina, it's obvious there was a lot of drama on both ends of the field. It is hard to predict exactly what that drama will result in this weekend as both teams remain tied in the Atlantic Coast Conference standings at 6–6 (5-5 overall). But I can tell you who deserves a lot of blame.|0
"It's hard to imagine that 2001 : A Space Odyssey would have its incredible cinematic impact without that classical sound effect. So while the world may now think of Kubrick as a film pioneer, it seems he may have left behind many more films in his dustbin. Kathleen Saroyan is an award winning filmmaker who has made several documentaries for PBS-TV NewsHour, The New York Times, NPR, and others. She has recently finished her second season of the Netflix docu-series ""Feminists & Power"" based on her recent book about how women change the way they are viewed by society."|0
Beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl is never easy. When they scored 21 points the first three times they held the ball in the second half and took a 33-32 lead, we all thought the same scary movie we’ve seen since 2001 was replaying before our eyes. But this epic brought a different ending. This one saw Foles, a man of faith who wants to be a pastor when he leaves the game, play as if touched by God. He completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.|1

Boulder has sued the fossil fuel companies. Probably 15 percent or so of us would be alive today without it. What's worse is that we've done nothing to try and stop it, which is why it's such a shame when people who want to help are ignored. Last November, I wrote about how we need to take stock of all the things we don't know about the climate crisis. Now it seems like we haven't had enough time to do some research. In fact, it's now estimated that the human population is rising faster than the planet can handle.|0
Peter Brimelow writes : On November 21, 2008, I spoke in Baltimore at the inaugural meeting of the Association for the Study of Black Americans. It was here that I first heard about the importance of race relations in America. My impression is that black Americans have been neglected for years as a major national issue. As a former law clerk and current professor, I know first-hand how deeply rooted are our problems. Our school systems do not provide equal opportunities for students of color. Racial bias against African-Americans in all forms of public education has grown steadily in recent years.|0
On April 22, 2014, Hollingsworth was supposed to drop off 20-month-old Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth at a child-care center in Woodstock, but she wasn't there. She was instead on the way to her daughter's kindergarten class when she was pulled over for an open container of marijuana possession. After police found a joint in the boot of her vehicle, which was later impounded, Hollingsworth was charged with possessing and transporting marijuana by deception. On April 23, 2014, the day after the baby was born, she filed a lawsuit claiming that the police had improperly stopped her because she is pregnant.|0
The new law finishes old business in Trenton and expands the so-called Tuition Equality Act, which let qualified immigrants pay in-state tuition. Going to college is not cheap these days. In fact, for many in New Jersey, it is unaffordable. Gov. Phil Murphy’s signing into law a bill that allows undocumented immigrants to apply for state financial aid to help pay for college beginning this fall won’t help all who hope to attend a post-secondary school, but it could help many. With Murphy’s signing, New Jersey becomes the 10th state to extend financial aid to undocumented college students.|1

Labour leader Ed Miliband doesn't have an image problem, he has a policy problem. The problem is he doesn't have any, or at least policies that answer the gravity of the situation. Millions of people suffer as inflation outstrips wages. The cost of food, transport, fuel and housing skyrocket. A million people have visited food banks. This is not only a joyless recovery, for the vast majority of people it's a moneyless one.

Asked if LearnIslam.sg was created to counter websites which may have radical messages, Dr Yaacob said this would narrow the potential of the site.|1

Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party’s nominee, will secure their respective seats in strongly Democratic districts following primary victories earlier this year that effectively decided their races. Omar, in addition to being one of the first Muslim women in Congress, will also be the first Somali-American member. She came to the US more than two decades ago as a refugee.

In the age of Instagram, food is no longer designed to just be food. It’s a set piece, a lifestyle statement of fantastical hyperbole. So we drink unicorn lattes, eat rainbow bagels, and lick our charcoal-black soft serve in front of neon signs. Food is no longer about eating.

In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don’t report to presidents. In Russia, things are different. Most of those businesses are majority-state-owned corporations, virtual branches of the government.

In 2000, when Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency, he consolidated competing power centers — media, business, local government, opposition parties and the Parliament — under his authority. He called it “a vertical of power.” This system now includes organized crime and cybercriminals.|1

A new study for The New York Times reveals that the media pay for the top 200 CEOs is now $14.5 million. This is up 55 in the last year. While any one CEO may be well worth his/her raise, it is a growing political and PR problem for corporate America to be seen as rewarding those at the top, with little consideration for actual performance. For millions of Americans who are unemployed, under employed and being foreclosed on, it seems inconceivable that corporate CEOs can be getting significant raises at a time of such economic hardship.|1

While talking, he would suddenly push out a breathy deep, ""UHH...UHH,"" which came every three of four words. It was a severe stutter problem.

So instead, astronauts would need to build their own rockets from scratch at a cost well in excess of 10 million dollars.

Aid agencies are tentatively also giving away cash and letting refugees decide for themselves what they need. While the results may be unexpected, the money is being wisely spent and rarely wasted - contrary to old prejudices among donors.|1

New York/London : Volatility returned to US markets, with stocks tumbling back toward a bear market after the biggest single selloff in almost three years. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.05% and Nasdaq Composite Index NEQ, -0.06% each lost more than 1 percent of their value on Tuesday as fears mounted that investors are ready for a repeat of 2008's global financial crisis.

Two years ago, Red Sox prospect Ryan Westmoreland seemed to be on the fast track to the majors. His season ended abruptly in September when he tore his ACL during a baseball workout. He was placed on injured reserve and did not return until May 15. In his first professional start, Westmoreland allowed two runs on eight hits and six walks while striking out five in 4 1/3 innings of relief against Milwaukee. He posted a 3.74 ERA in 14 starts in 2015 before suffering a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his left wrist in May. The 25-year-old Waltham man is eligible for waivers this offseason.|0
The Jawbone Up debuted last year with big ambitions: A bracelet-like device that you'd wear all the time, tracking how much you move and how well you sleep. Paired with an app, the Up helps you recognize patterns in your habits, empowering you to improve your health. One problem: It wasn't built to withstand the punishment of being a wearable device. Unlike a cellphone that resides in your pocket or a bag, the Up wraps around your wrist, exposed to the world just as much as your skin is. Many users found it quickly malfunctioned, and Jawbone recalled the Up and issued refunds.|1
Two years ago, Red Sox prospect Ryan Westmoreland seemed to be on the fast track to the majors. The Portsmouth native, who the Sox selected in the fifth round of the 2008 draft, got off to a blazing start in his professional career in 2009 in Single-A Lowell. In 60 games with the Spinners, the outfielder hit .296 with seven homers and 19 stolen bases, and his five-tool potential helped him quickly ascend up everyone's list of top Red Sox prospects. But all of that changed in a hurry when, in March of 2010, he was diagnosed with a cavernous malformation in his brain.|1
The battle over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s new “borrower education tool” unveiled earlier this week is heating up, with the National Association of Mortgage Bankers now joining the Mortgage Bankers Association in calling on the CFPB to take the “Rate Checker” online tool down. The CFPB’s new interactive page has come under fire because it mentions rates and costs without including disclosure items that TILA-RESPA rules mandate for borrowers – annual percentage rate, closing fees, etc. “This tool will do nothing but confuse consumers in their shopping experience,” said John Councilman, president of NAMB.|1

Akshara Haasan had what you would call a dream debut in Bollywood with ‘Shamitabh’. While the 2015 film was helmed by R Balki, the debutante actress none other than Amitabh Bachchan and Tamil superstar Dhanush as her co-actors. The actress’ next outing in Bollywood was ‘Laali Ki Shaadi Mein Laaddoo Deewana’ (2017), which saw her share screen space with Vivaan Shah.

Who pulled the plug on the canal this time? It’s winter, and we’re certainly not in the middle of a drought, so what’s happened to this stretch of the Grand Union Canal? The Cooks Wharf area of the canal appears to have drained away again, just four months after the same section was left bereft of water. The area sits just outside Cheddington on the way to Marsworth. In August there was a similar scene after a boater left a lock gate paddle open – the gates control the flow of water in the lock.|1

However, T.I. insists that she's just as creative as any other rap artist in the game. If you are considering purchasing a home, do not be afraid to seek out an appraiser for expert advice. For decades, appraisers have been required to comply with both state and federal housing regulations. The State of California currently requires homeowners to contact their local housing authority to receive a list of all residential properties that will sell within five years or face fines and legal action. There are many good reasons to go this route, but first you should thoroughly evaluate whether you can afford to buy at the market rate.|0

Considering all the comings and goings of people involved in the project, we should be grateful that Bohemian Rhapsody has finally landed on the big screen. Changing directors and lead actors puts a seed of doubt in minds as to how successful a film is likely to be. However, it’s a worthy biopic of Freddie Mercury, and Queen. There’s no argument that Rami Malek is great as the famed lead singer, but Ben Hardy (Roger Taylor), Gwilym Lee (Brian May) and Joseph Mazzello (John Deacon) also look and sound the part.|1

NSA Director General Keith Alexander maintains that his agency's tactics are lawful and used against foreign adversaries. The US government says that its cyber operations have thwarted a wide variety of intrusions into computer networks in more than 100 countries. But some security experts say the practice amounts to a form of propaganda aimed at strengthening Russia, while others say it could give Russia an edge. This week, the White House will host President Donald Trump's defense chief, James Mattis. It is one of the highest-profile positions on the national security council — and one that typically serves as a liaison for the president on national security policy issues.|0
"At least 21 people were killed and hundreds wounded in four days of fighting between two rival tribes in the border city of Tuz Khormato, a government official said on Thursday.

Even as its board expresses interest in building a branch museum downtown ( see `` City for challenges. ``); the agency has yet to make an official proposal. There's a general feeling within the agency that it's too soon to discuss whether it plans to build a city-wide, public-arts complex. That's because several of its top administrators and staff are on short leave or have left in recent weeks amid the ongoing budget negotiations. The agency would like to keep these people around but doesn't want to risk compromising its academic mission.|0

WATCH : Sunday marked the third anniversary of B.C. declaring a public health emergency because of the overdose crisis. Nationally, fentanyl deaths are up over 40 per cent since 2013, Canada's Health Ministry said Thursday.

What Steve Lonegan can teach Republicans about making life hell for Democrats. New Jersey Senate candidate Steve Lonegan may not beat Cory Booker, but his run offers some interesting lessons for Republicans.

Steve Lonegan, Booker’s opponent, is running his third statewide campaign, his first as a nominee.|1
Last week, we learned that the Obama administration is considering other alternatives to stop foreclosures. Today, we have some color on what one of these efforts might look like. It would encourage servicers to reduce struggling borrowers' mortgage balance. Although banks have fought such efforts in the past, it seems that the program could benefit everyone involved. And the best part: it wouldn't take any taxpayer dollars. Of the residential mortgage-backed securities outstanding, about $1.3 trillion are so-called private label notes that were issued by banks and other financial institutions, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.|1

ORANGEBURG, S.C. — Talk-show host and media mogul Oprah Winfrey has conducted a jailhouse interview with a South Carolina mother who pleaded guilty to killing her two sons. Winfrey went to the jail in Orangeburg last week where 30-year-old Shaquan Duley is awaiting sentencing.

Weber begins to wonder what will happen if he can figure out where all these ships are heading? The pilot is played by Michael Gough, who also plays Lt.|0
Damn, aside from Tom Tykwer desperately trying to get out of there at the 30 minute mark, and their publicist throwing out a bit of a burn towards DP at the very end, it was a great interview. Loved the epic rants on the philosophical nature of “Revolutions,” as well as Andy Wachowski’s understandable annoyance with film junkets. Amazing interview…I wish I had the chance to catch the late screening with Q&A at Fantastic Fest…Profound love/respect/admiration to the Wachowskis, Tykwer, and you David. Cornel West was not joshing when he said Lana was laser smart.|1
"Made of Q-Tips, this craft goes far beyond a miniature garland or cake topper. The light strand also serves as the foundation for the base of a small and elegant tablecloth.

Slack said the deal is part of its continued efforts to make the collaboration hub more flexible beyond engineering and IT. Slack on Tuesday said that it's acquired Missions, a startup behind a tool that lets non-developers build custom integrations and automate routine processes in Slack. Slack said the acquisition -- it's third ever -- is part of its continued efforts to make the collaboration hub more flexible beyond engineering and IT. Custom integrations are apparently a big deal in Slack, with around 65 percent of paid teams having built one of their own.|1
Or not. In the world of digital photography, you don't have to flash a smile. Instead, just digitally paint a grin on your face afterward. Struggling for hours to get just the right shot under the optimum lighting conditions is so analog. Today, digital photography allows any wannabe Ansel Adams to create a photographic masterpiece in homage to the 20th century landscape marvel. And with a good smartphone camera and the right camera app, the tools are in everyone's hands. In the past couple of years, editing apps that create different styles of pictures have become much more sophisticated and robust.|1

That's how I would characterize my minimal pre-service time. Fortunately and unfortunately though, I had very little opportunity to really spend my free time playing. And when I did take the time, it wasn't focused on any one project. In his latest column for Politico, James Fallows argues that America does not live in a period of moral crisis. For decades, historians have identified two major eras: World War I (1914–71) and World War II (beginning in 1942). He believes that we can safely say that these two periods marked different stages in American history.|0
There was no shortage of activity taking place on the Grammy stage Sunday night – Motown tributes, Havana reproductions and Diana Ross in a billowing red dress wishing herself a happy 75th birthday a month in advance. But backstage was a steady stream of winners who were happy to chat about the new hardware they were taking home from the 61st annual Grammy Awards.

Technology ’ s continuing onslaught, and employees ’ responses to it, will be central issues for the American economy. But a growing number of investors and industry experts argue that, in some ways, this may not be such a bad thing. For the past several years, the world has turned its gaze to digital currencies as a vehicle for financial innovation. It is an emerging market with billions of dollars of new investment capital pouring into the fledgling space. And at the same time, many companies are using cryptocurrencies to make their own payments — even as they seek to compete with traditional bank operations.|0
The `` Checkout with Instagram '' feature could add $ 10 billion of revenue for Facebook in 2021, Deutsche Wirtschafts GmbH estimates.

When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher, only the deepest, most corrosive cynicism is possible. Trampling on the rights of others for political advantage was the modus operandi of Adelaide's Nomenclature Committee in 1837. Western Buddhism and Pentecostalism are sometimes criticised as self-indulgent forms of religion. Is Bishop Spong's Christian humanism any different? The press coverage of Iraq’s surprise victory in the Asian Cup final was — as Ernst Bloch might have put it — full of utopian sentiment. The win was, admittedly, a remarkable achievement, but one that hardly accounted for the sheer exuberance of the outpoured emotion that followed.|1
The Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association, of which this reporter is a member, has named Moonlight as the best film of 2016, as part of the results of its 23rd annual critics’ poll. The intimate drama that follows a boy living in inner city Miami through three stages of his young life was also given three other awards: best director for Barry Jenkins, best supporting actor for Mahershala Ali, and the the Russell Smith Award, an honor given annually to the best low-budget or cutting-edge independent film.

HARRY REDKNAPP went to Madrid to scout goal thief Diego Forlan on Thursday night but ended up being mugged himself. He was targeted by pickpockets outside the Vicente Calderon stadium before the game where he intended watching Atletico Madrid striker Forlan and Real midfielder Lassana Diarra – who did not play. Redknapp, who lost several hundred pounds of cash and credit cards, said: “Forlan’s a good, interesting player. But it was difficult to concentrate on the game, because I got mugged, had my pockets picked, before the game. It was strange, weird.|1

Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of flaws in the way universal credit is designed, campaigners say. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG ) said arbitrary rules built in to the way universal credit is calculated leave some families unable to predict how much they will be paid each month, leaving households in debt and unable to budget. It can lead to claimants being wrongly benefit-capped – a penalty designed to “incentivise” jobless or low-earning households by severely limiting their benefits – because the system fails to spot they are working and earning enough.|1
BALTIMORE -- Mayor Martin O'Malley says his role in a new John Travolta film, `` Ladder 49, '' has been taken over by the actor's daughter, who plays his wife.

In Ladder 49, he plays an ex-cop who goes back to work after being forced to retire. The movie tells the story of a man who moves to the city after retiring from police work.|0
On April 22, 2014, Hollingsworth was supposed to drop off 20-month-old Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth at a child-care center about 7:30 a.m. But he “forgot her in the car,” according to an arrest warrant affidavit filed by a North Richland Hills police investigator. “This is a disabled veteran who had several things on his mind that day and just forgot,” Lex Johnston of Hurst, Hollingsworth’s attorney, said Tuesday. Johnston said Hollingsworth’s daughter and four children were living with him, and he took the daughter to work, paid for child care and drove the grandchildren to day care or school.|1
Two capitals are look set to burst through the 40C mark and another swelters through its 10th day of a heatwave. Melbourne is set to hit 42C today, a figure a climate expert has called a once in a decade heat event. Adelaide’s CBD has seen temperatures soar to 41C on Thursday as south eastern Australia sweats its way through 36 hours of “intense heat”. At 2.30pm Adelaide’s CBD reached its forecast high for the day and is likley to keep on climbing. Further inland, Port Augusta touched 44.7C, Ceduna 45.5C and Nullabor 46.2C at 1.40pm.|1
Planting the Savannah grasses in front of Cary Home seemed like a good idea in 2013, when they received $1.5 million from the state of Georgia for the project. It was a bold move, but one rooted in a sense of civic responsibility. In April 2013, local activists joined together to raise money to pay for landscaping services for the property. Now, however, there is growing concern that Savannah residents might be negatively impacted if they were forced to use some of those funds — or if they were to replace them with public dollars, which would have higher maintenance costs.|0
Amazon.com's purchase of Austin-based Whole Foods Market is showing up in the wine category. As this year ends, Amazon has shut down Wine.Woot and its own wine marketplace in favor of Whole Foods' expansive wine operation. Now that Amazon owns Whole Foods, a licensed seller of wine, it comes under different state laws and can't sell directly from a producer. As a result, Dallas entrepreneur Matt Rutledge sees an opening in the marketplace. When Amazon.com purchased daily deals site Woot.com, based in Carrollton, in 2010 it also acquired Wine.Woot, a direct producer-to-consumer website that Amazon adopted for its own wine marketplace.|1

What's the difference between bipolar I and bipolar II? Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that causes mania and depression, which often occur in the early stages of treatment. The most common symptoms of bipolar I are mood swings or mania-depression. These may last for two to six weeks or longer. Cannabis has been touted as a medicine for years now but little research has ever really supported the drug's effectiveness in patients with serious medical illnesses. It also remains difficult to measure how much cannabis users might actually be using, and there aren't any reliable studies comparing it to alcohol, cigarettes or pharmaceutical drugs.|0

The Geo Quiz has an American culinary twist this time. The city we want you to name was named after a French city, located on the banks of the Loire River.

Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of a system in which many people have been paying their private medical bills but still getting nothing in return, according to the charity Action for People. The group's research found that out of every £1 spent on private healthcare bills, up to one in 10 pay less than £5 in tax. This includes those earning just under £23,000 a year or £2,000 a year above the poverty line (£30,800 for a family of five).|0

There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams's performances that could, roughly, be called his American and British sides. On the American side, there was the slushy tendency towards sentimentality, for which he became increasingly known, which, at its best, resulted in Dead Poets Society, The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire, and, at its worst, became Patch Adams and Old Dogs. Hollywood has long had a tendency to adopt the finest and most interesting comedians and then determinedly blunt the hard edges that make them interesting. Along with Richard Pryor, Williams was the most obvious example of that.|1

In 1890, a group of eight large New York City bakeries combined to form the New York Biscuit Company and built a giant six-story factory in West Chelsea.

In 1901, the National Biscuit Company put their abbreviated company name on a box of wafers for the first time – Nabisco. Soon, Nabisco became the company's official name.|1

"(CNN) — Portuguese sailors called it the ""Gates of Hell."" Namibia's Bushmen speak of the land God made in anger. From the air, the bleak shoreline of the Skeleton Coast looks wonderful -- a deep green sea, fringed with surf, breaks over a shore receding into infinite dunes. From land, it's a different story. The Benguela Current rushes in, urgent and strong, hurtling the chilling Atlantic into the fierce heat of the Namib. Whale and seal skeletons from the former whaling industry still litter the coastline -- the source of the region's frightening name."|1

But who knew that Scrooge was not just a fictionalized version of an American billionaire but also a very real human being?

"Mission of Burma: Signals, Calls, and Marches / Vs.
Thirty years later, Mission of Burma still sounds like the future. Mission of Burma is a band with a lot to offer acolytes of cool post-punk minimalism who prefer a little anthemic arena rock and musical invention with their explorations of modern sterility. The Boston trio of Roger Miller, Clint Conley, and Peter Prescott brought exuberance and lyricism to their noise rock, producing only one full-length studio album before disbanding in 1983. Producer Martin Swope added the tape effects that lend the band its dreamlike, blurred-around-the-edges sound."|1
The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has proposed to ask some insurance companies to mandatorily list on exchanges based on the number of years they have been in business.

This will also apply to all life insurers that have completed 10 years. Irdai said firms that have already exceeded these criteria must list within three years from the date when the guidelines are issued.|1

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Democrat John Edwards endorsed former rival Barack Obama on Wednesday, a move designed to help solidify support for the party’s likely presidential nominee even as Hillary Rodham Clinton refuses to give up her long-shot candidacy. The endorsement came a day after Clinton defeated Obama by more than 2-to-1 in the West Virginia primary. The loss highlighted Obama’s challenge in winning over the “Hillary Democrats” — white, working-class voters who also supported Edwards in significant numbers before he exited the race in late January. He said Obama “stands with me” in a fight to cut poverty in half within 10 years.|1
Running errands on your bicycle is a great way to burn calories and get some exercise. When you need something small or you are just checking prices and availability, pedaling to the store can be a pleasant experience if you can find a bicycle-friendly route. Several major shopping locations in the Rogue Valley can be accessed by bicycles without encountering excessive traffic. For example, both the Rogue Valley Mall and the Medford Shopping Center are easily accessible from the Bear Creek Greenway bicycle path. It is somewhat more difficult to ride a bike to the big-box stores along Highway 62 (Crater Lake Highway).|1

The election is wide open, pitting Islamists against men who served under deposed leader Hosni Mubarak.

Few pause to notice the prim patch of well-tended green, bounded by an iron fence, that holds some of Cottage Grove's earliest pioneers. The cemetery, designated a historic site by the Washington County Historical Society, has ties to the founders of Mars Inc., the giant candy manufacturing company.|1

A new study out tonight from the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project says that 72 percent of U.S. Internet users have gone online in the past year specifically for health-related information, and 77 percent of that group says their research started at Google, Bing or another general search engine.|1

"This week, in a closed-door meeting of Congressional Democrats with President Obama, Representative Ed Perlmutter of Colorado bluntly said what has been on many politicians' minds: ""Larry Summers. Bad choice."" Mr. Obama was visibly annoyed and mounted a defense of Mr. Summers, his former economic policy adviser who also served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Summers, who the president said had become something of a ""progressive whipping boy,"" appears to be a strong contender to succeed Ben S. Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve."|1
Ryanair has lowered its full year profit guidance from a current range of €1.25-€1.35 billion to a new range of €1.10-€1.20 billion. The decision, which saw shares in the airline fall by more than ten per cent, comes after a turbulent period for the low-cost carrier. The Irish airline was recently hit by a fall in traffic after pilots and cabin crew in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Portugal went on strike. Ryanair has also been forced to lower fares for the third quarter of the year (particularly for the October school half-term holidays and Christmas) as customer confidence has been affected by fear of further strikes.|1
Syrian sources said April 14 that the Jordanian charge d'affaires in Lebanon, Hisham Moheisen, who was kidnapped from his residence Feb. 6, had been released in the Lebanese resort town of Shtoura.

Millions of refugees have fled their homes in war-torn Syria since 2011 . President Barack Obama previously planned to resettle 10,000 over the next year. But following the massive terror attacks in Paris over the weekend where at least 129 died, many governors and legislators — mostly Republicans — have called for Obama to rethink the resettlement strategy. Delaware is one of at least nine states to openly welcome the idea of refugees, despite an avalanche of largely Republican governors opposing.

PARIS -- France could become the latest country to ban the use of underweight fashion models. France's health minister says she supports a proposal that would criminalize advertising that features anorexic models.

The five-storied 'Farhad Mansion' resembles any other well-maintained house in an affluent neighbourhood of Chittagong city. Yet no gatekeeper guards any of the two steel gates that lead to the small front yard and the stairway of the building.

But even the residential second and third floors show no signs of life. Climbing to the top, the locked grilled-gate to the roof is reached. Standing there, one cannot help but shudder, imagining what had happened there on April 27, 2012.|1

For three turbulent centuries, the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into our hearts. For many, that sight still resonates to this day. But when it was announced in 2009 that Sir Richard Branson (founder of Virgin Galactic) plans to launch his private space tourism company by 2018, there was much rejoicing across the globe for the British entrepreneur.
