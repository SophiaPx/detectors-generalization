To most NBA experts, players and fans, Kobe Bryant is one of the top 20 best players of all time and one of the top five guards the league has ever produced. To some, he is second only to Michael Jordan and to a third, out there, group he is the best of all time. To get the first group of people to consider agreeing with the second (I leave out the third because nobody seriously believes that is ever possible), Kobe Bryant has to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a championship this season.|1
"MILLERSBURG -- If laughter really is the best medicine , then the people who turned out for the inaugural Standup for Kids benefit comedy night on Saturday at the Millersburg Fire Hall have been given an amazing cure.

"The right sheet set and pajamas can help you stay cool. Today’s memory-foam mattresses don't sleep as ""hot"" as older models did, thanks to air-circulating layers and ventilated toppers that keep the foam from absorbing and retaining all your body heat. But a certain insulating effect is unavoidable when you're sleeping on a foam block. If your memory foam mattress leaves you sweating at night, a few remedies can help turn down the heat -- if only by a few degrees. Anything you can do to distance your body from the memory foam will help keep you cool."|1

Many Alberta small-business owners, who have been struggling through a prolonged economic downturn, are hoping the next provincial government will bring relief through business-friendly policies. The Alberta election is April 16 and polls suggest that Rachel Notley’s ruling New Democrats will be replaced with Jason Kenney’s United Conservatives, which have campaigned to scrap the carbon tax and loosen some labour rules that have driven up business costs. Over the past two years, small-business confidence in Alberta has reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the country, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which has been tracking the measure for about 20 years.|1
The Jawbone Up debuted last year with big ambitions: A bracelet-like device that you'd wear all the time, tracking how much you move and how well you sleep. Paired with an app, the Up helps you recognize patterns in your habits, empowering you to improve your health. One problem: It wasn't built to withstand the punishment of being a wearable device. Unlike a cellphone that resides in your pocket or a bag, the Up wraps around your wrist, exposed to the world just as much as your skin is. Many users found it quickly malfunctioned, and Jawbone recalled the Up and issued refunds.|1
"Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “ Thank You ” rally was the crowd ’ s reaction when Obama told the crowd he wanted them to “ go out and register more people to vote .”
The crowd responded by giving him a standing ovation. But this is exactly how Obama has gotten elected and re elected . His “ grass root ” organization is a fraud . Everybody in the crowd was paid and given free transportation and free housing and free food for the whole two weeks of the campaign . In some cases they were given as much as two thousand dollars in spending money ."|0
LITCHFIELD , Maine ( AP ) — A Maine woman is trying to protect a series of osprey nests atop cell phone towers with a device that mimics the sound of an osprey chick. The Bangor Daily News reports 23-year-old Samantha Wood of Litchfield says the chick distress calls are working because the ospreys have returned each year to the same nests, which are protected from predators by an enclosure. She says she began the project in 2012, when cell phone company Verizon asked her to find a way to protect some ospreys from their nests being destroyed.|0

Last week, we learned that the Obama administration is considering other alternatives to stop foreclosures. Today, we have some color on what one of these efforts might look like. It would encourage servicers to reduce struggling borrowers' mortgage balance. Although banks have fought such efforts in the past, it seems that the program could benefit everyone involved. And the best part: it wouldn't take any taxpayer dollars. Of the residential mortgage-backed securities outstanding, about $1.3 trillion are so-called private label notes that were issued by banks and other financial institutions, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.|1

GoldMoney founder James Turk interviews When Money Dies author Adam Fergusson , who discusses the parallels and differences between the 1920s and today. Fergusson explains how German inflation worked, and how it was caused by an increase in the money supply and a shortage of goods. He notes how the Reichsbank printed money to pay its debts to the US and to keep its own costs low, while consumers were driven to buy whatever they could before prices increased further, causing demand to boom. The situation today is much the same says Fergusson, with governments printing money to buy their way out of economic trouble.|0
The J. C. Penney Company, the fourth-largest United States retailer, said today that September sales at stores open at least a year were falling short of expectations, prompting several analysts to cut fiscal third-quarter earnings estimates.

Penney's same-store sales may decline as much as 5 percent this month, they said. The company's goal was to increase sales as much as 4 percent.|1

An extra $190,000 in state special education reimbursement funding that came in late last month has helped the town pay off its nearly half million-dollar settlement with the district's bus drivers union, officials said this week. Together with around $300,000 in savings found in the district's fiscal 2011 budget, the money has covered the town's $497,000 obligation to the drivers, whose jobs have been outsourced to a private busing company. The additional special education money, part of the state's circuit breaker program, will prevent the town from having to carry the debt over into fiscal 2012, officials said.|1

Can You Keep a Secret ? is based on Sophie Kinsella ’ s 4-million-copy New York Times bestseller and centers on a high-strung New York attorney, Emma Corrigan (Lively), who is smack-talked by her boss. She gets drunk, and blurts out some not-so-nice statements about everyone at the office party, and she accidentally e mails the confidential list of people she named, to all the people she named. This is not a comedy. There is no laughter. It is just a painful look at one person’s life, told by herself.|0
Clinton said this week paid family leave is possible by taxing the wealthy but states have done so without soaking the rich. In her opening statement at the first Democratic debate Tuesday, Hillary Clinton mentioned the need for paid family leave, and when asked about it later, she said it was possible to pay for it by having the wealthy foot the bill. The line may be good fodder for Democrats, but looking at how states have done it, as well as current national proposals, show other ways to pay for the policy without soaking the rich.|1
The ease of Manchester United ’ s win over Premier League title rivals Chelsea masked a potential moment of controversy. Losing 2-0 against the Blues is one thing – conceding the two goals in such questionable circumstances is a different kettle of fish entirely. The Red Devils were beaten at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, courtesy of a Willian goal that was clearly offside before a Marcos Alonso free-kick was allowed to stand. Both the assistant and the on-pitch VAR official had no hesitation in awarding the goals in a match that was always going to be difficult to win.|0

When Pacers coach Frank Vogel announced he would sit all five starters for last night's game against the Bucks, it was like a thought experiment come to life. Can a good team's second unit beat the starters of a historically awful team? It was close, but...yes! The game was an exciting one, if only from a theoretical standpoint: You desperately wanted to see what would happen, but not necessarily actually watch it go down. Because this wasn't Copeland and Solomon Hill and C.J. Watson getting meaningful minutes in just any late-season game—this game mattered.|1

One minute he was strutting around the end zone , staring into the stands , the look of a stone-cold slayer on his face. Then he was back to being the same guy you know, the same guy you saw on Monday, or Saturday, or whenever you last saw him. He wasn’t wearing an expression of victory or glory. He wore a look of confusion, maybe shock.

You have to give Square Enix points for honesty ; Bravely Default : For the Sequel wears its primary intentions firmly upon its sleeve. This is not, nor is it aiming to be, a traditional RPG.

But it also contains elements of RPGs like Star Ocean or Final Fantasy. This is a strange mix and in a way it feels like the game was made by a committee.|0

Millions of refugees have fled their homes in war-torn Syria since 2011 . President Barack Obama previously planned to resettle 65,000 refugees in the US. Now, President Trump's administration has slashed that goal in half. Trump has said his administration is focusing on taking care of the people of America first. But immigrant rights advocates say the cuts will affect people fleeing persecution who are not dangerous. So, if 50,000 immigrant visas are issued, how are they divided amongst the different categories of visas? And what are the implications for the millions of Syrians and other refugees fleeing war, persecution, and violence abroad?|0
Could Washington state elect the greenest governor in the nation?

A former top U.S. diplomat in the Obama administration told lawmakers Tuesday that President Trump’s first phone call in office to Ukrainian President Zelensky was “inappropriate,” and suggested Trump’s decision to hold up military aid to the country was “dangerous and unacceptable.”

Holwell Sports reached their first Senior County Cup final in 17 years on Tuesday evening after a penalty shoot-out win over Heather St Johns. John Webster’s side raced into an early two-goal lead but were left hanging on through 90 minutes and then extra time as Heather fought back to level. A nerveless and clinical display then won them the shoot-out 4-1 as Holwell booked their place in the final against Leicester Road on Tuesday, May 2. Assistant manager Andy Hill said: “I thought Heather were a very good footballing side, and it was a hard-fought win for us rather than a brilliant performance.|1

It was a bountiful year for books in English by Quebec writers. Ian McGillis looks back at some of his favourites. Putting together a Lucky 13 piece on 2016’s best books in English by Quebec writers, the thought recurs that there were years, not so long ago, when getting a list up to this count could be a challenge. Now, it’s a matter of cutting it down — agonizingly, painfully. Apologies, then, to the many books and writers — some of them featured in these very pages over the past year — who don’t appear below.|1
Sunkett said the running back positions are still up from grabs and that the ground attack will be by committee, at least early in season. A young East St. Louis defensive unit gave up a lot of points a year ago. With three starters returning on the defensive line, a group of strong and quick linebackers and a secondary, which will be led by Thomas, the Flyers should be better this fall. Gone up front is all-American defensive end Terry Beckner Jr . — now at the University of Missouri — but LaMontre’ Harvey, Antuan Quinlin and Terres Lagrome, are quick agile linemen who return.|1

Plushenko’s glorious career was finished. He had hoped to cap it at home after a comeback from spinal surgery, which he did, partially, by helping Russia win the team competition. But his 31-year-old back, after all those years of wrenching revolutions and hard landings, gave out two nights too soon. In essence, Plushenko sacrificed his chance at another individual medal to put his country on top. He was a longshot for gold, but in a sport of sequins and stuffed animals, he brought pugnacious sizzle. He was the James Cagney of the ice.|1

It has seemed for a while as though the global financial storm was going to deal a mostly glancing blow to Canada. The government of the United States has taken some drastic steps to stem the crisis by buying equities and increasing liquidity through lower interest rates. But on Tuesday, the Canadian markets took a major hit and have continued to fall on the following days, with the markets now down almost 15 per cent since September. There are a number of reasons that Canadian financial markets would be negatively impacted by an American financial crisis.|0

WASHINGTON — Thousands of commuters across the region were delayed Thursday morning by an apparent work action by Metro ’s rail operators’ union. At the height of the disruption, trains were operating at roughly half the usual speed, Metro said on its Web site, and some were operating with only a single car. Metro’s chief executive, Richard Sarles, was quoted by The Washington Post as saying that the delays were the result of operators purposely slowing trains. At the Federal Aviation Administration, officials were forced to relocate employees temporarily.|0

Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child’s play, thanks to MIT. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a parser that imitates kids’ learning processes by observing the environment and making connections. The system studies captioned videos and learns to associate words with objects and actions. When given a new sentence, the parser can accurately predict its meaning—without visual clues. This “weakly supervised” approach, which requires limited training input, could expand the types of data and reduce the effort needed for training parsers. Annotations can certainly speed up the process, but they’re not needed to learn.|1
This week , in a closed-door meeting of Congressional Democrats with President Obama , Representative Ed Perlmutter of Colorado bluntly told the president that there was no way his party’s candidates could win a majority in either the House or the Senate unless the president took a much tougher approach toward Republicans, especially if they refused to agree to increase the federal minimum wage. “The bottom line is this: If we don’t take back the House, the only way we’re going to get it done is when we get a presidential signature,” Perlmutter said.|0

It seems that this GoPro accessory for the Hero 4 and 5 Black isn’t on the radar at all. The reason is because it was released in Japan in August 2015.|0

A new study for The New York Times reveals that the media pay for the top 200 CEOs is now $14.5 million. This is up 55 in the last year. While any one CEO may be well worth his/her raise, it is a growing political and PR problem for corporate America to be seen as rewarding those at the top, with little consideration for actual performance. For millions of Americans who are unemployed, under employed and being foreclosed on, it seems inconceivable that corporate CEOs can be getting significant raises at a time of such economic hardship.|1

Media & Entertainment I write about women in the business of Hollywood . New research released today from the Geena Davis Institute shows that women and people of color are not only underrepresented on screen but that gender disparity has become more severe over the last two decades, particularly in popular genres like action, fantasy and adventure. The study, which looked at 118 top films released between 2010 and 2015 , found that women comprised 31% of all major characters. In top-grossing films (films which grossed over $300 million), women accounted for 34%, while men made up 66% of all main characters.|0
My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors. For example, consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron, or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one. Each of these cells, (if taken from the same individual) has an identical genome — and yet each is “reading” a very distinct subset of that genome and consequently carrying out very different behaviors. The choice of what to read and what to hide away is made during development.|1

They let customers and suppliers know that at midnight, they could deliver, buy, and drink beer at the brewery once again. The local business managed to survive 13 years.|1

Where do we begin to try to describe this restaurant? Probably the best place is first to apologize for keeping this secret to ourselves for such a long time. We have agonized over whether to publicize this jewel, and have finally decided it really is our responsibility to share this fantastic place with you. So what makes this such a special find? After all, there are some delightful restaurants in Bratislava, and this gastronomic oasis is 140 kilometers away. Why should we encourage you to take this drive? Simply, it is a combination of the people, the food, and the service.|1
"From Madonna to Sam Smith , Taylor posed with everyone ! As was made evident in Taylor Swift 's introductory video for the 57th Annual GRAMMYs , it seems as though the pop singer has a knack for befriending celebrities. The song is about a ""boy who doesn't think he'll ever be in love"", so perhaps it's a love song written from the perspective of her new husband. ""It's very important to us that our story is told from our perspective"", the Kardashian told Entertainment Tonight last year ."|0
STARSPORT brings you the latest transfer news and gossip from Upton Park . West Ham have had a club-record £31m bid accepted for Valencia starlet Paco Alcacer. The 22-year-old attacker has scored 33 goals in just 65 appearances for Valencia since breaking into their first-team in 2011.

Boeing ’ s latest setback , a deal between Tesla and Fiat Chrysler , and Pinterest ’ s valuation were some of the topics on our minds this week at Barron’s Advisors. The Chicago-based company said its fourth-quarter earnings would be lower than expected following two recent crashes of its new 737 Max jet. The stock plunged about 12% in premarket trade, but the market reaction is an overreaction because the plane is only 0.4% of Boeing’s revenue, said Barron’s. The electric-car maker and FCA said Tuesday they will partner to produce a zero-emissions truck and SUV in five years’ time.|0

Pennsyltucky (2-to-1) is a 3-year-old who was second in his only other race at Laurel last month, and will be trying two turns for the first time in his career, and that is why he’s the second choice. Also in the field are two horses that won last time out at Pimlico. The one who won by 14 lengths is a newcomer for trainer Graham Motion and is making only his second start.|0
"The British are known for their collective stiff upper lip . The elements of British style translate easily in everyday life. Here is a small list of pieces that make the English style timeless and easy to wear, and how to style them. Mary Janes :
First of all, the Mary Jane is an American shoe that was first made by the Boston Shoe company in the 1870s. It was given the name of Mary Jane after a stage name of one of the first celebrities. This shoe became fashionable for women in the 20s. It is still worn by young children today."|0
Labour leader Ed Miliband doesn't have an image problem, he has a policy problem. The problem is he doesn't have any, or at least policies that answer the gravity of the situation. Millions of people suffer as inflation outstrips wages. The cost of food, transport, fuel and housing skyrocket. A million people have visited food banks. This is not only a joyless recovery, for the vast majority of people it's a moneyless one. A smirking George Osborne may don a hi-vis jacket and march through building sites in Northern England to boast of recovery.|1
Why do we only hear about Jasper Johns when he gets ripped off? Jasper Johns is the greatest artist alive. It seems a shame that he only enters the headlines when people rip him off. Johns was in court this week to give evidence against a Queens, New York foundry owner, Brian Ramnarine, who has now pleaded guilty to faking one of the artist's works. It was a bronze version of one of the most iconic of all American paintings: Flag. Johns had made four bronze copies of Flag in 1960 at Ramnarine's foundry.|1
London ( AP ) — An iceberg four miles wide has broken off from a glacier in eastern Greenland and scientists are racing to determine whether it could threaten a nearby village that is home to about 175 people. A NASA satellite captured a view of the huge iceberg Tuesday, the same day villagers in the town of Innaarsuit reported a big, blue iceberg just off their shore. It is still 18 miles away and does not pose any immediate threat, Greenland police said Tuesday. But if it gets too close, it could pose a serious threat, they added.|0
Media & Entertainment I write about women in the business of Hollywood. New research released today from the Geena Davis Institute on Gender and Media shows that we have a long way to go in our depictions of girls and women onscreen in family-friendly movies. It also showed that countries around the world must do a better job of employing women because, when they do, we see more women and girls onscreen. In their previous research, Dr. Stacy L. Smith, Marc Choueiti, & Dr. Katherine Pieper at the USC Annenberg School of Communications, looked at G, PG and PG-13 rated movies that were released in the US.|1

During the 2000 campaign, Davis led the Hurricanes to the Class 4A state semifinal round. He then guided MRA to the title game last year before falling short 14-7 to Tuscaloosa ACA at Legion Field. The two-time Class 4A state champion coach is 13-1 in the state playoffs over the past four years.

Some Zimbabwe government supporters say President Robert Mugabe should form a government without the opposition, following an opposition boycott of talks Monday in Swaziland. Tendai Maphosa asked ordinary Zimbabweans in Harare what they think about this latest threat to the power-sharing deal signed last month and reports for VOA. After failing to agree on the allocation of Cabinet posts last week, Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change decided to refer the matter to the Southern African Development Community. They agreed to meet with SADC representatives earlier this week, but that meeting never took place.|1

"Dan Rather on Trump : `` It 's never been this bad '' '' We 're better than this , damnit. We can 't let it go on! '' ''
( CNN ) Former CBS News anchor Dan Rather has long been a critic of the media. He's criticized journalists as too often failing to challenge what he says is false information from leaders in power. ""There are so many things that the president has said that's just a bald lie that we just kind of shrug at,'' Rather said. But when it comes to Trump, Rather said he sees something different altogether."|0
“Overwatch” was pristine out of the box. The character and level design were excellent. It combined elements of hits “Team Fortress 2” and “League of Legends” to create something completely new. But for a multiplayer game to have any longevity, it needs to consistently improve and add new content. 20 millionBlizzard announced in October that “Overwatch” had hit 20 million players in its first five months. “Overwatch” took a step back in late June when it unveiled a deeply flawed competitive mode, but it rallied the following month.|1
ARSENE WENGER last night confessed he passed up the chance to buy Didier Drogba – for just £100,000! The Arsenal boss could have landed the super striker seven years ago, while he was playing for lowly French outfit Le Mans in the French Second Division. But Wenger stressed he was not the only manager to snub a player who went on to join today’s FA Cup semi-final opponents Chelsea for £24m two years later. “Don’t forget all the French clubs watched him,” he pointed out. “Nobody took him.

Two years ago, Red Sox prospect Ryan Westmoreland seemed to be on the fast track to the majors. The Portsmouth native, who the Sox selected in the fifth round of the 2008 draft, got off to a blazing start in his professional career in 2009 in Single-A Lowell. In 60 games with the Spinners, the outfielder hit .296 with seven homers and 19 stolen bases, and his five-tool potential helped him quickly ascend up everyone's list of top Red Sox prospects. But all of that changed in a hurry when, in March of 2010, he was diagnosed with a cavernous malformation in his brain.|1
The Volstead Act was repealed on this date in 1933 , returning control of alcohol to the states , and allowing individuals to legally consume alcohol again after a thirteen-year hiatus in the U.S. . It is also the date that Prohibition ended. But that is not the end of the Prohibition story. The “noble expe riment” in the United States lasted from January 16, 1919, to January 20, 1933, when Prohibition was officially repealed by Congress. It all began in the 1840s with what was called the “temperance movement,” the idea that the use of alcohol was a major cause of many social problems.|0

Before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married , the tabloids floated a strange rumour : the couple might elope. They'd be running away to Botswana to be together. It made sense that Harry would go back to Africa, because it was where he'd spent time with his mother, Diana. And because Botswana was where they'd spent their first holiday together after they got engaged , it was a good place for them to get away. But a wedding elope? That was a rumour that didn't seem to make sense.|0
Jack Kerouac cruised the bohemian North Beach neighborhood here in the 1950s intent on achieving nothing less than freedom of the mind, spirit and body. He was not alone in his quest. In the same era, Beat artist Wally Hedrick and his wife, the poet Diana di Prima, arrived from New York City and took up residency. Together, the couple founded the 13th Floor and 6 Gallery as the center of the San Francisco counterculture movement. They were soon joined by fellow artists George Herms, Jess Collins, and Bruce Conner.|0

In the week between Christmas and New Years , Gov . George Pataki signed into law two bills sponsored by state senate majority leader Joe Bruno. The first, a $150,000 pay hike for Bruno's job, has sparked outrage throughout the state, but the other bill has slipped by almost without notice. The bill, numbered S. 1382 of 2001, grants the state the power to exempt itself from any federal mandate that imposes costs or financial burdens on New Yorkers, and it requires that the state pay no cost for compliance. The bill goes on to specifically authorize the state to disregard the 9-11 Act.|0
"Doing business in British Columbia is particularly challenging because of the province ’ s reputation as a hotbed of environmental and labour activists. As one business owner in British Columbia said:
“In B.C. it’s all litigation, no business. I lost a lawsuit for $15 million, so I decided to leave British Columbia. The labour law in Ontario is far more reasonable than in British Columbia; there’s the same problem with the environment. In British Columbia there are no rules.

Hi, National Geographic, it's me, Ryan. I got your package today and I guess I'm wondering - why did you send me a pseudoscientific crystal healing water bottle with your name on it?

Beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl is never easy. When they scored 21 points the first three times they held the ball in the second half and took a 33-32 lead, we all thought the same scary movie we’ve seen since 2001 was replaying before our eyes. But this epic brought a different ending. This one saw Foles, a man of faith who wants to be a pastor when he leaves the game, play as if touched by God. He completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.|1
America is voting Tuesday to fill the country's top job opening. The country also has over five million other jobs waiting for the right candidate. The Labor Department said Tuesday that America had 5.5 million job openings in September, close to the record high of 5.8 million openings set in April. There was even a small increase in federal government job openings. It's a great sign that employers want to hire. However, this huge number of openings also signals that employers can't find the workers with the right skills for the open jobs that they have.|1
We chose to question the narrative of history by simply quoting words which Churchill used himself. At a glance, Blighty Café appears to be another one of those trendy and sophisticated coffee shops that offer the terribly appealing combination of tasteful beverages, off-beat music and the inviting aroma of freshly-baked sourdough bread. As a university student living in the area, of course, I couldn’t resist. Sounds perfect, right? Except, sitting in the mock air-raid shelter, drinking my flat white, I couldn’t help but feel ever more uncomfortable.|1

Geological records indicate that this 9.0 magnitude quake struck around 9 p.m. Jan. 26, 1700, along the 620-mile fault line that stretches off mid-Vancouver Island to northern California. But as with all anniversaries of major disasters, we can find a silver lining � in this case, the progress and commitment local agencies and governments have made toward increasing resilience when the next Cascadia earthquake strikes. Oregon�s offshore seismic fault mirrors the subduction zone that caused the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami that killed thousands of people and destroyed entire villages.|1
Is a roving, body-scanning van a needed surveillance tool or a another step toward eroding personal privacy? Andy Greenberg of Forbes is reporting that American Science & Engineering, which provides x-ray scanners to governments and defense companies, has introduced a van capable of scanning nearby cars.

The U.S. government is charging that Google is systematically paying women less than their male counterparts. Testifying in a San Francisco court Friday, Department of Labor (DOL) regional director Janette Wipper said the government “found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” according to a report in The Guardian. The charges come as part of a lawsuit the DOL filed against Google in January, seeking access to the company’s compensation data and related personnel records. As a federal contractor, Google is required to permit the government to inspect records relevant to its compliance with equal opportunity laws.|1

Who pulled the plug on the canal this time? It’s winter, and we’re certainly not in the middle of a drought, so what’s happened to this stretch of the Grand Union Canal?

How will fuel prices and driving in Europe be affected by Brexit ? Following the momentous decision taken today by the British electorate to exit the European Union (EU) we ask the question: how will it affect fuel prices and how much will UK drivers be hit in the pocket? To answer that question, we must first determine the effect on the Euro and its value. Prior to the referendum, it was predicted that the currency would plunge in value if the UK left. However, following the vote that saw the UK opt out, the currency remained strong at 1.23, which is its highest since 2014.|0

The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep. That is the provocative implication of recent research that examined investors’ financial risk-taking following periods when their sleep was disrupted. I concede that advice to get more sleep is hardly new, since we’ve been hearing that most of our lives — and the advice is honored more in the breach than in the observance. Furthermore, retirees typically would like to sleep more, but can’t — due to the disruptions in sleep patterns that are a normal part of the aging process.|1

This time around, Evans dominated the contest, landing a number of big punches to Ortiz before finishing the fight with a big knee to Ortiz’ sternum that was followed up by a series of punches. The referee was then forced to stop the fight.|1
I’m still not convinced Foreman is the answer — they’d be crazy not to draft a running back next year — but for now Foreman might get goalline work and has speed to do a little more. When Cooper Kupp sustained an ACL tear, the question was whether Reynolds could step into his role as an equal partner in the Rams’ pass-catching triumvirate. He leaped the first hurdle with flying colors: six catches for 80 yards and a score against the Chiefs. The Rams operate out of three-receiver 11 personnel an insane 98 percent of time, per sharpfootballstats.com.|1
Evan Spiegel's once-buzzy company is laying off employees as it cuts back on hiring. Just a few months after its euphoric debut on the public market was stifled by a series of increasingly bleak earnings reports, Snapchat parent company Snap is laying off a handful of employees for the second time this month. Business Insider reports that 18 employees from Snap’s recruiting division have been let go. While those employees represent less than 1 percent of the company’s total headcount, Snapchat also plans to pump the brakes on hiring next year.|1

Some Zimbabwe government supporters say President Robert Mugabe should form a government without the opposition , following an opposition boycott of a meeting with Mugabe. The meeting with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change failed to break an impasse over the allocation of cabinet seats following disputed elections last month. The opposition says it will not join a unity government until electoral and security reforms have been made. The government of President Mugabe, 84, says that conditions cannot be imposed before negotiations begin. In a recent speech , Mugabe suggested that he would be ready to form a one-party government if the MDC did not join a unity administration.|0
It's Memorial Day Weekend, and that means hitting up the best sales, whether at the store or from the comfort of your own home. It also means a ton of cool movies are coming out, like Wes Anderson's latest flick, Moonrise Kingdom (we recently broke down The 10 Most Stylish Wes Anderson Characters). If you're lucky though, you're at the beach. Even if you aren't, that doesn't mean you can't welcome in the summer with a warm weather-approriate kit.

Surgical Strike Day : State Education minister Partha Chatterjee yesterday criticised the central government alleging that the UGC 's direction to hoist the National flag at every educational institution on 29th February was an 'attempt to instill fear in the society'. Chatterjee said such directives were part of the central government's attempt to mislead the society. He added that the Centre was taking every step to instill fear among the students and teachers, which is 'completely undemocratic'. The UGC had recently issued a notice asking all state and central government institutes to 'hoist the national flag on 29th February and observe it with proper solemnity and dignity.|0
In a democracy, it is said, we get the government we deserve. The same can be said of bestselling guru prescriptives. Malcolm Gladwell's new book What the Dog Saw, a compilation of some of his favorite New Yorker pieces, has drawn both praise and criticism. Personally, I'm not a big Gladwell fan. Shoot me. I'm told he's an interesting person. And he knows how to tell a good anecdote. But, at the risk of oversimplifying my critique of his work ... he oversimplifies.|1

If you live along the Eastern Seaboard and wake up early Friday you could be treated to a colorful sky hours before sunrise lights up the horizon. The Terrier-Improved Malumute sounding rocket is scheduled for launch Friday between 4:26 a.m. and 4:41 a.m. ET. Sounding rockets, by the way, have been used for over 40 years to carry science payloads on brief, 5-20 minute missions to space. Friday morning should provide mostly clear skies in the viewing location, and upper level winds should be friendly enough to allow the launch to take place (if not, backup launch dates are available each morning through June 6).|1

In recent years, platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their artistry. For the generation of designers who grew up playing “Super Mario Bros.” platformers offer a sound formula. Though the goal of such games is usually to get from one area to the next, that framework supports copious possibilities. Determining how a character moves through a world and what sorts of things should impede or assist in the process allows plenty of room for creativity. It is why games like “Journey” and “Inside” can both be constructed around jumping avatars but otherwise appear quite distinct.|1

For decades, aid groups have assumed they know what's best for refugees and the poor; a growing body of evidence suggests they're wrong. Both academic research and practical experience, such as with the mass of Syrians fleeing civil war, shows that simply handing out traditional relief goods may not be the most effective way of helping the dispossessed. Aid agencies are tentatively also giving away cash and letting refugees decide for themselves what they need. While the results may be unexpected, the money is being wisely spent and rarely wasted - contrary to old prejudices among donors.|1

An extra $ 190,000 in state special education reimbursement funding that came in late last month has helped the town and school district close their books for fiscal 2009, school officials said.

That will now be postponed until Monday, March 29, to allow for the inclusion of the new revenue. Mr. Ward said he is now recommending spending $ 13.9 million of that total for the school budget.|0
North Korean hacking group focuses attacks on aging and soon-to-be-deprecated technology. Five-Star hackers: High-end hotel data thieves return to target government officials The DarkHotel hacking group has returned -- but this time they're focusing on a different target, using a new strain of Inexsmar malware.

Where do we begin to try to describe this restaurant ? Probably the best place is first to apologize for the poor pictures as the lighting was awful and there were no windows. There are no windows as there is a river running through the bottom of the place so when you go outside to take a leak, its more like going to take a dip. There was a guy playing an accordian as we walked in, and there was one at each table. As we were seated, we were given a huge basket of free bread. This was the bread that was served.|0

JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar : for years the ultra-Orthodox have fought a battle against non-Orthodox groups to protect their domain, and the non-Orthodox have pressed their claim. But the combatants in this round were the Women of the Wall, an organization that for a quarter-century has campaigned for egalitarian prayer at the wall, and some of the women were wearing their hair in short wigs, not the scarves and hats favored by the ultra-Orthodox. “It’s time to show our faces,” Rabbis Susan Silverman and Noa Sattath said.|0
I thought I was an acceptable kind of evangelical. I'm not a fundamentalist. My friends and I enjoy art, alcohol, and cultural engagement. We avoid spiritual clichés and buzzwords. We value authenticity, study, racial reconciliation, and social and environmental justice.

We could disagree about truth, spirituality, and morality, and remain on the best of terms. The failures of the church often made me more uncomfortable than those in the broader culture.|1

But it started even farther back. “It started historically back in Africa with certain tribes using it, and then through slavery as a way of communication, so there’s a lot of call and response,” Darnesha said.|1

Syrian sources said April 14 that the Jordanian charge d'affaires in Lebanon , Hisham Moheisen , who was kidnapped from his car in northern Lebanon the same day, is alive and the abductors have not set any conditions for his release.

Made of Q-Tips , this craft goes far beyond a miniature garland or cake topper . The light strand also looks very nice on a tree branch, hanging down from a shelf, or taped to a window to give the appearance of a twinkling starry night.

The result is a string of tiny twinkling lights that looks very pretty in a Christmas tree. This is a craft that’s great to do with the kiddos, too!|0

I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad’s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should not constantly be called to account for the vicious behaviour of IS. Still less to be stigmatised until unnamed Muslim leaders disowned it. I was disconcerted to see so many Eureka Street readers appeared to agree with the demands against which she protested. Both Ruby’s complaint and the responses to it reminded me of the attitudes taken to Catholics in an earlier generation. The popular charges against Catholics were honed in the Great War and particularly by the referenda on Conscription.|1

Cryptocurrencies, outside of Bitcoin, have failed to garner much attention from buyers, and while the same can be said of sellers, the digestion of losses over the past month is likely to lead to more losses soon. Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin are all carving out a similar bear-flag pattern that should lead to another purge of speculative excesses. Weak price action in ETH/USD has it set up to make another leg lower soon. It could continue to drift ever-so-slightly higher, but the developing bear-flag implies risk is skewed more heavily towards the downside.|1
BANGKOK (Reuters) - The leader of Thailand’s military junta said on Thursday that Yingluck Shinawatra, the prime minister he ousted three years ago, was in Dubai, where she fled last month to avoid being jailed over a rice subsidy scheme that lost billions of dollars.

His remarks came a day after the country’s top court found Yingluck guilty of criminal negligence and sentenced her in absentia to five years in prison.|1

Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of flaws in the way universal credit is designed, campaigners say. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG ) said arbitrary rules built in to the way universal credit is calculated leave some families unable to predict how much they will be paid each month, leaving households in debt and unable to budget. It can lead to claimants being wrongly benefit-capped – a penalty designed to “incentivise” jobless or low-earning households by severely limiting their benefits – because the system fails to spot they are working and earning enough.|1

The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep . That is the provocative implication of a study out this week from the journal Sleep, which found that retirees who are sleep deprived have a 65 percent higher probability of dying in the next 13 years than those who get their recommended eight hours of sleep a night. While this study didn’t prove causality — sleepy seniors may be more prone to die because they have more health problems, for example, or are less likely to exercise — research does show a consistent link between sleep habits and longevity.|0

My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors .

It's hard to imagine that 2001: A Space Odyssey would have its incredible cinematic impact without that classical soundtrack. But director Stanley Kubrick originally hired a composer to score the film, only to abandon the score in postproduction. Kubrick tapped Alex North, who had scored a number of classic films, including Kubrick's own Spartacus, to write the 2001 score. Kubrick deemed the score inadequate for the film, and replaced it with the classical musical tracks that are so familiar today. North wasn't aware of the change until the film premiered.|1

The Brother MFC-J775DW is a low-priced inkjet with very low running costs and a basic feature set for a home-office printer. It prints and copies well and has a good text quality, albeit with slightly heavy blacks. For photo-quality printing, we'd suggest a more expensive model or a laser. Despite a basic set of features, this Brother printer is a great value for the money. Prints well, but at a slow 12.8ppm in black and just 7.2ppm for color, this is a solid printer with an inexpensive ink cartridge that will print many pages, but won't work for large print jobs.|0

"John Bennett(July 20), a teacher at Westside Middle School, was upset by the School Board's decision to have teachers teach all sides of any controversy. He is right, of course, that pretending all sides of any controversy are equally valid is nonsense. But a good deal of the issue hinges on our definition of ""teaching"" a position. If ""teaching"" means that the teacher merely presents all sides of a controversy as though they were equal in weight and legitimacy, then we are being equal time indoctrinists."|1

Nintendo’s ancient Power Glove remains a part of popular culture because, one, it was an epic, ET: The Game-style failure and, two, because it was a power glove.

Cryptocurrencies , outside of Bitcoin , have failed to garner much attention from buyers , and while the same can be said for Bitcoin, it is still the only one that can be used across the globe to buy goods and services with relative ease.

In order for a currency to be used as a medium of exchange between consumers and retailers , the merchant must be able to accept the currency as payment .|0

Amazing interview…I wish I had the chance to catch the late screening with Q&A at Fantastic Fest…Profound love/respect/admiration to the Wachowskis, Tykwer, and you David.

Most people have heard of Scrooge, even if they have never read A Christmas Carol or any other work of Charles Dickens, writes Adrian Hattrell. What is certain is that they have never experienced the story in the form of a folk opera, which is what was presented to Tickhill Music Society by the group calling itself Green Matthews and Guest – which comprised of Chris Green, Sophie Matthews and Jude Rees. The players set the scene with a medley of Victorian carols, music hall songs and folk songs, accompanying themselves on an astonishing range of period instruments, which were variously blown, plucked and squeezed.|1
"What will happen to a living organism placed in a state of quantum superposition? September 22, 2015, 3:24 p.m.
Schrödinger's cat was merely a thought experiment. But now it's going to be tested in real life for the first time. You've probably heard of Schrödinger's cat, a famous thought experiment posited by Erwin Schrödinger that suggested putting a cat in a suspended quantum state where it is simultaneously alive and dead.

In the age of Instagram, food is no longer designed to just be food. It’s a set piece, a lifestyle statement of fantastical hyperbole. So we drink unicorn lattes, eat rainbow bagels, and lick our charcoal-black soft serve in front of neon signs. Food is no longer about eating. It’s about the documentation of unattainable perfection, catching the next ever-illusive meme. Yet in this new wave of food-as-influencer, there is a single, curmudgeonly brand that insists on photographing its dishes on conference room tables, under fluorescent lighting, and from all sorts of unflattering angles.|1

Technology ’ s continuing onslaught , and employees ’ responses to it , will be central issues for the American workforce through the end of the decade and beyond. But while the focus on digital transformation , automation , and artificial intelligence will continue , it is the impact of that transformation on workers that will remain the central question. The answer is a resounding ” yes ” , but there is a catch. Because while technology promises to help people become more productive by automating repetitive tasks , it will also require employees to work in different and often more flexible ways .|0
New Jersey hits day three of its government shutdown Monday over a budget stalemate that's closed state parks — and will likely force the furlough of 35,000 workers. On Sunday, the impasse even inconvenienced Gov. Chris Christie, forcing him to leave a state beach that was on shutdown to the public — but open to his family — because he had to return to Trenton. All nonessential services remained closed as the Republican governor and the Democratic Assembly speaker continued to disagree over Christie's plan for a nonprofit health system that is at the center of the budget dispute.|1

Keep it classy. Cheer. Revel in a rival. And Yankees - keep it brief, a simple ceremony of appreciation.

Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the hard work required to maintain it. Amid the hubbub of shopping centers and the din of traffic from nearby Hwy. 61, the cemetery sandwiched between McDonald's and Tires Plus seems jarringly out of place. Few pause to notice the prim patch of well-tended green, bounded by an iron fence, that holds some of Cottage Grove's earliest pioneers. The cemetery, designated a historic site by the Washington County Historical Society, has ties to the founders of Mars Inc., the giant candy manufacturing company.|1

Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “Thank You” rally was the crowd’s silence when Trump mentioned that everyone should come together. The irony being that his campaign has been anything but unifying, which is why his supporters backed him.

I left Cincinnati tired and disheveled, but perhaps mostly worried about our future.|1

"Crucially though, these guys don't stop at food production. While their commercial services seem to focus on landscaping and food production planning for now, the team is also involved in research on designing low impact, low energy, resilient structures that can withstand future shocks—be they natural storms and other challenges, or man-made disasters such as peak oil.

Chipolo Plus is supposedly the loudest Bluetooth item tracker available today, and its chirpy tune can be heard from a greater distance than other similar trackers. Thanks to some useful new tech, items gone missing around the house or office can announce their locations with chirpy ditties — as long as they have Bluetooth trackers attached and you're close enough to hear the trackers' songs. So can you tell the difference between those dB levels? In my tests, I could indeed hear Chipolo Plus a little bit better than the other trackers, though the difference is subtle.|1

The future leadership of Volkswagen hangs in the balance today as the 20-member board of the troubled and iconic company gathers to decide what to do with its disgraced chief executive Martin Winterkorn.

PARIS -- France could become the latest country to ban the use of underweight fashion models.

Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because their employers are flouting rules over the minimum wage. The failure by some companies to properly pay their staff is a major reason behind the 6.7% rise in benefit claims by households in work, which will cost the taxpayer a record-breaking 20bn this year. Thousands of workers, particularly in the care sector, are being denied access to childcare vouchers, free eye tests and NHS dental treatment as a result of their employers not paying the minimum wage, according to official figures.|0
In developed capitalist democracies , financial , media and energy companies are private enterprises that don ’ t report to the citizens but to their financial shareholders who might not even live in the same country as the corporate headquarters.

Although there’s long been a debate over the accuracy of health information online, many U.S. Internet users aren’t hesitant to use the Web when they want answers to health-related questions.

In recent years , platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their 2.5D art and design skills , and so it is with the latest entry into the genre : “Hollow Knight”. Coming from the indie developer Team Cherry this is one of the most stunningly beautiful games that you will ever see on the Switch. The art style is incredibly unique and I can’t help but feel a strong affinity for this game. The visuals alone make this game worth checking out , but the gameplay will make you stay for its long journey.|0
In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don’t report to presidents. In Russia, things are different. Most of those businesses are majority-state-owned corporations, virtual branches of the government. And that means when you talk to the head of a Russian bank or oil company, you are effectively talking to the Kremlin. In 2000, when Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency, he consolidated competing power centers — media, business, local government, opposition parties and the Parliament — under his authority. He called it “a vertical of power.” This system now includes organized crime and cybercriminals.|1
In December 2013, INSYS received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which notified the company of the commencement of an investigation by the DOJ’s Civil Division into the company’s sales and commercial practices and resulted in the company’s corresponding public disclosure.

And with a good smartphone camera and the right camera app, the tools are in everyone's hands.

The newest entry to the robo-advisory service is TIAA . Part of the allure for firms is to appeal to young people who are used to the ease of app-based banking. And, while TIAA has a very large pool of assets to draw from, it may be the least likely company to create such an offering. In fact, it’s the only company in the space that is actually a bank. Betterment has become the leader in the robo-advising space by having the most sophisticated algorithm available. However, it has yet to release a 401(k) or other retirement vehicle.|0
"That's how I would characterize my minimal pre-service time. Fortunately and unfortunately though, I had very little time before my theoretical learning and my practical experience collided. Teaching was a second career and since I was a young twenty something with a rent, I couldn't afford to do all of my learning before I got into the classroom. Back in those days it was called ""alternative route."" The wisdom was to place an extremely green teacher in a high-need school with a mentor and let them learn on the job rather than with a traditional program."|1

The plan is aimed at helping stabilize neighborhoods while also helping to prevent the further decline in the value of vacant homes .

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Democrat John Edwards endorsed former rival Barack Obama on Wednesday, a move designed to help solidify support for the party’s likely presidential nominee even as Hillary Rodham Clinton refuses to give up her long-shot candidacy. The endorsement came a day after Clinton defeated Obama by more than 2-to-1 in the West Virginia primary. The loss highlighted Obama’s challenge in winning over the “Hillary Democrats” — white, working-class voters who also supported Edwards in significant numbers before he exited the race in late January.

BATON ROUGE—Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin is warning voters to be aware of who they discuss their private information with in light of a potential voter registration scam that surfaced this week.

This hybrid workforce is coming to life thanks to businesses that recognize the transformative potential in automation and AI. In a study by Genpact of 300 C-suite and senior executives, 79% of AI leaders – the companies generating impact from AI – expect their employees to be comfortable working alongside robots by 2020.|1

We chose to question the narrative of history by simply quoting words which Churchill used himself . At a glance the viewer will understand the context, but then will question its relevance. The word ‘black’ appears three times, but is outnumbered by other colour references; is it a deliberate attempt to portray a balanced history? Does it hint at the racist undertones in Churchill’s speeches, his attitude towards the Indian nationalist movement for independence? Is his view of ‘coloured peoples’ limited? The viewer is not told what words are spoken where, so the voice of the speaker is lost.|0

McALLEN — School district trustees and top officials met with the local citizens league Thursday to cover the upcoming Tax Ratification Election proposal that will more than likely be put before the board next month.

The feud between California and the Trump administration grows as the president visits the California-Mexico border to inspect wall prototypes. James Schwab said he resigned because he could not maintain mischaracterizations made by Sessions that some 800 undocumented immigrants evaded ICE arrest in February after Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf issued a public warning about imminent ICE operation in the Bay Area. Last week, while visiting Sacramento to announce a Department of Justice (DOJ) lawsuit against California’s policies that protect immigrants from deportation, Session addressed the Oakland immigration raids. “Those are 800 wanted criminals that are now at large in that community,” Sessions said.|1

"The proposal that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to stem migration is nothing but 'hipster' colonialism. Last week, Germany's Africa Commissioner Gunter Nooke said that European countries should be allowed to lease land and to build and run cities in Africa as a means of stemming what he views as the unchecked expansion of migration from Africa to Europe. For Nooke, allowing the ""free development"" of these areas would stimulate African economies and create ""growth and prosperity"" and therefore, reduce the attractiveness of Europe as a destination for migration. The proposal has elicited mixed reactions."|1
A syrah lover finds hope in the Northwest, but sticks to his guns about the failure of many to reach their potential. Several weeks back, I wrote a column about syrah, in which I asserted that this great if temperamental varietal has tremendous potential, but along its journey from grape to wine often gets lost, mugged or tired. You hope and hope and hope, too frequently arriving at disappointment. Syrah is like soccer: 90 loping minutes of play for a final score of 2-1. I love watching soccer, and I love following syrah.|1

Boulder has sued the fossil fuel companies. Probably 15 percent or so of us would be alive today without fossil fuels since without them we would be living in the Middle Ages without medicines, electricity, real sanitation, etc. Those of us who did not die in childbirth or by an infection caused by a scratch could enjoy living a short life behind an animal pulling a wooden plow. Maybe it would be best if we recognize that fossil fuels had their role, evolve our power supplies to renewable, storable resources, and stop demonizing everyone.|1

So, what’s next after all of the early NBA free agency buzz? Nothing like what’s happened so far, one would think.

The five-storied 'Farhad Mansion' resembles any other well-maintained house in an affluent neighbourhood of Chittagong city. Yet no gatekeeper guards any of the two steel gates that lead to the small front yard and the stairway of the building. With the summer holidays, it is not surprising that the ground and fourth floors that house an English medium school are deserted. But even the residential second and third floors show no signs of life. Climbing to the top, the locked grilled-gate to the roof is reached. Standing there, one cannot help but shudder, imagining what had happened there on April 27, 2012.|1

The first image of Earth from lunar orbit. Before an Apollo-era NASA could launch a few humans on top of a rocket and plop them down on the moon, it needed to find safe places to land. So from 1966 through 1967, the space agency launched five spacecraft, which it creatively named Lunar Orbiters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Lunar Orbiter 1 was the first to swing around the moon. It automatically took film photos, processed and scanned them, then beamed the images back as radiowaves to receivers on Earth, where technicians recorded them onto analog data tapes.|1

But the question is: Can he still succeed if he has to be the centerpiece of a defense?|0

He stood out with his solid physique, and soft intense face. However, the moment he spoke, his struggles became obvious. While talking, he would suddenly push out a breathy deep, ""UHH...UHH,"" which came every three of four words. It was a severe stutter problem. He had enrolled in my speech class to hopefully be able to speak better."|1

For three turbulent centuries, the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into the hearts of medieval Europeans. Indeed, the Viking Age, from A.D. 800-1100, was the age of the sleek, speedy longship. Without this crucial advance in ship technology, the Vikings would never have become a dominant force in medieval warfare, politics, and trade. With their invention of the longship, the Vikings spurred a literal sea change in medieval European affairs. The drekar, or dragon-headed longships, were stealthy troop-carriers.|1
The Geo Quiz has an American culinary twist this time. The city we want you to name was named after a French city, located on the banks of the Loire River. Its American counterpart is on the Mississippi. There's a lot of French and Cajun influence there. You can see it in the city's architecture, and taste it in its distinctive cuisine. But the food in this city is more than just crawfish etoufee' and beignets. Spanish, Italian, Native American and African culinary traditions are also part of the stew in this melting pot of flavors.|1

Fast bowler Matt Hobden has been tipped for a bright future as he bids to bounce back from one of the darkest days in his fledgling career. Hobden’s encouraging start to the season came to a grinding halt in the previous Championship match against Middlesex at Hove. The 22-year-old from Eastbourne lost his rhythm completely as he committed 11 no-balls in 16 overs in the first innings and another three in the second. His struggles were highlighted by an injury to Ajmal Shahzad on the opening day which prevented skipper Ed Joyce from withdrawing him from the attack.|1
There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams 's performances that could , roughly , be called his American and his English side. The former tended to be fast, nervy, wired up and aggressive; the latter was more relaxed, self-aware and observational , even when it was playing some kind of craziness. The first is what you see in movies like Aladdin , The Fisher King, Insomnia , and of course, Good Will Hunting . The second comes through in movies such as Dead Poets' Society, Good Morning Vietnam , and of course, Dead Again .|0
"The hyperloop train is leaving the station – and the UK must be on it | City A.M. Steve Norris says high speed rail will cost a small fortune and will not be completed until the early 2040s. If the UK is to remain a first-class player in the global economy then the government needs to get moving on the future of travel, not least the high-speed rail network. But this is no ordinary railway – it is the next-generation transport system that is going to transform our travel experience and, crucially, our commuting time."|0
While it’s not the most glamorous construction project, the state Department of Transportation says it’s something that needs fixing. No, we’re not talking about something on the scale of four Route 8/25 bridges in Bridgeport that were demolished and erected over just one summer. It’s the replacement of old sign supports that hold up those large green signs that direct us at intersections and exits. “The new sign supports are necessary because the old sign supports have reached the end of their life expectancy. The new supports will comply with the latest state and federal standards,” DOT says.|1

The AKP should take comfort in its large majority and start to view minority views and even peaceful dissent benignly, not with suspicion and apprehension. In recent days the ruling AKP has made a number of overtures and concessions to its opponents. The AKP has been forced to recognize that its opponents, like the rest of the Turkish population, are not to be ignored. It is also evident that the current AKP is not as strong as in the past and it cannot rule from the sidelines the way it did before.|0

"You may remember Gary Coleman, the child actor from the 1970s show ""Diff'rent Strokes."" Coleman died on May 28, 2010, in Provo, Utah, from an intracranial hemorrhage. There is much that can be learned from Coleman's less-than-perfect estate plan. However, to understand where Coleman went wrong, some context is needed. Coleman, like many child actors, had a very sad and tragic life. After ""Diff'rent Strokes"" ended its successful eight year run, Coleman sued his parents for misappropriating millions of dollars in his trust fund."|1
"The thorny question of abortion rights is again taking center stage on Beacon Hill and putting some top officials in an uncomfortable spot, chief among them Gov. Charlie Baker. This week Baker, a Republican who supports abortion rights, celebrated the signing of a bill approving $8 million to offset the potential loss of federal funding to women's reproductive health organizations under a new Trump administration rule. That rule, dubbed a ""gag rule"" by critics, would prohibit federally funded family planning clinics from making abortion referrals or sharing office space with abortion providers."|1

There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams's performances that could, roughly, be called his American and British sides. On the American side, there was the slushy tendency towards sentimentality, for which he became increasingly known, which, at its best, resulted in Dead Poets Society, The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire, and, at its worst, became Patch Adams and Old Dogs. Hollywood has long had a tendency to adopt the finest and most interesting comedians and then determinedly blunt the hard edges that make them interesting. Along with Richard Pryor, Williams was the most obvious example of that.|1

Everybody hurts when markets go into free fall (and, as we're writing this on Wednesday afternoon, the Dow Jones has just closed down another 189 points -- although, as always, it could be up 500 points again by the time you read this).

A pair of districts in the Midwest will add Muslim women to the ranks of the US Congress for the first time, CNN has projected. Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party’s nominee, will secure their respective seats in strongly Democratic districts following primary victories earlier this year that effectively decided their races. Omar, in addition to being one of the first Muslim women in Congress, will also be the first Somali-American member. She came to the US more than two decades ago as a refugee. Tlaib actually campaigned with Omar ahead of the latter’s primary race earlier this year.|1
Iqbal Survé’s Sagarmatha Technologies, which failed to list on the JSE a year ago, has set its sights on an offshore listing, according to Survé’s newspaper Business Report. Sagarmatha, a technology company within the Sekunjalo investment group, has already made an application to the SA Reserve Bank, the publication said, citing Survé, the chair of Independent Media. In early 2018, Sagarmatha’s listing on the JSE — along with a mooted listing in New York — was scuppered by its failure to submit financial statements on time.|1

Amazon.com's purchase of Austin-based Whole Foods Market is showing up in the wine category. As this year ends, Amazon has shut down Wine.Woot and its own wine marketplace in favor of Whole Foods' expansive wine operation. Now that Amazon owns Whole Foods, a licensed seller of wine, it comes under different state laws and can't sell directly from a producer. As a result, Dallas entrepreneur Matt Rutledge sees an opening in the marketplace. When Amazon.com purchased daily deals site Woot.com, based in Carrollton, in 2010 it also acquired Wine.Woot, a direct producer-to-consumer website that Amazon adopted for its own wine marketplace.|1

Following a team of international scientists, this film exclusively documents an archeological sensation: the exploration of royal tombs beneath the ancient Mexican city of Teotihuacán. Despite many decades of research, not much is known about the long-lost Teotihuacán society. But when archeologists enter the newly discovered burial chambers, they find the clues that may finally tell us who these mysterious people were. The film incorrectly states the city of Tikal is in Mexico when it is in Guatemala. Secrets of the Dead strives to get the facts correct and we regret the error.|1

Over the next few months, many federal employees will receive performance ratings. Some may believe their ratings to be unreasonably low. What can be done? There is a review process for most employees, but that process generally functions within the agency’s control (with exceptions for bargaining unit employees and successful equal employment opportunity complainants) and is often criticized as being unfriendly to complaining employees. Nonetheless, an appeal might be successful if an employee is careful, thorough and able to strike the right notes. Appeals take numerous forms. Following is a summary of different groups of employees and how the processes may differ.|1

JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar: for more than two decades, women have been making a monthly pilgrimage to pray at one of Judaism’s holiest sites in a manner traditionally preserved for men, and the police have stopped them in the name of maintaining public order. But after a flurry of arrests this fall that set off an international outcry, the women arrived for December’s service to find a new protocol ordered by the ultra-Orthodox rabbi who controls the site.|1
Tim Hortons and an association representing some of its frustrated franchisees are close to reaching a settlement in two class-action lawsuits that could cost the coffee chain millions of dollars. The two sides confirmed on Tuesday they’re close to reaching a deal. The lawsuits claim Tim Hortons, a Canadian company, has used misleading advertising to inflate perceptions of its iconic status as a home-grown coffee chain. There are more than 4,400 Tim Hortons locations worldwide, and about 3,700 of those are in Canada, where most of the allegations in the lawsuit have been made, though some of the claims apply to locations outside of the country.|0
One wonders which of the two best reflects the reality in Sussiya. Yossi Melman wants to know how to stop a terrorist operating on his own (“How to stop a lone wolf,” Analysis, July 18). The answer? You have to be winning a war, not losing it, so that the lone wolf sees he is on the losing side.

For now, though, I would like to focus on an animal that I have always admired. This is the honey badger.|0

"Judy Watson watched as the California Poppy Reserve was established in the 1970s just five miles from her home. She was looking forward to cherishing its vistas forever. But today Watson is among area residents and nature lovers who fear that the state park's annual blaze of orange blossoms will be overshadowed by ""green"" — energy, that is, in the form of sprawling solar panels and gigantic industrial-size wind turbines. ""The whole area will be changed forever,"" said Watson, 70, who lives in Kings Canyon at the base of verdant Portal Ridge."|1
Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the need to preserve these sacred places for future generations. Located in the middle of the small town of Rice Lake, Wis., Oak Ridge Cemetery was established in 1882, the year the Great Northern Railroad came through the town. This cemetery contains the final resting places of many of the founding fathers of the village, as well as other prominent Rice Lake residents.

When I opened the brown clasp envelope and pulled out the 21-page spiral book, I was startled. Dr. Jones is not a pianist. I’ve been having a good laugh at myself about it these last few weeks.

The election is wide open, pitting Islamists against men who served under deposed leader Hosni Mubarak.

Beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl is never easy . When they scored 21 points the first three times they had the ball, I was thinking, ‘This could be one of ‘Those’ Super Bowls.’ You know the ones where there’s no hope for victory at half-time. But I have to say I’m so proud of this team for coming back in the second half. They played the game the right way. No penalties, no stupid mistakes. The Patriots got a lot of breaks in the second half so it was nice that the Rams got some of their own.|0

Will an upcoming vote in Congress signal the end of Medicare? In the next few weeks Congress will decide whether to cut $54 billion in overpayments to Medicare insurers, igniting a battle that may well determine whether the program survives. On one side are Medicare supporters, who want it to continue as a successful social insurance program. On the other is the insurance industry, which is spending millions and lobbying hard to put Medicare on a fast track to privatization, a goal long sought by fiscal conservatives and their allies in right-wing think tanks.|1
Running errands on your bicycle is a great way to burn calories and get some exercise. When you need something small or you are just checking prices and availability, pedaling to the store can be a pleasant experience if you can find a bicycle-friendly route. Several major shopping locations in the Rogue Valley can be accessed by bicycles without encountering excessive traffic. For example, both the Rogue Valley Mall and the Medford Shopping Center are easily accessible from the Bear Creek Greenway bicycle path. It is somewhat more difficult to ride a bike to the big-box stores along Highway 62 (Crater Lake Highway).|1

When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher, only the deepest, most corrosive cynicism is possible. Trampling on the rights of others for political advantage was the modus operandi of Adelaide's Nomenclature Committee in 1837. Western Buddhism and Pentecostalism are sometimes criticised as self-indulgent forms of religion. Is Bishop Spong's Christian humanism any different? The press coverage of Iraq’s surprise victory in the Asian Cup final was — as Ernst Bloch might have put it — full of utopian sentiment. The win was, admittedly, a remarkable achievement, but one that hardly accounted for the sheer exuberance of the outpoured emotion that followed.|1
Capital abundance , low interest rates , and high volatility are creating new challenges and opportunities in equity markets . In this article , we examine how these dynamics have shaped equity markets through history and what the future may hold. Capital abundance has a direct impact on equity valuations. The recent run-up in equity valuations has many observers wondering if valuations have gotten too high. Our analysis suggests that , in the short term , equities may have limited room to run in absolute terms. On the other hand , stocks appear cheap relative to other asset classes and to historical averages .|0
Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child ’ s play , thanks to MIT . Researchers at the school have found an approach that can train a model to speak and understand English sentences in a matter of weeks, rather than a matter of years. The new approach could help in the development of personal assistants and other devices that help people communicate through speech, the researchers say, as it allows the model to learn how to translate questions into coherent spoken statements. The AI system first learns to read sentences of written text and translate that text into phrases that it can understand.|0

Planting the Savannah grasses in front of Cary Home seemed like a good idea in 2013 , when they received a grant of £800 from the National Trust, which they put towards the work. But they were wrong.

If you are a soda drinker unable to decide between healthier homemade sodas and your favorite off-the-shelf Coke , the solution is a simple glass bottle with a homemade carbonation kit and a bit of time. The bottled beverage industry in the US has been dominated by only a handful of companies, but with more people seeking organic and homemade foods and drinks, the time may have come to bring home soda making again. The ingredients for carbonated beverages are very simple. Carbonated drinks are made with carbonated water, sugar or some form of sweetening, and sometimes fruit juice.|0
i really like this guy! Bookmarked for when i have a bit more time Dande. Clinton & Obama supporters . . . you're happy with bombing countries, but banning them from entering the U.S.A. . . The logic of these people. . . Start focusing on Trump because it's easier for Jimmy Dore's brain. Will the Democrats ever come to their senses? I don't necessarily mean the voters; but, those in Congress and the DNC. I think that having President Trump is awakening some on the left. So, perhaps it is a good thing to have President Trump in the White House.|1

The NSA spied on Israel despite a US pledge to curtail surveillance of ally states , revealing how the Israelis obtained a key phone number belonging to the head of a Palestinian militant group.

The team that brought you driverless cars and Siri is now fighting a new kind of war on information. In the world of internet memes, Instagram filters, and Photoshop, seeing is no longer believing. Everyone is a photographer or videographer once they have a smartphone in their hands, which often comes equipped with alteration tools already installed. But manipulations that started with cropping and teeth-whitening have spurred into the spread of misinformation. Parkland shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez is pictured ripping up a shooting range target, left.

Although state trademark registration offers fewer benefits than trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, state trademark registration can be a cheap alternative for securing limited trademark rights. Federal trademark registration can run anywhere from several hundred dollars to $3,000, depending on the type of mark being registered and the amount of attorney's fees. On the other hand, many states charge less than $100 to file a trademark application. Keep in mind that state registration will not offer multi-state protection, nationwide priority status, incontestability, a presumption of validity or the ability to file a trademark on an intent to use basis.|1
PENTICTON , British Columbia -- Connor Hellebuyck does n't want to ruffle any feathers , but he 's not planning to back down, either. Sometimes, Hellebuyck believes, NHL goalies put too much importance on wins and losses. That 's especially true if a team 's record is not reflective of its actual performance. The Jets are in a good position to prove that this season. Hellebuyck, a 6-foot-4, 200-pound native of Commerce Township, Mich., posted 44 victories last season. That total is the second-highest in the NHL over the past three seasons, behind only Ben Bishop 's 45.|0

French President Emmanuel Macron wants to invigorate the European Union as a global power and spurn the populist nationalism that threatens to undermine its success. But he knows it requires cooperation with the United States—which makes his strange bedfellow in the White House so crucial to his agenda. This piece originally appeared in the Washington Post. Macron, who at 40 is three decades younger than Trump, disdains the president’s abrasive nature and many of his policies, notably on Iran and climate change. The French president prefers books, ideas and lofty intellectual conversation to the aggressive transactional style embodied by Trump, who favors television over written text.|1

The word hero gets thrown around so much that its use has lost much of the intended impact . Indie authors, however, are in the best place to use the word with authenticity and truth. Indies have created something out of nothing, and that is no small accomplishment. So how did these authors make their success? There are many factors but I want to point out three things that are very important. First, they wrote a good book. I know that is a given, but many books are not good enough to attract an audience. It is not just about the words.|0

Ryanair has lowered its full year profit guidance from a current range of €1.25-€1.35 billion to a new range of €1.10-€1.20 billion. The decision, which saw shares in the airline fall by more than ten per cent, comes after a turbulent period for the low-cost carrier. The Irish airline was recently hit by a fall in traffic after pilots and cabin crew in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Portugal went on strike. Ryanair has also been forced to lower fares for the third quarter of the year (particularly for the October school half-term holidays and Christmas) as customer confidence has been affected by fear of further strikes.|1
"The hyperloop train is leaving the station – and the UK must be on it | City A.M.
Steve Norris is former Conservative transport minister. Britain can reasonably claim to have invented the railway. Stephenson’s Rocket represented the pinnacle of British industrial-era innovation. The ability to move products and people by steam locomotion had a transformative effect on society. British ingenuity saw railways knit communities together across the country, and eventually the globe. And for the next couple of centuries, little changed. The same techniques are being used to maintain track now that were used in Stephenson’s time."|1
"(CNN) — Portuguese sailors called it the ""Gates of Hell."" Namibia's Bushmen speak of the land God made in anger. From the air, the bleak shoreline of the Skeleton Coast looks wonderful -- a deep green sea, fringed with surf, breaks over a shore receding into infinite dunes. From land, it's a different story. The Benguela Current rushes in, urgent and strong, hurtling the chilling Atlantic into the fierce heat of the Namib. Whale and seal skeletons from the former whaling industry still litter the coastline -- the source of the region's frightening name."|1
