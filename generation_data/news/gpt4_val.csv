Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan acknowledged this difficult task while reiterating the importance of both projects.|0
Why do we only hear about Jasper Johns when he gets ripped off? Jasper Johns is the greatest artist alive. It seems a shame that he only enters the headlines when people rip him off.

In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don’t report to presidents. In Russia, things are different. Most of those businesses are majority-state-owned corporations, virtual branches of the government. And that means when you talk to the head of a Russian bank or oil company, you are effectively talking to the Kremlin. In 2000, when Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency, he consolidated competing power centers — media, business, local government, opposition parties and the Parliament — under his authority. He called it “a vertical of power.” This system now includes organized crime and cybercriminals.|1
PASSENGERS are now banned from drinking alcohol purchased from duty free shops under new rules . It 's hoped that the move will help to reduce incidents of unruly and disruptive behavior on flights. The rule was introduced by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and several airlines, such as British Airways and Ryanair, who urge passengers to inform cabin crew if they see someone consuming their own alcohol. Fines, prosecution, or being banned from future flights could be the consequences for those who ignore the new regulations. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in cases of alcohol-related antisocial behavior during air travel.|0

"German scientists working on the Wendelstein 7-X fusion device started a series of experiments that could eventually prove the superiority of stellarators over standard, less stable, tokamaks in fusion. The stellarator, Wendelstein 7-X, performed its first experiments with hydrogen fuel in February, reaching over 2,800°C. Recently, plasma suspended in the reactor for just 0.6 sec produced ""round, spinning 30-million degree gas the size of two football stadiums.” Increased confinement times increase plasma temperature and reduce power wastage, pushing fusion closer to a fully-developed sustainable solution, using heavy-hydrogen as nuclear fuel, eventually decommissioning dirty carbon or explosive fission power."|0

The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep. That is the provocative implication of recent research that examined investors’ financial risk-taking following periods when their sleep was disrupted. I concede that advice to get more sleep is hardly new, since we’ve been hearing that most of our lives — and the advice is honored more in the breach than in the observance. Furthermore, retirees typically would like to sleep more, but can’t — due to the disruptions in sleep patterns that are a normal part of the aging process.|1

I have written previously about my own pets, and the most common prompt for me to do this has been when my own animals have reached the end of their lives. For me, it has been a type of grief therapy sometimes, with the opportunity to write an obituary for an animal that's been an important part of my life. This week, the good news is that this is not an obituary. One of my two cats, Couscous, has been unwell, but so far, treatment has been successful, so this is a tale about her illness, not about her death.|1

There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams's performances that could, roughly, be called his American and British sides. On the American side, there was the slushy tendency towards sentimentality, for which he became increasingly known, which, at its best, resulted in Dead Poets Society, The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire, and, at its worst, became Patch Adams and Old Dogs. Hollywood has long had a tendency to adopt the finest and most interesting comedians and then determinedly blunt the hard edges that make them interesting. Along with Richard Pryor, Williams was the most obvious example of that.|1

Women who work in the White House do earn equal pay. Another right-made-up fact. The Republicans with their 12 percent approval rating, don’t you wonder who are the 12 percent that think the people driving the clown car are doing a good job?

French President Emmanuel Macron wants to invigorate the European Union as a global power and spurn the populist nationalism that threatens to undermine its success. But he knows it requires cooperation with the United States—which makes his strange bedfellow in the White House so crucial to his agenda. This piece originally appeared in the Washington Post. Macron, who at 40 is three decades younger than Trump, disdains the president’s abrasive nature and many of his policies, notably on Iran and climate change. The French president prefers books, ideas and lofty intellectual conversation to the aggressive transactional style embodied by Trump, who favors television over written text.|1

It has seemed for a while as though the global financial storm was going to deal a mostly glancing blow The global financial storm had appeared to only deliver a glancing blow to Italy's insurance industry, but now insurers have increasingly turned to low-grade, riskier bonds. By purchasing these low-grade assets, companies secure higher yields to help increase their income, but at a higher cost to their credit strength. It has also been found that Italian insurance firms have disproportionally higher exposure to higher-risk assets than any other Eurozone counterpart, as outlined in a UBS report.|0

Cryptocurrencies, outside of Bitcoin, have failed to garner much attention from buyers, and while the same can be said of sellers, the digestion of losses over the past month is likely to lead to more losses soon. Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin are all carving out a similar bear-flag pattern that should lead to another purge of speculative excesses. Weak price action in ETH/USD has it set up to make another leg lower soon. It could continue to drift ever-so-slightly higher, but the developing bear-flag implies risk is skewed more heavily towards the downside.|1

"The right sheet set and pajamas can help you stay cool.

If your memory foam mattress leaves you sweating at night, a few remedies can help turn down the heat -- if only by a few degrees. Anything you can do to distance your body from the memory foam will help keep you cool."|1

When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher, only the deepest, most corrosive cynicism is possible. Trampling on the rights of others for political advantage was the modus operandi of Adelaide's Nomenclature Committee in 1837.

The press coverage of Iraq’s surprise victory in the Asian Cup final was — as Ernst Bloch might have put it — full of utopian sentiment. The win was, admittedly, a remarkable achievement, but one that hardly accounted for the sheer exuberance of the outpoured emotion that followed.|1

The Republican, Rob McKenna, is one of a vanishing breed of Republicans who not only acknowledge that climate change is happening but support government action to fight it.|1
"The proposal that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to stem migration is nothing but 'hipster' colonialism. Last week, Germany's Africa Commissioner Gunter Nooke said that European countries should be allowed to lease land and to build and run cities in Africa as a means of stemming what he views as the unchecked expansion of migration from Africa to Europe. For Nooke, allowing the ""free development"" of these areas would stimulate African economies and create ""growth and prosperity"" and therefore, reduce the attractiveness of Europe as a destination for migration. The proposal has elicited mixed reactions."|1

New Jersey hits day three of its government shutdown Monday over a budget stalemate that's closed state parks — and will likely force the furlough of 35,000 workers. On Sunday, the impasse even inconvenienced Gov. Chris Christie, forcing him to leave a state beach that was on shutdown to the public — but open to his family — because he had to return to Trenton. All nonessential services remained closed as the Republican governor and the Democratic Assembly speaker continued to disagree over Christie's plan for a nonprofit health system that is at the center of the budget dispute.|1

I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad’s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should not constantly be called to account for the vicious behaviour of IS. Still less to be stigmatised until unnamed Muslim leaders disowned it. I was disconcerted to see so many Eureka Street readers appeared to agree with the demands against which she protested. Both Ruby’s complaint and the responses to it reminded me of the attitudes taken to Catholics in an earlier generation. The popular charges against Catholics were honed in the Great War and particularly by the referenda on Conscription.|1

What Steve Lonegan can teach Republicans about making life hell for Democrats . New Jersey Senate candidate Steve Lonegan may New Jersey Senate candidate Steve Lonegan offers key tactics Republicans can use to counter Democrats. Drawing on Lonegan's political history and messaging, Republicans should leverage local stories to oppose major Democrat policies, channel and personify public frustration against Democrats, force Democrats to defend vulnerable positions on certain policies, and focus on critical policy points over minor matters. By adopting such strategies, the Republican Party could better resist Democratic proposals, consolidate their messaging, and communicate a strong platform to voters.|0
The movement is a global phenomenon – but here it has stalled before even getting started. RIDESHARING SERVICES WHICH supporters claim could spare Irish cities from gridlock are being effectively locked out of the country on the grounds of breaking taxi laws. Transport officials have recently questioned one of the industry’s newest entrants, a carpooling app backed by entrepreneur and Dragon’s Den investor Sean O’Sullivan, on how it fits within rules that have already seen similar operators abandon the market. But Cork-based startup Carma Carpooling claims it is only promoting the kind of ridesharing setups neighbours and colleagues have been doing for decades.|1

In a democracy , it is said , we get the government we deserve . The same can be said for the current state of social media, which is grappling with issues like fake news and hate speech. As a reflection of society, social media platforms often mirror the issues affecting us.

Consequently, citizens, social media platforms, and the government must all actively collaborate to maintain democracy by fostering meaningful and authentic communication and engagement in the digital world.|0

To most NBA experts, players and fans, Kobe Bryant is one of the top 20 best players of all time and one of the top five guards the league has ever produced. To some, he is second only to Michael Jordan and to a third, out there, group he is the best of all time. To get the first group of people to consider agreeing with the second (I leave out the third because nobody seriously believes that is ever possible), Kobe Bryant has to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a championship this season.|1
The first image of Earth from lunar orbit . Before an Apollo-era NASA could launch a few humans on top of a rocket and send them hurtling to the moon, scientists needed proof that they could actually identify a suitable landing site. So in 1964, the U.S. space agency sent the Lunar Orbiter 1 to photograph the lunar surface up-close, inadvertently capturing an awe-inspiring sight: the first-ever image of Earth from lunar orbit. The incredible snapshot not only provided NASA with critical data for the impending moon mission but also gave the world a profound new perspective on our delicate planet as seen from the void of space.|0

The Economic Research Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka says that according to provisional data , the overall balance of payments has posted a surplus of $947 million during January to April 2021. This is mainly attributed to increased earnings from merchandise exports, decline in imports, and continued inflows of worker remittances. Merchandise export earnings for April recorded a significant growth of 183%, while cumulative earnings for January-April 2021 reached $3.45 billion. Furthermore, Sri Lanka recorded its highest-ever monthly worker remittances of $736 million in April, which may further bolster the country's economic recovery amid the ongoing global crisis.|0

With the lessons of 2014 fresh in their collective memory and the 2016 election cycle about to start, progressive groups and Democrats have been making a sustained push to highlight policies to boost incomes for the poor and middle class and fight income inequality.

The Center for American Progress released a series of policy recommendations for “ensuring that middle- and lower-income households are the substantial beneficiaries” of economic growth.|1

Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “Thank You” rally was the crowd’s silence when Trump mentioned that everyone should come together. The irony being that his campaign has been anything but unifying, which is why his supporters backed him. They’re tired of seeing this country’s demographics being changed, their white privilege being challenged. Unity and inclusion is far from what these people want — even after the election’s over. I left Cincinnati tired and disheveled, but perhaps mostly worried about our future.|1
Peter Brimelow writes : On November 21 , 2008 , I spoke in Baltimore at the inaugural meeting of the H.L. Mencken Club, a gathering for thinkers seeking open debate about critical social and political topics.

As many writers were deeply opposed to government regulations and social censorship, topics of discussion included freedom of speech, civil rights, and American society's issues. It became a highly provocative gathering, putting forth bold thoughts about race and intelligence that in today's society continue to provoke deep political divides.|0
What Steve Lonegan can teach Republicans about making life hell for Democrats.

Steve Lonegan, Booker’s opponent, is running his third statewide campaign, his first as a nominee.|1
Many Alberta small-business owners, who have been struggling through a prolonged economic downturn, are hoping the next provincial government will bring relief through business-friendly policies. The Alberta election is April 16 and polls suggest that Rachel Notley’s ruling New Democrats will be replaced with Jason Kenney’s United Conservatives, which have campaigned to scrap the carbon tax and loosen some labour rules that have driven up business costs. Over the past two years, small-business confidence in Alberta has reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the country, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which has been tracking the measure for about 20 years.|1

I thought I was an acceptable kind of evangelical. I'm not a fundamentalist. My friends and I enjoy art, alcohol, and cultural engagement. We avoid spiritual clichés and buzzwords.

We could disagree about truth, spirituality, and morality, and remain on the best of terms. The failures of the church often made me more uncomfortable than those in the broader culture.|1

The cemetery, designated a historic site by the Washington County Historical Society, has ties to the founders of Mars Inc., the giant candy manufacturing company.|1

Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the Washington County, Oregon has many stories of historical value held in its two primary cemeteries. The long-accepted view was that these cemeteries only dated back to 1850. However, recently the history detectives group from the Old Town Center Cemetery Association uncovered tombstones predating to the late 1700s. Consequently, cemetery experts have renewed their attempts to recognize, research and reconstruct historical memorials at local cemeteries. This effort should deepen connections to the historical narrative, grant clearer perspectives about local history and cherish those who pioneered this now fast-growing region.|0

Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child’s play, thanks to MIT. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a parser that imitates kids’ learning processes by observing the environment and making connections. The system studies captioned videos and learns to associate words with objects and actions. When given a new sentence, the parser can accurately predict its meaning—without visual clues. This “weakly supervised” approach, which requires limited training input, could expand the types of data and reduce the effort needed for training parsers. Annotations can certainly speed up the process, but they’re not needed to learn.|1

Beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl is never easy. When they scored 21 points the first three times they held the ball in the second half and took a 33-32 lead, we all thought the same scary movie we’ve seen since 2001 was replaying before our eyes.

Proposed reforms include more transparent campaign contributions, closing loopholes for lobbyists, enhancing conflict-of-interest rules and stopping state-led voter registration roll purges. Although the proposal received heavy Democratic support, some critics argue the broad and transformative reforms are merely a messaging strategy ahead of the 2020 elections."|0

"(CNN) — Portuguese sailors called it the ""Gates of Hell."" Namibia's Bushmen speak of the land God made in anger. From the air, the bleak shoreline of the Skeleton Coast looks wonderful -- a deep green sea, fringed with surf, breaks over a shore receding into infinite dunes. From land, it's a different story. The Benguela Current rushes in, urgent and strong, hurtling the chilling Atlantic into the fierce heat of the Namib. Whale and seal skeletons from the former whaling industry still litter the coastline -- the source of the region's frightening name."|1

So can you tell the difference between those dB levels? In my tests, I could indeed hear Chipolo Plus a little bit better than the other trackers, though the difference is subtle.|1

We need to deal with the business we have before us,” Bill Clinton told CNN in December.

Two years ago, Red Sox prospect Ryan Westmoreland seemed to be on the fast track to the majors. The Portsmouth native, who the Sox selected in the fifth round of the 2008 draft, got off to a blazing start in his professional career in 2009 in Single-A Lowell.

""The success of the ECA sticks in the throat of Unions, because it has delivered what they couldn't: more jobs and higher wages.  industrial disputes have fallen to their lowest level since 1935."|1
Under Trump, presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor. Since discovering that the constitution gives him the somewhat controversial power to absolve criminals who are also his friends, Donald Trump has pardoned more people and commuted more sentences in his first 18 months in office than any of his three immediate predecessors. The pardoning spree continued on Tuesday, as Trump issued two more before jetting off to Europe to stomp all over NATO, this time clearing the names of father-son arsonist duo Dwight and Steven Hammond, Oregon cattle ranchers whose 2016 fight against the federal government became a conservative cause célèbre.|1

American troops may have finally left Iraq , but for that nation 's citizens the war is only getting worse Iraq continues to face worsening conflicts and crises since the departure of American troops, with an escalation in violence and numerous internal issues persisting.

My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors. For example, consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron, or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one. Each of these cells, (if taken from the same individual) has an identical genome — and yet each is “reading” a very distinct subset of that genome and consequently carrying out very different behaviors. The choice of what to read and what to hide away is made during development.|1

The five-storied 'Farhad Mansion' resembles any other well-maintained house in an affluent neighbourhood of Chittagong city. Yet no gatekeeper guards any of the two steel gates that lead to the small front yard and the stairway of the building. With the summer holidays, it is not surprising that the ground and fourth floors that house an English medium school are deserted. But even the residential second and third floors show no signs of life. Climbing to the top, the locked grilled-gate to the roof is reached. Standing there, one cannot help but shudder, imagining what had happened there on April 27, 2012.|1

On the other hand, many states charge less than $100 to file a trademark application. Keep in mind that state registration will not offer multi-state protection, nationwide priority status, incontestability, a presumption of validity or the ability to file a trademark on an intent to use basis.|1

Aid agencies are tentatively also giving away cash and letting refugees decide for themselves what they need. While the results may be unexpected, the money is being wisely spent and rarely wasted - contrary to old prejudices among donors.|1
