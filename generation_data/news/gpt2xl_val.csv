"BUHLER - The south wall of Jim Baker Fieldhouse is considered hallowed ground at Buhler High. It's reserved for the visiting team and it's where they play their homecoming games. If you think about it, that's a lot to ask of a student-athlete. The National Association of Broadcasters, the nation's trade association for radio broadcasters, is asking Congress to block President Trump's FCC nominee Ajit Pai from serving on the five-member panel that oversees its members' operations. ""Today we're filing a legal brief in support of an emergency motion filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C."|0
BOB Cole died yesterday. Around 2pm in a purpose-built flat on a Swiss industrial estate outside Zurich, he was found dead. A doctor who attended the scene said Mr Cole, 59, had sustained an 'unexplained cardiac arrest' and would be laid to rest in his hometown of Colchester, Essex. His family has requested that the cause of death is not officially confirmed until next of kin have been informed. I'm not sure there's a better way to spend an afternoon than hanging out with my favorite bloggers and getting to know what they're passionate about.|0
Running errands on your bicycle is a great way to burn calories and get some exercise. When you need something small or you are just checking prices and availability, pedaling to the store can be a pleasant experience if you can find a bicycle-friendly route. Several major shopping locations in the Rogue Valley can be accessed by bicycles without encountering excessive traffic. For example, both the Rogue Valley Mall and the Medford Shopping Center are easily accessible from the Bear Creek Greenway bicycle path. It is somewhat more difficult to ride a bike to the big-box stores along Highway 62 (Crater Lake Highway).|1
MANSEHRA, Nov 27 : Provincial Minister for Haj and Auqaf Nimroz Khan on Tuesday said time was not far away to establish the province as an international educational and tourism destination. He was speaking at an event to inaugurate the International Tourism Exhibition (ITE), here. If it's a cold, you'll need something to keep your head dry.

Police in Itami, Hyogo Prefecture, said Monday they have arrested an unemployed 45-year-old woman on suspicion of fraudulently using credit cards for personal use. They say they found suspicious transactions on the card after she went public with the incident last week. The woman allegedly used a debit card issued to her by a bank in Tokyo's Ueno ward to pay for rental expenses at a hotel where she worked. When confronted by the police, the suspect admitted having spent ¥5 million ($47,500) on a car that was purchased through the card over several months.|0

When Pacers coach Frank Vogel announced he would sit all five starters for last night's game against the Bucks, it was like a thought experiment come to life. Can a good team's second unit beat the starters of a historically awful team? It was close, but...yes! The game was an exciting one, if only from a theoretical standpoint: You desperately wanted to see what would happen, but not necessarily actually watch it go down. Because this wasn't Copeland and Solomon Hill and C.J. Watson getting meaningful minutes in just any late-season game—this game mattered.|1
WASHINGTON – Congress is moving to put under military control all armed contractors operating in combat zones, a Pentagon official said Friday. The move would require that the Defense Department turn over the contract holders to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). It would also allow the DoD to close down or reorganize any contractor if circumstances change. The move comes days after House Republicans unveiled their new defense policy framework, one day after U.S. troops killed 16 Pakistani soldiers in a terrorist attack in the border town of Tora Bora and before President Obama departs for Europe.|0
"Before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married, the tabloids floated a strange rumour: the couple might elope. Would they run off to Jamaica? Hawaii? Toronto? Would they decamp to the Okavango Delta in Botswana, where the howls of exotic animals would greet a small gathering of family and friends as the young couple held hands before a vegan minister, swapping vows in the crackling glow of a union pyre as flames licked the sky and village elders blessed guests before the yoga-safari reception? It was not entirely clear. Opinion | Vinay Menon: Forget Frogmore Castle: Come back to Toronto Harry and Meghan!"|1

"Bavarian farmers are angry that their famous Alpine dairy cows will apparently have to wear nappies under European Union environmental laws. Johann Huber, whose family has farmed on the mountain slopes of Gmund am Tegernsee for over 400 years, has begun putting home made nappies on his 18 diary cows to avoid falling foul of an EU fertiliser ban.

""We have no standard nappies, they have not been developed commercially yet,"" he said."|1
"Made of Q-Tips, this craft goes far beyond a miniature garland or cake topper. The light strand also can be attached to any type of flower. It's about time. There is no way that the NFL, one of the greatest sports organizations ever, will allow its players to wear shirts with racist slogans like ""White Power"" or ""Kikes Rule"" in their name. But it appears that some teams have already done so. On Tuesday, ESPN's Stephen A Smith reported that the New England Patriots and Miami Dolphins wore shirts during pre-season games featuring those messages."|0
Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the hard work required to maintain it. Amid the hubbub of shopping centers and the din of traffic from nearby Hwy. 61, the cemetery sandwiched between McDonald's and Tires Plus seems jarringly out of place. Few pause to notice the prim patch of well-tended green, bounded by an iron fence, that holds some of Cottage Grove's earliest pioneers. The cemetery, designated a historic site by the Washington County Historical Society, has ties to the founders of Mars Inc., the giant candy manufacturing company.|1

Some days he’s in prison, or squatting in a storage bin. Other mornings he wakes up in a goat pen or a tropical hammock.|1
Running errands on your bicycle is a great way to burn calories and get some exercise.

Producer Martin Swope added the tape effects that lend the band its dreamlike, blurred-around-the-edges sound."|1

This can be concluded from the commission's response to an EUobserver access to documents request, which asked for recent correspondence between the commission and EU capitals about the transport of animals to Turkey. ""The documents requested are letters exchanged with member states in the context of an ongoing administrative investigation on the implementation of regulation (EC) No 1/2005,"" said the commission's directorate-general for health and food safety in a letter to EUobserver."|1

The team that brought you driverless cars and Siri is now fighting a new kind of war on information. In the world of internet memes, Instagram filters, and Photoshop, seeing is no longer believing. Everyone is a photographer or videographer once they have a smartphone in their hands, which often comes equipped with alteration tools already installed. But manipulations that started with cropping and teeth-whitening have spurred into the spread of misinformation.

In recent years, platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their artistry. For the generation of designers who grew up playing “Super Mario Bros.” platformers offer a sound formula. Though the goal of such games is usually to get from one area to the next, that framework supports copious possibilities. Determining how a character moves through a world and what sorts of things should impede or assist in the process allows plenty of room for creativity. It is why games like “Journey” and “Inside” can both be constructed around jumping avatars but otherwise appear quite distinct.|1
SAVANNAH, Ga. ( AP ) — A pair of Buckeyes were doing their best to hold off a team of Georgia Tech's caliber in the second half Sunday, but an upset victory seemed like a possibility late in the game. Ohio State coach Urban Meyer said before the game that it was his goal to make the Dawgs' star quarterback, Justin Thomas, throw the ball downfield more often. When he did not, Meyer had another plan. MADISON, Wis. -- The Wisconsin Legislature passed a bill Monday allowing people with concealed carry permits to openly carry guns on college campuses.|0
Hybrid Cloud: Wave of the Future or Digital Chimera? Home Blogs Infrastructure Hybrid Cloud: Wave Of The Future Or Digital Chimera? The hybrid cloud remains the top infrastructure initiative in the enterprise, but it is a huge undertaking and leads into such deep, uncharted waters that it is by no means a smooth transition. Quite naturally, as the difficulties mount, more voices are starting to call the wisdom of the hybrid cloud into question. Does it really provide the benefits that supporters claim? Is it really the best way to prepare for the emerging digital economy?|1
The Brexit crowd refused to believe the experts in the run-up to the referendum vote. The warnings from every leading economic body, including the Bank of England, were dismissed as scaremongering that should be ignored. Now, apparently, the words of the Governor of the Bank of England and other economists are so influential they can talk us into a recession – I am baffled by this double-think. But we need not agonise over all the talk now, because the facts are mounting up. Last week, we reported exclusive figures showing a sharp fall in the number of shoppers out on our high streets.|1

Many Alberta small-business owners, who have been struggling through a prolonged economic downturn, are hoping the next provincial government will bring relief through business-friendly policies. The Alberta election is April 16 and polls suggest that Rachel Notley’s ruling New Democrats will be replaced with Jason Kenney’s United Conservatives, which have campaigned to scrap the carbon tax and loosen some labour rules that have driven up business costs. Over the past two years, small-business confidence in Alberta has reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the country, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which has been tracking the measure for about 20 years.|1

When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher, only the deepest, most corrosive cynicism is possible. Trampling on people's dignity has become routine in America, and it will continue unless something is done about it. NEW YORK -- For the first time since 1996, the Boston Bruins are sitting at the bottom of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. That's not a bad place to be for one year, considering how poorly they were playing this season.

So, what’s next after all of the early NBA free agency buzz? Nothing like what’s happened so far, one would think. Unless Kawhi Leonard gets dealt, we’re waiting on a bunch of restricted free agents and whether or not they will stay put or sign offer sheets elsewhere. That list includes Houston’s Clint Capela, one of the premier centres in the league who surely will stick in Texas, Chicago’s Zach LaVine, who was one of the key pieces in last years Jimmy Butler trade, Boston guard Marcus Smart, Portland centre Jusuf Nurkic and former No.|1

America is voting Tuesday to fill the country's top job opening. The country also has over five million other jobs waiting for the right candidate. The Labor Department said Tuesday that America had 5.5 million job openings in September, close to the record high of 5.8 million openings set in April. There was even a small increase in federal government job openings. It's a great sign that employers want to hire. However, this huge number of openings also signals that employers can't find the workers with the right skills for the open jobs that they have.|1

This week, the good news is that this is not an obituary. One of my two cats, Couscous, has been unwell, but so far, treatment has been successful, so this is a tale about her illness, not about her death.|1

She directs the Northside Step Dance Team in Shoreline, and last year, her team used their dance routine to protest the police shootings of unarmed black people. Step dancing has a rich cultural history. It became popular in the United States in the early 1900s at historically black colleges and universities. But it started even farther back. “It started historically back in Africa with certain tribes using it, and then through slavery as a way of communication, so there’s a lot of call and response,” Darnesha said.|1

A new study for The New York Times reveals that the media pay for the top 200 CEOs is now $14.5 million. This is up 55 in the last year. While any one CEO may be well worth his/her raise, it is a growing political and PR problem for corporate America to be seen as rewarding those at the top, with little consideration for actual performance. For millions of Americans who are unemployed, under employed and being foreclosed on, it seems inconceivable that corporate CEOs can be getting significant raises at a time of such economic hardship.|1

The five-storied 'Farhad Mansion' resembles any other well-maintained house in an affluent neighbourhood of Chittagong city. Yet no gatekeeper guards any of the two steel gates that lead to the small front yard and the stairway of the building.

But even the residential second and third floors show no signs of life. Climbing to the top, the locked grilled-gate to the roof is reached. Standing there, one cannot help but shudder, imagining what had happened there on April 27, 2012.|1
Under Trump, presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor. Since discovering this behavior, President Obama has issued 20 such pardons in the first five months of his presidency. That's an average of just one per month.

New research released today from the Geena Davis Institute on Gender and Media shows that we have a long way to go in our depictions of girls and women onscreen in family-friendly movies.

"The storm we're bracing for is the type of January variety everyone prepares for: monitor school closings, check flashlights and stock up on bread, eggs and milk. It's hard to know exactly how any storm will hit until it actually arrives. But there's a foreboding sense about what to expect in the coming days. ""We had something comparable in January 2014,"" said Aaron Reynolds, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Buffalo.

He is right, of course, that pretending all sides of any controversy are equally valid is nonsense. But a good deal of the issue hinges on our definition of ""teaching"" a position. If ""teaching"" means that the teacher merely presents all sides of a controversy as though they were equal in weight and legitimacy, then we are being equal time indoctrinists."|1
An injury at work left a husband and father facing a layoff. He couldn't return to the job until his hand healed from surgery, but recovery was complicated by an ongoing struggle with diabetes.

Considering all the comings and goings of people involved in the project, we should be grateful that Bohemian Rhapsody has finally landed on the big screen.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Democrat John Edwards endorsed former rival Barack Obama on Wednesday, a move designed to help solidify support for the party’s likely presidential nominee even as Hillary Rodham Clinton refuses to give up her long-shot candidacy. The endorsement came a day after Clinton defeated Obama by more than 2-to-1 in the West Virginia primary. The loss highlighted Obama’s challenge in winning over the “Hillary Democrats” — white, working-class voters who also supported Edwards in significant numbers before he exited the race in late January. He said Obama “stands with me” in a fight to cut poverty in half within 10 years.|1

Could Washington state elect the greenest governor in the nation? All around the country this election season, we are hearing from voters asking about a wide variety of political issues. One of the questions is whether or not people want to see candidates with experience running for public office, who have never held elected office before, make the final decision as to who controls the levers of power in their communities. Is there any truth to that? As a longtime member of Congress and now a former gubernatorial candidate in Washington State, I would say yes.|0

My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors. For example, consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron, or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one. Each of these cells, (if taken from the same individual) has an identical genome — and yet each is “reading” a very distinct subset of that genome and consequently carrying out very different behaviors. The choice of what to read and what to hide away is made during development.|1

Today marks the 314th anniversary of the last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. Geological records indicate that this 9.0 magnitude quake occurred in what is now northern Washington on March 12, 1700, just one year after the Great Shasta Earthquake of 1776. The earthquake was followed by an epic flood, which is widely considered to be one of the five worst floods in North American history. There were at least 20 deaths associated with the flood, and as many as 10 million people lost their homes. This event caused more than 6 million people worldwide to suffer economic loss from damaged infrastructure and crops destroyed by flooding.|0
If you can't find figs, layer the cream and the crunch here onto whichever fruits are in season. We happen to have a line on super-fresh figs – from the elementary school down the street from us. If you don't know any third-graders tending to some fig trees, however, layer the cream and the crunch here onto whichever fruits are in season; apples and pears now, berries later. You might even play with the mascarpone and toasted pine nuts in savory applications: Dollop cheese onto steak off the grill and finish with nuts.|1
ARSENE WENGER last night confessed he passed up the chance to buy Didier Drogba – for just £100,000! The Arsenal star's new contract with the Gunners will reportedly cost him a staggering £5million a season. And he is planning on playing his football at the Emirates until he is 40! The former Liverpool striker admits he could have used a loan spell during his time in England. 'I thought I would have enjoyed more time in England before I moved there,' said Suarez. 'But it was a difficult decision because I always loved Liverpool. 'My first experience of England was really good.|0
In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don’t report to presidents. In Russia, things are different. Most of those businesses are majority-state-owned corporations, virtual branches of the government. And that means when you talk to the head of a Russian bank or oil company, you are effectively talking to the Kremlin. In 2000, when Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency, he consolidated competing power centers — media, business, local government, opposition parties and the Parliament — under his authority. He called it “a vertical of power.” This system now includes organized crime and cybercriminals.|1

"Ex-Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci had extensive plans for President Trump's communications department before he was booted from the White House on Monday, according to multiple news reports. The New York Times and Politico both reported that it was Scaramucci's idea to set up a new press shop within the White House so that Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders could take on more communication duties. A source close to Scaramucci told Politico that the ex-communications director wanted to get ""a few of the people who have been around the president for a while,"" into a position to handle media relations."|0
"In a small way, we made history. Last Saturday, an ad hoc group of citizens interested in improving an aspect of public policy sat down informally with the civil servants responsible and designed a web service to do the job. In all, it took less than five hours.

MANCHESTER UNITED outcast Morgan Schneiderlin has emerged as a January target for Inter Milan, according to reports. Schneiderlin is wanted by Jose Mourinho and could be reunited with the Chelsea boss at Stamford Bridge this month. The former France international joined United in 2013 after a year at Manchester City. He has scored just one goal in 22 appearances this season and has been left on the bench whenever Mourinho decides to rest or rotate his starting XI. United have failed to win any of their nine Premier League matches since he was given his debut.|0

The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep. That is the provocative implication of recent research that examined investors’ financial risk-taking following periods when their sleep was disrupted. I concede that advice to get more sleep is hardly new, since we’ve been hearing that most of our lives — and the advice is honored more in the breach than in the observance. Furthermore, retirees typically would like to sleep more, but can’t — due to the disruptions in sleep patterns that are a normal part of the aging process.|1

"The thorny question of abortion rights is again taking center stage on Beacon Hill and putting some top officials in an uncomfortable spot, chief among them Gov. Charlie Baker. This week Baker, a Republican who supports abortion rights, celebrated the signing of a bill approving $8 million to offset the potential loss of federal funding to women's reproductive health organizations under a new Trump administration rule. That rule, dubbed a ""gag rule"" by critics, would prohibit federally funded family planning clinics from making abortion referrals or sharing office space with abortion providers."|1
Promises to replace houses sold off under the Right to Buy scheme look increasingly hollow as the Government slashes council houses' sale price to a third of the cost of replacements. The Government is now selling off council homes at an average price of £59,000, down from over £80,000 before they came to power, a BuzzFeed analysis has shown. The government is selling off the country's remaining council homes at lower prices than ever before despite a soaring housing market. Social tenants have had the 'Right to Buy' their homes at a large discount since Margaret Thatcher introduced the policy in 1980.|1
In December 2013, INSYS received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) demanding records pertaining to its marketing activities.

Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of flaws in the way universal credit is designed, campaigners say. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG ) said arbitrary rules built in to the way universal credit is calculated leave some families unable to predict how much they will be paid each month, leaving households in debt and unable to budget. It can lead to claimants being wrongly benefit-capped – a penalty designed to “incentivise” jobless or low-earning households by severely limiting their benefits – because the system fails to spot they are working and earning enough.|1

Although state trademark registration offers fewer benefits than trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, state trademark registration can be a cheap alternative for securing limited trademark rights. Federal trademark registration can run anywhere from several hundred dollars to $3,000, depending on the type of mark being registered and the amount of attorney's fees. On the other hand, many states charge less than $100 to file a trademark application. Keep in mind that state registration will not offer multi-state protection, nationwide priority status, incontestability, a presumption of validity or the ability to file a trademark on an intent to use basis.|1

Consol Energy was a winner within the metals & mining industry, rising 99 cents ( 3.1 % ) to close at $40.08. Stiff oil prices have also contributed to this gain, with the company's benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude falling to just over $30 per barrel earlier in August. While the price has now risen back above $35 per barrel, it remains well below its peak of nearly $107 per barrel reached in early 2014.

The court's ruling is likely to affect more than 6,000 employees of private corporations who claim that such deductions are required by law. It is also likely to have major ramifications for the millions of freelance workers whose income derives entirely from their ability to design, build, maintain and troubleshoot software systems."|0

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India ( Irdai ) has proposed to ask some insurance companies to mandatorily inform the consumers before any claim is made, a senior official told Mail Today on Sunday.

But this lovely-looking Ungulate hasn’t been completely wiped out because they can still be found at zoos around the world.

A riot of tropicalia, The Garden of Good and Evil is all parrots, crucifixes, Dia de los Muertos skulls and anacondas wrapped around naked women's legs.

This is not only a joyless recovery, for the vast majority of people it's a moneyless one.

In Atlanta This Weekend? Then You Should Be At Momocon. Anime and gaming convention Momocon is on day three of it’s newly extended four-day run, which leaves plenty of time to check out some cosplay, buy some vintage video games and maybe watch a Kotaku writer judge an indie game contest. When I first attended Momocon back in 2010, it was an incredibly small convention held on the campus of Georgia Tech. Now it’s a massive event spanning multiple locations—the Omni Hotel, the Georgia World Congress Center, the Georgia World Congress Center’s tiny bathrooms—with more than 20,00o people expected to attend.|1
The right sheet set and pajamas can help you stay cool. Today ’ s memory-foam mattresses don't sleep like they used to. But there is still a market for them. If you are the kind of person that likes to have a few drinks in the evening or to relax at night with a good book or an audiobook, look no further than memory foam mattresses. While memory foam has become a popular choice for both people with back pain and those who need to get more rest, there are many other reasons why you should consider using it as a bedding material.|0

"AUSTIN — Rep. Rafael Anchia filed a resolution Monday condemning President Donald Trump's executive order restricting travel to the United States for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. Anchia, a Democrat from Dallas, described the move as ""unconstitutional, un-American, unwise and unorganized."" ""This was not well thought out,"" Anchia said. ""It was developed without consultation of the folks that are supposed to keep us safe, and the president really messed this up, and he needs to pull it down. The Legislature of the state of Texas needs to demand that he do so."""|1
"The University of Arkansas at Fort Smith recently told student Jennifer Braly that she was prohibited from giving lectures about feminism in her English 101 class because ""feminism is not an acceptable subject matter for students who identify themselves as liberal or progressive."" The university didn't specify which professors are feminist, but did point to a number of high-profile female academics who have been unable to make their classroom presentations about women's issues. And it certainly didn't help the case that Braly used the first person plural form of feminism to refer to herself."|0
I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad’s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should not constantly be called to account for the vicious behaviour of IS. Still less to be stigmatised until unnamed Muslim leaders disowned it. I was disconcerted to see so many Eureka Street readers appeared to agree with the demands against which she protested. Both Ruby’s complaint and the responses to it reminded me of the attitudes taken to Catholics in an earlier generation. The popular charges against Catholics were honed in the Great War and particularly by the referenda on Conscription.|1
Hundreds have digital say on how they manage their health and wellbeing. Last year Healthier Lancashire and South Cumbria asked the Healthwatch Collaborative to help them find out what local people think about using digital technology to manage their health and wellbeing.

The aim of the project was to explore how local people currently use technology to manage their health and wellbeing – and that of their families and those they support or care for.|1
"Student Senators passed a resolution that would have NYU divest from three companies associated with the Israeli government and institute a boycott of those companies in recognition of Israel's denial of Palestinian refugees' rights. The resolution, drafted by the New York University Graduate Student Assembly, is designed to push back against an anti-Israel resolution passed by the Students United for Justice in Palestine, a campus group affiliated with the university. The resolution states that NYU should ""undertake all measures necessary"" to ensure that its investments do not support the Israeli military or settlements in Palestinian territories."|0

There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams's performances that could, roughly, be called his American and British sides. On the American side, there was the slushy tendency towards sentimentality, for which he became increasingly known, which, at its best, resulted in Dead Poets Society, The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire, and, at its worst, became Patch Adams and Old Dogs. Hollywood has long had a tendency to adopt the finest and most interesting comedians and then determinedly blunt the hard edges that make them interesting. Along with Richard Pryor, Williams was the most obvious example of that.|1
The Brexit crowd refused to believe the experts in the run-up to the referendum vote.

"JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar : for many years, it was a ritual that ended with Palestinians being forced out. This past Friday, however, thousands of Palestinian activists and supporters were not only allowed to visit the holy site, they also got a rare glimpse inside the inner sanctum of the Jewish holy site. On the way out, I asked a female Israeli soldier whether she felt any special affinity towards her Palestinian colleagues. Her reply was surprising. ""I have some kind of emotional connection with them,"" she said."|0
Under Trump, presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor. Since discovering that the constitution gives him the somewhat controversial power to absolve criminals who are also his friends, Donald Trump has pardoned more people and commuted more sentences in his first 18 months in office than any of his three immediate predecessors. The pardoning spree continued on Tuesday, as Trump issued two more before jetting off to Europe to stomp all over NATO, this time clearing the names of father-son arsonist duo Dwight and Steven Hammond, Oregon cattle ranchers whose 2016 fight against the federal government became a conservative cause célèbre.|1

Other events add to the excitement. They, too, are a lot of work. But they add something to our lives for which we should be thankful.

Two years ago, Red Sox prospect Ryan Westmoreland seemed to be on the fast track to the majors. The Portsmouth native, who the Sox selected in the fifth round of the 2008 draft, got off to a blazing start in his professional career in 2009 in Single-A Lowell. In 60 games with the Spinners, the outfielder hit .296 with seven homers and 19 stolen bases, and his five-tool potential helped him quickly ascend up everyone's list of top Red Sox prospects. But all of that changed in a hurry when, in March of 2010, he was diagnosed with a cavernous malformation in his brain.|1

Barack Obama ’ s presidency has coincided with immense growth of social media services like Facebook and Twitter. And while those platforms have allowed people to speak directly to one another from around the globe, their real-world impact has been far more complicated.

There was a time, not so long ago, when there were only two major brands selling Android smartphones: Samsung and LG.|0

We all know about vampires, werewolves, demons, and wizards—but do you know that there are others who call themselves ""paranormal investigators?"" The term ""skeptical"" can be hard to pin down because it really doesn't describe any specific type of skeptical person. What exactly does it mean to be skeptical? It means questioning something without believing in it 100 percent."|0
"China began three days of national mourning for the victims of the May 12 earthquake, restricting access to entertainment, shopping and other public places as a security precaution. In a statement carried by state-run news service Xinhua, the authorities said they would take whatever measures were needed to ensure safety. This is an excellent question. I've thought about it a little but not in very detail. One of the best ways I can think to do it would be like this:

Patient is a 36-year-old male who immigrated from southwest Asia three months ago, and now has a pustular pruritic eruption that lasts for two weeks. The patient reported severe burning sensations and itching at the site of the eruptions (fig 1 ). For more than a century, scientists have argued over whether there's any real evidence to prove that our planet is actually on the verge of another ice age. But now, according to new research published in the journal Nature, they may have found something that disproves those claims.|0
Doing business in British Columbia is particularly challenging because of the province’s reputation as a hotbed of environmental and aboriginal activism. John Winter worries it could get worse, threatening $90-billion in planned projects, if the Northern Gateway oil pipeline isn’t built. “If this thing fails it will be a serious and significant issue,” Mr. Winter, president and CEO of the B.C. Chamber of Commerce, which represents 125 chambers around the province with 36,000 businesses in every sector of the economy, said in an interview.|1
If you live along the Eastern Seaboard and wake up early Friday you could be treated to a colorful sky show as Earth's northern lights illuminate the evening sky. The Aurora Borealis is expected to peak around 3 p.m. ET in the area of Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. It will move westward through the Atlantic Ocean toward the New England coast by mid-afternoon. Two men were fatally shot Thursday afternoon (Aug. 16) in East Baltimore. Baltimore police spokesman T.J. Smith said three people were arrested on drug charges after the shootings. In each case, police say they believe the shooting stemmed from a robbery attempt.|0

A violent thug has been jailed after he unleashed his American pitbull dog on a man who died six days later. Greece's debt crisis came to a head in the country's banks this week, as depositors and savers withdrew funds in huge amounts. The move caused the country's main stock exchange to crash.

"The footage comes days after former St. Anthony, Minnesota, police officer Jeronimo Yanez was acquitted for killing Castile during a traffic stop. The two officers involved were also acquitted last week in the shooting death of another African American man, Philando Castile. The jury said both officers acted reasonably when they shot Castile to protect themselves or others from what they believed was imminent danger. Prosecutors had alleged that the five-time Pro Bowler and former college football player had made a ""furtive move"" while reaching for his driver's license. They claimed he had a gun in his pocket."|0

Plushenko’s glorious career was finished. He had hoped to cap it at home after a comeback from spinal surgery, which he did, partially, by helping Russia win the team competition. But his 31-year-old back, after all those years of wrenching revolutions and hard landings, gave out two nights too soon. In essence, Plushenko sacrificed his chance at another individual medal to put his country on top. He was a longshot for gold, but in a sport of sequins and stuffed animals, he brought pugnacious sizzle. He was the James Cagney of the ice.|1
Is a roving, body-scanning van a needed surveillance tool or a another step toward eroding personal privacy? Andy Greenberg of Forbes is reporting that American Science & Engineering, which provides x-ray scanners to governments and defense companies, has introduced a van capable of scanning nearby cars. The Z Backscatter Vans, or ZBVs, are used to scan for explosives, drugs and people, making them an ideal tool for security, law enforcement and border control agencies. The vans work by emitting low-level x-rays off and through nearby objects to collect a visual snapshot of other vehicles.|1
The feud between California and the Trump administration grows as the president visits the California-Mexico border to inspect wall prototypes. James Schwab said he resigned because he could not maintain mischaracterizations made by Sessions that some 800 undocumented immigrants evaded ICE arrest in February after Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf issued a public warning about imminent ICE operation in the Bay Area. Last week, while visiting Sacramento to announce a Department of Justice (DOJ) lawsuit against California’s policies that protect immigrants from deportation, Session addressed the Oakland immigration raids. “Those are 800 wanted criminals that are now at large in that community,” Sessions said.|1

"In Syria, Peace Plan 'Is Unraveling': The Two-Way `` It's almost as if in certain parts of the globe, war is a daily occurrence. In this country, it has been a long-running problem. President Barack Obama vowed to bring America and Russia together to ""degrade and ultimately eradicate"" the Islamic State group. After four years of airstrikes by the United States and other allies in Iraq and Syria, there is little progress toward that end. And now, some are raising questions about whether the strategy may not have been the best idea."|0
Although there’s long been a debate over the accuracy of health information online, many U.S. Internet users aren’t hesitant to use the Web when they want answers to health-related questions. And rather than dedicated health sites, the vast majority of them begin their research at a search engine. A new study out tonight from the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project says that 72 percent of U.S. Internet users have gone online in the past year specifically for health-related information, and 77 percent of that group says their research started at Google, Bing or another general search engine.|1

One minute he was strutting around the end zone, staring into the stands, the look of a stone-cold killer in his eyes. The next, Golden Tate was tossing his helmet to the ground in a fit of frustration, stunned – like most everyone else in Ford Field – at what he’d just heard. The Detroit Lions had a win stolen from them in the cruelest of fashions Sunday, when Matthew Stafford appeared to throw the game-winning touchdown pass to Tate with 8 seconds left, only to have the score overturned on replay and the game ended by a mandatory 10-second clock runoff.|1
Amazon.com's purchase of Austin-based Whole Foods Market is showing up in the wine category. As this year ends, Amazon has shut down Wine.Woot and its own wine marketplace in favor of Whole Foods' expansive wine operation. Now that Amazon owns Whole Foods, a licensed seller of wine, it comes under different state laws and can't sell directly from a producer. As a result, Dallas entrepreneur Matt Rutledge sees an opening in the marketplace. When Amazon.com purchased daily deals site Woot.com, based in Carrollton, in 2010 it also acquired Wine.Woot, a direct producer-to-consumer website that Amazon adopted for its own wine marketplace.|1
Aged 63, Bowler was born in Kalgoorlie, completing his primary and secondary schooling in the region and spending most of his working life in the goldfields.

Every day leading up to the start of the 2017 prep football season, we'll feature a different Acadiana team. Catch up on all the previews right here. Rhett Peltier faced some very clear challenges when the Loreauville offensive coordinator took over the Tigers’ football program. Coming off an 8-3 season with a second-round exit in the Class 2A playoffs, only 17 players returned from the previous season, seven of whom were starters in 2016. Peltier now has 50 players on the roster, but 18 of those are freshmen. The new players, however, have bought into Peltier’s strategy.|1

Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child’s play, thanks to MIT. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a parser that imitates kids’ learning processes by observing the environment and making connections. The system studies captioned videos and learns to associate words with objects and actions. When given a new sentence, the parser can accurately predict its meaning—without visual clues. This “weakly supervised” approach, which requires limited training input, could expand the types of data and reduce the effort needed for training parsers. Annotations can certainly speed up the process, but they’re not needed to learn.|1

It has seemed for a while as though the global financial storm was going to deal a mostly glancing blow to the technology industry. Everybody hurts when markets go into free fall (and, as we're writing this on Wednesday afternoon, the Dow Jones has just closed down another 189 points -- although, as always, it could be up 500 points again by the time you read this). But if Wall Street and the banking sector are having a tornado rip through their gilded trailer parks, tech has, thus far, mostly just experienced some rain and a few gusts of wind in its relatively quiet suburb.|1

French President Emmanuel Macron wants to invigorate the European Union as a global power and spurn the populist nationalism that threatens to undermine its success. But he knows it requires cooperation with the United States—which makes his strange bedfellow in the White House so crucial to his agenda. This piece originally appeared in the Washington Post. Macron, who at 40 is three decades younger than Trump, disdains the president’s abrasive nature and many of his policies, notably on Iran and climate change. The French president prefers books, ideas and lofty intellectual conversation to the aggressive transactional style embodied by Trump, who favors television over written text.|1

Cryptocurrencies, outside of Bitcoin, have failed to garner much attention from buyers, and while the same can be said of sellers, the digestion of losses over the past month is likely to lead to more losses soon.

Weak price action in ETH/USD has it set up to make another leg lower soon. It could continue to drift ever-so-slightly higher, but the developing bear-flag implies risk is skewed more heavily towards the downside.|1

The University of Arkansas at Fort Smith recently told student Jennifer Braly that she was prohibited from giving lectures about being transgender to classes on campus, despite the fact that faculty were eager to feature her presentations.

Nintendo’s ancient Power Glove remains a part of popular culture because, one, it was an epic, ET: The Game-style failure and, two, because it was a power glove. There’s something about the mammalian brain that just likes the idea of being able to reach out and touch a digital objects — that is the point at which virtual worlds could become credible representations of the real world. Still, most attempts to recreate the power glove mentality, to let you use your hands to naturally manipulate digital objects in three dimensions, have been failures.|1

Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “Thank You” rally was the crowd’s silence when Trump mentioned that everyone should come together. The irony being that his campaign has been anything but unifying, which is why his supporters backed him.

We chose to question the narrative of history by simply quoting words which Churchill used himself.

COLOGNE CATHEDRAL SWITCHED off its light last night, in protest at the weekly anti-Islam rallies happening in Dresden. The symbolic act came as thousands of Germans demonstrated in Cologne and several other cities against the ongoing protests by the group calling itself Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West. PEGIDA attracted its biggest crowd yet in Dresden yesterday – more than 18,000 people. Cologne Cathedral provost Norbert Feldhoff, told n-tv that shutting down the lights was an attempt to make the PEGIDA demonstrators think twice about their protest. Only about 250 PEGIDA supporters showed up in Cologne, as compared to about ten times that number of counter-demonstrators.|1

For decades, aid groups have assumed they know what's best for refugees and the poor; a growing body of evidence suggests they're wrong. Both academic research and practical experience, such as with the mass of Syrians fleeing civil war, shows that simply handing out traditional relief goods may not be the most effective way of helping the dispossessed. Aid agencies are tentatively also giving away cash and letting refugees decide for themselves what they need. While the results may be unexpected, the money is being wisely spent and rarely wasted - contrary to old prejudices among donors.|1
German scientists working on the Wendelstein 7-X fusion device started a series of experiments that could eventually prove the superiority of their new reactor technology compared to conventional nuclear power plants. For the first time, scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the Institute for Fusion Energy and Science (IFE) in Germany began using a high-speed electron beam at an experimental device capable of producing 50 megawatts of electricity with no environmental impact. Scientists have already been running experiments at the Wendelstein 7-X since last year. If the experiment continues as planned, the results are expected in 2020.|0
In a democracy, it is said, we get the government we deserve. The same can be said about a society in which powerful people are free to exploit their power for personal gain, regardless of the good that is done or the bad that is endured by the public. I am not talking about mere corruption and cronyism as such ; I mean those who seek to control the political process and undermine the democratic processes through the use of influence and wealth. It seems that no matter how much money is spent to prevent them from achieving their goals, nothing will change.|0

Why Did This Woman Walk Away From Earning $ 600,000? It takes a lot of courage to quit your job, but not all workers can or would do it.

We can't trust anyone to be fair and accurate about what we hear on the news. Why don’t men like me? Some men have told me that it’s because they ‘just don’t find me sexually attractive. Sometimes, my female friends share those same feelings. And I understand their concerns. But there is another reason men don’t care about me—and it has nothing to do with my body or personality.|0

Damn, aside from Tom Tykwer desperately trying to get out of there at the 30 minute mark, and their publicist throwing out a bit of a burn towards DP at the very end, it was a great interview.

"School opened this week, so I thought this exploration would be appropriate and valuable. Recently, I was conducting a class on business communication, and a participant brought up what might be new trend in customer service. A similar idea had been suggested in an earlier MBA graduate class I was teaching, so I suspect there might be something going on in the business world that could be worth considering. Like most ""new"" items, this one has both good and bad aspects to it. The new trend relates to what is happening in large call centers."|1
One wonders which of the two best reflects the reality in Sussiya. Yossi Melman wants to know how to stop a terrorist operating on his own (“How to stop a lone wolf,” Analysis, July 18). The answer? You have to be winning a war, not losing it, so that the lone wolf sees he is on the losing side.

Recent Jewish visitors especially liked tracing their own origins right there at the museum, while non-Jewish visitors found the exhibits educational and engaging. Beit Hatfutsot is located on the Tel Aviv University campus about 5 miles north of the downtown area.|1
An extra $190,000 in state special education reimbursement funding that came in late last month has helped the town pay off its nearly half million-dollar settlement with the district's bus drivers union, officials said this week. Together with around $300,000 in savings found in the district's fiscal 2011 budget, the money has covered the town's $497,000 obligation to the drivers, whose jobs have been outsourced to a private busing company. The additional special education money, part of the state's circuit breaker program, will prevent the town from having to carry the debt over into fiscal 2012, officials said.|1

Kids and computers can be a beautiful mix or a disaster waiting to happen.

The new law finishes old business in Trenton and expands the so-called Tuition Equality Act, which let qualified immigrants pay in-state tuition. Going to college is not cheap these days. In fact, for many in New Jersey, it is unaffordable. Gov. Phil Murphy’s signing into law a bill that allows undocumented immigrants to apply for state financial aid to help pay for college beginning this fall won’t help all who hope to attend a post-secondary school, but it could help many. With Murphy’s signing, New Jersey becomes the 10th state to extend financial aid to undocumented college students.|1
Today marks the 314th anniversary of the last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. Geological records indicate that this 9.0 magnitude quake struck around 9 p.m. Jan. 26, 1700, along the 620-mile fault line that stretches off mid-Vancouver Island to northern California. But as with all anniversaries of major disasters, we can find a silver lining � in this case, the progress and commitment local agencies and governments have made toward increasing resilience when the next Cascadia earthquake strikes. Oregon�s offshore seismic fault mirrors the subduction zone that caused the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami that killed thousands of people and destroyed entire villages.|1

Where do we begin to try to describe this restaurant? Probably the best place is first to apologize for not writing more than a few sentences about it because I would have been lost in the experience. There's a big-picture sense, even if the actual details are often fuzzy. And there's a personal component: We all want to feel as if we're doing something that will make a difference. In my mind, the best way to get started with any cause is to find an organization that can give you some sense of direction.|0
McALLEN — School district trustees and top officials met with the local citizens league Thursday to cover the upcoming Tax Ratification Election proposal that will more than likely be put before the board next month. The lunch meeting at the McAllen Salvation Army was one of many similar presentations planned before the board’s vote to clarify what this election is about. If approved by the board, the election, known as TRE, will ask voters to allow the district to take all 11.5 pennies from the Interest and Sinking fund, known as I&S, and move these to the Maintenance and Operations side, or M&O.|1

Clinton said this week paid family leave is possible by taxing the wealthy but states have done so without soaking their citizens. When we are growing up, we expect that when we grow up, we can go out into the world and take care of ourselves. And I think a lot of people agree with that.

The Jawbone Up debuted last year with big ambitions: A bracelet-like device that you'd wear all the time, tracking how much you move and how well you sleep. Paired with an app, the Up helps you recognize patterns in your habits, empowering you to improve your health. One problem: It wasn't built to withstand the punishment of being a wearable device. Unlike a cellphone that resides in your pocket or a bag, the Up wraps around your wrist, exposed to the world just as much as your skin is. Many users found it quickly malfunctioned, and Jawbone recalled the Up and issued refunds.|1
"Firefighters more progressive in how we're using information to gear how we make our decisions within the community.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Water officials are not quite ready to declare an end to the drought in Utah, even though the state has its deepest snowpack in years.

The proposal that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to stem migration is nothing but 'hipster'colonialism. Last month, an African Union delegation was given a sneak preview of the plan during a trip to Nairobi when it was suggested that the African Union could buy land for $100,000 to $1 million per acre (approx. $7,000 to $22,400 per square meter) to stop the movement of people and goods between countries. The European Union has already been criticized for using this same technique to try and stop refugees trying to enter its territory.|0
Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of the NHS system, campaigners claim today. The Nuffield Trust claims that patients are being denied vital help when their weight puts them on a 'clinical obesity' threshold at which they must pay out-of-pocket premiums for treatment. In total, some 5m people in the UK are categorised as clinically obese, but this figure does not represent the true number of obese people because many will not admit to their condition. President Obama's new budget proposal is going to be a big deal.|0
SUNRISE, Fla. -- The New York Rangers weren't necessarily impressed with their performance Wednesday night, but they weren't going to complain about their bounce-back effort. Two nights after being shut out by the Tampa Bay Lightning and seeing goalie Henrik Lundqvist pulled, the Rangers rebounded with a 5-2 victory against the Florida Panthers. The Rangers appeared headed for an easy victory when they led 3-0 midway through the third period, but they had to respond after Florida cut the lead to 3-2 on goals by Scottie Upshall and Nick Bjugstad less than four minutes apart.|1

Teaching was a second career and since I was a young twenty something with a rent, I couldn't afford to do all of my learning before I got into the classroom. Back in those days it was called ""alternative route."" The wisdom was to place an extremely green teacher in a high-need school with a mentor and let them learn on the job rather than with a traditional program."|1

John Webster’s side raced into an early two-goal lead but were left hanging on through 90 minutes and then extra time as Heather fought back to level.

Assistant manager Andy Hill said: “I thought Heather were a very good footballing side, and it was a hard-fought win for us rather than a brilliant performance.|1

Tactically, in terms of crisis management, that was the right move — own the transgression and say unambiguously that you’re sorry.|1

It may be doing so because of claims by climate scientists that the company misled shareholders, investors and the public for decades about its knowledge of the risks posed by burning fossil fuels.|0

House Republicans weren ’ t talking about the economy as they left Washington for the August recess before a challenging schedule of votes. They’re instead looking at legislation that could have major consequences for their legislative agenda, including taxes, energy and health care.

Sunkett said the running back positions are still up from grabs and that the ground attack will be by committee, at least early in season. A young East St. Louis defensive unit gave up a lot of points a year ago. With three starters returning on the defensive line, a group of strong and quick linebackers and a secondary, which will be led by Thomas, the Flyers should be better this fall. Gone up front is all-American defensive end Terry Beckner Jr . — now at the University of Missouri — but LaMontre’ Harvey, Antuan Quinlin and Terres Lagrome, are quick agile linemen who return.|1

Boulder has sued the fossil fuel companies. Probably 15 percent or so of us would be alive today without fossil fuels since without them we would be living in the Middle Ages without medicines, electricity, real sanitation, etc. Those of us who did not die in childbirth or by an infection caused by a scratch could enjoy living a short life behind an animal pulling a wooden plow. Maybe it would be best if we recognize that fossil fuels had their role, evolve our power supplies to renewable, storable resources, and stop demonizing everyone.|1

Keep it classy. Cheer. Revel in a rival. And Yankees - keep it brief, a simple ceremony of appreciation. Sure, there will be temptation for fans to boo one of the faces of the Red Sox's championship seasons in 2004, 2007 and 2013.

Yes, there are some who speculate whether Ortiz did PEDs and won't like the idea of Ortiz being honored on the Stadium field because of that.|1
