The Volstead Act was repealed on this date in 1933, returning control of alcohol to the states, and it was a happy day at the F.X. Matt Brewery. UTICA, N.Y. -- A total of 85 years ago Wednesday marked the end of prohibition, which meant legally drinking beer again. And for the Matt family from Utica – that meant getting back to selling beer again. They let customers and suppliers know that at midnight, they could deliver, buy, and drink beer at the brewery once again. The local business managed to survive 13 years.|1
Technology ’ s continuing onslaught , and employees ’ responses to it , will be central issues for the American workforce in the decades ahead. There is a tendency to think of the Internet of Things , AI , cloud computing , big data analytics , and mobile devices as a kind of new generation of computer-based innovation. That would be an error. We are at the start of a shift in the nature and structure of the workplace and, by extension, of work itself. These developments, however, will transform work in the same way the industrial revolution transformed life and society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.|0

WASHINGTON – Congress is moving to put under military control all armed contractors operating in combat zones , a Pentagon proposal that could affect as many as 325,000 mercenaries who provide services ranging from security to military construction. Pentagon officials have estimated that the armed private security forces, which include former military personnel, now make up nearly 40 percent of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. The new Pentagon proposal, which is expected to be signed by Defense Secretary Robert Gates soon, would require mercenaries to operate under the same rules as the military, said a Defense official with knowledge of the plan.|0
"JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar : for the first time, women were about to be permitted to enter a space where they are currently barred. Hundreds of women and a few men stood patiently in line at the traditional women's plaza — the only area in which they can access the site — waiting to cross a security barrier into the area of the Western Wall known as ""the Kotel ha-Maharsha,"" or the men's section, which is separated by the barrier."|0

Over the next few months, many federal employees will receive performance ratings. Some may believe their ratings to be unreasonably low. What can be done? There is a review process for most employees, but that process generally functions within the agency’s control (with exceptions for bargaining unit employees and successful equal employment opportunity complainants) and is often criticized as being unfriendly to complaining employees. Nonetheless, an appeal might be successful if an employee is careful, thorough and able to strike the right notes. Appeals take numerous forms. Following is a summary of different groups of employees and how the processes may differ.|1

Have you heard the latest uproar? Of course you haven't - it's too loud. So say some residents who frequent downtown. Others say the bluster is louder than any motorcycle exhaust pipe. We say everyone should turn down the volume on complaining and let people go about their own business downtown. Also, let the police do their job. There is already a downtown noise ordinance in place, and the police reported to the city Tuesday that new measures are coming. First, the bikers."|1

Plushenko’s glorious career was finished. He had hoped to cap it at home after a comeback from spinal surgery, which he did, partially, by helping Russia win the team competition. But his 31-year-old back, after all those years of wrenching revolutions and hard landings, gave out two nights too soon. In essence, Plushenko sacrificed his chance at another individual medal to put his country on top. He was a longshot for gold, but in a sport of sequins and stuffed animals, he brought pugnacious sizzle. He was the James Cagney of the ice.|1

"The feud between California and the Trump administration grows as the president visits the California-Mexico border to inspect wall prototypes that will never be built. By the time Donald Trump visited the U.S. border with Mexico for the first time on Monday, he'd had the idea to build a wall between the two nations for months. His administration spent a week designating the border a national emergency. And he signed an executive order — on the ground in California — authorizing the construction of ""at least"" 33-feet-high walls along the border. Trump went to San Diego on Monday to inspect eight different ""prototypes."""|0
Certainly one of the most brilliant dialogues in the ballet is its pas de deux . It was danced excellently here, with a real sense of the dueling, competitive attraction between the male and female principals. (The dancers for the two lead roles are often double-casted.) For the entire first act the stage was set for a love-triangle, with the leading ballerina, Zhao Yi Ling, dancing the role of Kitri. But a little over an hour later, in the last scene of act one, she was changed into a man and danced as Basilio by one of the men, Hailong Dong.|0

The Geo Quiz has an American culinary twist this time. The city we want you to name was named after a French city, located on the banks of the Loire River. Its American counterpart is on the Mississippi. There's a lot of French and Cajun influence there. You can see it in the city's architecture, and taste it in its distinctive cuisine. But the food in this city is more than just crawfish etoufee' and beignets. Spanish, Italian, Native American and African culinary traditions are also part of the stew in this melting pot of flavors.|1

We chose to question the narrative of history by simply quoting words which Churchill used himself. At a glance, Blighty Café appears to be another one of those trendy and sophisticated coffee shops that offer the terribly appealing combination of tasteful beverages, off-beat music and the inviting aroma of freshly-baked sourdough bread.

Except, sitting in the mock air-raid shelter, drinking my flat white, I couldn’t help but feel ever more uncomfortable.|1
North Korean hacking group focuses attacks on aging and soon-to-be-deprecated technology. Five-Star hackers: High-end hotel data thieves return to target government officials The DarkHotel hacking group has returned -- but this time they're focusing on a different target, using a new strain of Inexsmar malware. Internet Explorer's scripting engine was the favorite target of a North Korean cyber-espionage group this year, after the hackers deployed two zero-days, but also crafted new exploits for two other older vulnerabilities. The group's name is DarkHotel, a cyber-espionage group that McAfee and many other cyber-security firms have already linked to the Pyongyang regime.|1
Following a team of international scientists , this film exclusively documents an archeological sensation : the exploration of royal tombs in Amara West, the ancient capital of Kush in present Sudan. For centuries, the ruins of the city of Amara remained hidden in sand dunes. An expedition from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia recently uncovered the first of these tombs. The tombs are lavishly decorated, the finds are unprecedented and include gold jewellery and bronze statues. The discoveries raise hopes of exciting new insights into the rise of the first African empire and into the history of the African civilisations from antiquity.|0
It's hard to imagine that 2001: A Space Odyssey would have its incredible cinematic impact without that classical soundtrack. But director Stanley Kubrick originally hired a composer to score the film, only to abandon the score in postproduction. Kubrick tapped Alex North, who had scored a number of classic films, including Kubrick's own Spartacus, to write the 2001 score. Kubrick deemed the score inadequate for the film, and replaced it with the classical musical tracks that are so familiar today. North wasn't aware of the change until the film premiered.|1

MONTREAL — In the 19th century, the French-language novel was the mainstay of Quebec publishing. In the 20th century, poetry took over.

I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad’s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should not constantly be called to account for the vicious behaviour of IS. Still less to be stigmatised until unnamed Muslim leaders disowned it. I was disconcerted to see so many Eureka Street readers appeared to agree with the demands against which she protested. Both Ruby’s complaint and the responses to it reminded me of the attitudes taken to Catholics in an earlier generation. The popular charges against Catholics were honed in the Great War and particularly by the referenda on Conscription.|1

"Under Trump , presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor .

Until further guidance is issued, USCIS is temporarily applying interim procedures to H-1B non-profit entity petitions filed with the agency seeking an exemption from the statutory H-1B numerical cap based on an affiliation with or relation to an institution of higher education, an official announcement said. Effective immediately, during this interim period USCIS will give deference to prior determinations made since June 6, 2006, that a non-profit entity is related to or affiliated with an institution of higher education – absent any significant change in circumstances or clear error in the prior adjudication – and, therefore, exempt from the H-1B statutory cap.|1
In the age of Instagram, food is no longer designed to just be food. It’s a set piece, a lifestyle statement of fantastical hyperbole. So we drink unicorn lattes, eat rainbow bagels, and lick our charcoal-black soft serve in front of neon signs. Food is no longer about eating. It’s about the documentation of unattainable perfection, catching the next ever-illusive meme. Yet in this new wave of food-as-influencer, there is a single, curmudgeonly brand that insists on photographing its dishes on conference room tables, under fluorescent lighting, and from all sorts of unflattering angles.|1

"The proposal that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to stem migration is nothing but 'hipster' colonialism. Last week, Germany's Africa Commissioner Gunter Nooke said that European countries should be allowed to lease land and to build and run cities in Africa as a means of stemming what he views as the unchecked expansion of migration from Africa to Europe. For Nooke, allowing the ""free development"" of these areas would stimulate African economies and create ""growth and prosperity"" and therefore, reduce the attractiveness of Europe as a destination for migration. The proposal has elicited mixed reactions."|1

I thought I was an acceptable kind of evangelical. I'm not a fundamentalist. My friends and I enjoy art, alcohol, and cultural engagement. We avoid spiritual clichés and buzzwords.

We could disagree about truth, spirituality, and morality, and remain on the best of terms. The failures of the church often made me more uncomfortable than those in the broader culture.|1

Most people have heard of Scrooge, even if they have never read A Christmas Carol or any other work of Charles Dickens, writes Adrian Hattrell.

Clinton said this week paid family leave is possible by taxing the wealthy but states have done so without soaking the rich. In her opening statement at the first Democratic debate Tuesday, Hillary Clinton mentioned the need for paid family leave, and when asked about it later, she said it was possible to pay for it by having the wealthy foot the bill. The line may be good fodder for Democrats, but looking at how states have done it, as well as current national proposals, show other ways to pay for the policy without soaking the rich.|1

Ryanair has lowered its full year profit guidance from a current range of €1.25-€1.35 billion to a new range of €1.15-€1.20 billion. The reduction comes in the wake of two profit warnings issued by Ryanair during the summer, the first of which was the result of higher fuel prices. The airline has already cut full year capacity growth forecasts from a current range of 6-8% to a new range of 4-6%, and has warned that it will now only be able to grow full year profit by 3% rather than 10%.|0
The AKP should take comfort in its large majority and start to view minority views and even peaceful dissent benignly. This would be a major change in the political climate for Turkey and would go a long way to reassuring the US, the EU and the International Community that the AKP is not a totalitarian regime but a responsible political party that recognises the legitimacy of its opposition. At the end of this article you will see how far the AKP has to go before it can claim to be a genuine political party that can be relied upon in times of crisis.|0
"The right sheet set and pajamas can help you stay cool. Today’s memory-foam mattresses don't sleep as ""hot"" as older models did, thanks to air-circulating layers and ventilated toppers that keep the foam from absorbing and retaining all your body heat. But a certain insulating effect is unavoidable when you're sleeping on a foam block. If your memory foam mattress leaves you sweating at night, a few remedies can help turn down the heat -- if only by a few degrees. Anything you can do to distance your body from the memory foam will help keep you cool."|1
While the SP-BSP-RLD alliance may disrupt the caste math in many pockets, the Congress is relegated to the role of a vote-splitter.

As eight constituencies go to polls on Thursday, ET takes a closer look into what’s turning into a seat-to-seat battle. While the SP-BSP-RLD alliance may disrupt the caste math in many pockets, the Congress is relegated to the role of a vote-splitter.

"Sunkett said the running back positions are still up from grabs and that the ground attack will be by committee with the three running backs all getting the same number of carries.

The biggest question for the Panthers is which quarterback will get the most playing time, if not the majority.

In recent years, platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their artistry. For the generation of designers who grew up playing “Super Mario Bros.” platformers offer a sound formula. Though the goal of such games is usually to get from one area to the next, that framework supports copious possibilities. Determining how a character moves through a world and what sorts of things should impede or assist in the process allows plenty of room for creativity. It is why games like “Journey” and “Inside” can both be constructed around jumping avatars but otherwise appear quite distinct.|1

I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad ’ s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should be proud to be Australian (‘We are Muslims and We are Australian’, February 3). I would like to suggest a couple of other things for Muslims to be proud of. I would like to remind Muslims that their religion teaches compassion and forgiveness and that these are two things that are at the heart of Christian teaching, as well. We are told in Matthew 6, “Judge not so as to be judged. For the one judging, he is judged.|0
The British are known for their collective stiff upper lip . The elements of British style translate easily in every aspect of our lives, from home décor to fashion to our personalities. In the 17th century, British style was the ultimate in fashion. The English had perfected tailoring of clothes, and their tailors traveled the world creating wardrobe for royals from all over. Their clothes were the epitome of style and quality. Elegance is key to British style, no matter the setting. It is evident in how British people dress and the decor of their homes.|0

Rather than corresponding to a massive, cosmic event, today’s news focused on the sub-atomic level.|1

Why do we only hear about Jasper Johns when he gets ripped off ?

Every time he comes up for sale, I get a little twitchy. I am not saying the paintings he is selling nowadays are great art, although I believe they are, but he is an artist and every time he shows his face I start to worry. There are a number of reasons this should make you nervous.|0
The five-storied 'Farhad Mansion' resembles any other well-maintained house in an affluent neighbourhood of Chittagong city. Yet no gatekeeper guards any of the two steel gates that lead to the small front yard and the stairway of the building. With the summer holidays, it is not surprising that the ground and fourth floors that house an English medium school are deserted. But even the residential second and third floors show no signs of life. Climbing to the top, the locked grilled-gate to the roof is reached. Standing there, one cannot help but shudder, imagining what had happened there on April 27, 2012.|1
I thought I was an acceptable kind of evangelical . I 'm not a fundamentalist . My friends and I read the Bible and try to be good . We pray together .

As a federal contractor, Google is required to permit the government to inspect records relevant to its compliance with equal opportunity laws.|1

One 15-year-old girl from Russia loved sharing her image on social media. She would take selfies whenever the mood struck her, which was often, and then share them via her phone with her friends, followers, and the world at large.

Known as a “ floating fest , ” Lake Wylie Music Fest has performers on land at a private residence and water performers in pontoon boats on the lake. Because there is no stage in the water, performances are limited to what can fit on the boats — and there is limited seating for spectators.

There will be 10 musical performers throughout the day, and several others will provide their art in painting, sculpture, and photography.|0

So can you tell the difference between those dB levels? In my tests, I could indeed hear Chipolo Plus a little bit better than the other trackers, though the difference is subtle.|1

National Geographic, usually known for photos of animals and the adventures of rich people visiting other countries, is premiering their Will Smith-narrated, Darren Aronofsky-produced series, One Strange Rock, on March 26. I had a chance to watch one of the episodes at a screener last month - it was fine and very wide-eyed. There were lots of shots of Earth from space.|1

One minute he was strutting around the end zone, staring into the stands, the look of a stone-cold killer in his eyes. The next, Golden Tate was tossing his helmet to the ground in a fit of frustration, stunned – like most everyone else in Ford Field – at what he’d just heard. The Detroit Lions had a win stolen from them in the cruelest of fashions Sunday, when Matthew Stafford appeared to throw the game-winning touchdown pass to Tate with 8 seconds left, only to have the score overturned on replay and the game ended by a mandatory 10-second clock runoff.|1
SUNRISE, Fla. -- The New York Rangers weren't necessarily impressed with their performance Wednesday night, but they weren't going to complain about their bounce-back effort. Two nights after being shut out by the Tampa Bay Lightning and seeing goalie Henrik Lundqvist pulled, the Rangers rebounded with a 5-2 victory against the Florida Panthers. The Rangers appeared headed for an easy victory when they led 3-0 midway through the third period, but they had to respond after Florida cut the lead to 3-2 on goals by Scottie Upshall and Nick Bjugstad less than four minutes apart.|1

I agree that the President does have a problem, but that’s because the American public is starting to catch on. Americans don’t want to pay more. They don’t want government control. They don’t think it will cover everyone. In other words, they don’t like this plan. So what’s a President to do?"|0

New Jersey hits day three of its government shutdown Monday over a budget stalemate that's closed state parks — and will likely force the furlough of 35,000 workers. On Sunday, the impasse even inconvenienced Gov. Chris Christie, forcing him to leave a state beach that was on shutdown to the public — but open to his family — because he had to return to Trenton. All nonessential services remained closed as the Republican governor and the Democratic Assembly speaker continued to disagree over Christie's plan for a nonprofit health system that is at the center of the budget dispute.|1

"What will happen to a living organism placed in a state of quantum superposition ? September 22 , 2015 , 10:30 AM
Quantum mechanics describes the physics of very small particles. When quantum particles are viewed, or “observed”, their physical state changes and the particles behave as if they are in a superposition of their state before and after “observation”. For example, a particle may have an energy state of 9 and 11. It is impossible to define the particle’s energy state without a measurement. Once it is measured, the particle is found to be in either 9 or 11."|0

Considering all the comings and goings of people involved in the project, we should be grateful that Bohemian Rhapsody has finally landed on the big screen.

WASHINGTON — House Democrats on Friday unveiled a comprehensive elections and ethics reform package that targets what they call a “culture of corruption in Washington” and aims to reduce the role of money in politics.

Media & Entertainment I write about women in the business of Hollywood. New research released today from the Geena Davis Institute on Gender and Media shows that we have a long way to go in our depictions of girls and women onscreen in family-friendly movies.

The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep . That is the provocative implication of a new survey that found the most important financial decisions made by retirees are not so much driven by financial considerations. The study, conducted by Fidelity Investments, finds that retirees typically make major financial choices in their later years based on their own happiness and well-being, including a preference for living with a small amount of financial worry rather than a big financial nest egg. This preference for happiness and well-being appears more pronounced for those who are wealthy.|0

Under Trump, presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor. Since discovering that the constitution gives him the somewhat controversial power to absolve criminals who are also his friends, Donald Trump has pardoned more people and commuted more sentences in his first 18 months in office than any of his three immediate predecessors. The pardoning spree continued on Tuesday, as Trump issued two more before jetting off to Europe to stomp all over NATO, this time clearing the names of father-son arsonist duo Dwight and Steven Hammond, Oregon cattle ranchers whose 2016 fight against the federal government became a conservative cause célèbre.|1
I have written previously about my own pets, and the most common prompt for me to do this has been when my own animals have reached the end of their lives. For me, it has been a type of grief therapy sometimes, with the opportunity to write an obituary for an animal that's been an important part of my life. This week, the good news is that this is not an obituary. One of my two cats, Couscous, has been unwell, but so far, treatment has been successful, so this is a tale about her illness, not about her death.|1

SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) - Water officials are not quite ready to declare an end to the drought along the Colorado River in the Southwest but say it has gotten better in recent months - enough that they're calling on the seven states in the basin to voluntarily reduce their use by about 15 percent through 2018. If that's not enough to avert a shortage declaration in 2019, then the states will face mandatory cutbacks and possibly even rationing that could have major economic impacts in cities such as Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz., that depend on Colorado River water.|0

In the next three years, the Royal Navy would turn the invincible Armada into the forgotten Armadillo . The story of this remarkable achievement is here related by the world's foremost authority on British naval affairs during this time.|0

The Australian telecommunications (telco) industry is largely responsible for the highly connected and digital world we live in today. Their networks and services have fostered professional work environments and have brought together family and friends amidst Australia’s vast distances, and remote global position.

In fact Accenture, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, has estimated that digitalisation could contribute approximately $100 trillion in value to the telecommunications industry over the next decade globally. Australian telecommunications operators have long maintained vast networks, held together by complex infrastructure.|1

When Pacers coach Frank Vogel announced he would sit all five starters for last night 's game against the Bucks, I wrote that he was taking a huge risk. The Pacers, who entered the game 0-5 against Western Conference teams, desperately needed to pick up that first win to stay on track for a top four seed in the Eastern Conference. Vogel 's decision could wind up being the biggest coaching blunder of his five-year coaching career to date, but even if he got lucky, it still could be a costly risk to take at this point of his career and the team 's season.|0
"Surgical Strike Day: State Education minister Partha Chatterjee yesterday criticised the central government alleging that the UGC's direction on 'Surgical Strike Day' is a part of the BJP's ""agenda"". Surgical Strike Day: The Narendra Modi government at the Centre and ruling Trinamool Congress dispensation headed by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee seems to be heading into a fresh rift, this time over the University Grants Commission’s (UGC) directive to varsities on Thursday and higher educational institutions across the country to observe September 29 as “Surgical strike day”."|1

"You have to give Square Enix points for honesty; Bravely Default: For the Sequel wears its primary intentions right on its sleeve. I mean, it's right in the title: ""For the Sequel."" The new updated version of the original Bravely Default: Flying Fairy is currently being developed in parallel to the game's upcoming as-of-yet untitled sequel. However, unlike your standard updated rerelease of a game, Square Enix is looking to use For the Sequel as a testing bed for the sequel (Christ, how many times am I going to have to use that term.)."|1
It has seemed for a while as though the global financial storm was going to deal a mostly glancing blow on the U.S. housing sector. But now it looks as though the financial turmoil will make landfall on housing, possibly with a direct hit. For the last 2-3 weeks the housing sector seemed to have recovered from the shock of the mortgage market collapse, and began to rebound. The median price of existing single family homes sold nationally increased for the second month in a row in September, and home sales were up slightly.|0

In developed capitalist democracies , financial , media and energy companies are private enterprises that don ’ t report to the government of their respective countries. These sectors are regulated by government bodies. The government of developed democracies has an open market policy where they encourage competition from the private sector and at the same time limit government intervention and regulations. Unfortunately, these policies have created a situation where monopolistic and cartel tendencies have developed in financial, media and energy corporations. This results in these corporations using their political clout and influence in the government to get favourable regulation.|0
Will an upcoming vote in Congress signal the end of Medicare? In the next few weeks Congress will decide whether to cut $54 billion in overpayments to Medicare insurers, igniting a battle that may well determine whether the program survives. On one side are Medicare supporters, who want it to continue as a successful social insurance program. On the other is the insurance industry, which is spending millions and lobbying hard to put Medicare on a fast track to privatization, a goal long sought by fiscal conservatives and their allies in right-wing think tanks.|1

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Water officials are not quite ready to declare an end to the drought in Utah, even though the state has its deepest snowpack in years. This year’s statewide snowpack ranks substantially better than 2017, and almost as good as the banner years of 2005 and 2011, federal hydrologists said in a water report made public Thursday. The water stored in the snowpacks of San Juan, Grand and eastern Uintah counties was 207% above normal as of Thursday, and was 191% above normal for southwestern Utah, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service.|1
Northside Step Team performs at Seattle Theatre Group’s Global Dance Party at the Moore Theater. She directs the Northside Step Dance Team in Shoreline, and last year, her team used their dance routine to protest the police shootings of unarmed black people. Step dancing has a rich cultural history. It became popular in the United States in the early 1900s at historically black colleges and universities. But it started even farther back. “It started historically back in Africa with certain tribes using it, and then through slavery as a way of communication, so there’s a lot of call and response,” Darnesha said.|1
A Manitoba woman has been sent to prison for hiding the remains of six infants in a rented storage locker, but court never heard an explanation as to what prompted her to hide the babies she conceived over many years. Andrea Giesbrecht, 43, bit her lip and looked straight ahead, but showed little emotion as she was sentenced Friday to 8 1/2 years. Provincial court Judge Murray Thompson said Giesbrecht’s moral culpability was extreme and the sentence needed to be strong enough to denounce her behaviour. “These were newly delivered infants, our most vulnerable,” Thompson said in his decision that was livestreamed by Winnipeg media.|1

Let ’ s dispense with the question of whether Democrat Ralph Northam is being treated unfairly . His grievous political offense to many Virginians, especially women, was his support of abortion rights and a long-gun ban in the state . It may be true that Northam did not have to take those positions and that they could have hurt his campaign. But let’s not pretend that the Republicans are the only guilty ones. They aren’t. Many Democrats – including many self-proclaimed moderate Democrats – are equally culpable . The Democratic base is just as radicalized on these issues as the Democratic left.|0
With the lessons of 2014 fresh in their collective memory and the 2016 election cycle about to start, progressive groups and Democrats have been making a sustained push to highlight policies to boost incomes for the poor and middle class and fight income inequality. The Democrats on the House Budget Committee outlined a plan in January to create a $1,000 tax credit for every worker making less than $100,000 annually, financed by eliminating some tax exemptions and deductions for high earners. The Center for American Progress released a series of policy recommendations for “ensuring that middle- and lower-income households are the substantial beneficiaries” of economic growth.|1

But the Frenchman’s contract with Manchester United expires at the end of the season , and he may look to move for more first-team football elsewhere in the New Year.|0
Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child’s play, thanks to MIT. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a parser that imitates kids’ learning processes by observing the environment and making connections. The system studies captioned videos and learns to associate words with objects and actions. When given a new sentence, the parser can accurately predict its meaning—without visual clues. This “weakly supervised” approach, which requires limited training input, could expand the types of data and reduce the effort needed for training parsers. Annotations can certainly speed up the process, but they’re not needed to learn.|1

Beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl is never easy . When they scored 21 points the first three times they touched the ball and held the ball for nearly half of the third quarter, it was clear it was not going to be easy in this one either . But the Ravens held the Pats to just two points in the second half and then came from 17 points back to win on a Joe Flacco 11-yard touchdown pass to rookie tight end Nick Boyle with 35 seconds left in the game.

Boulder has sued the fossil fuel companies . Probably 15 percent or so of us would be alive today without the automobile. The idea of biking everywhere just didn't catch on in those early decades after the first auto was sold in 1896. They were very slow, heavy vehicles. You didn't want to be in one for long periods of time, and certainly not in winter weather! We don't need the gas-guzzling machines today. They serve no reasonable transportation need. They're also bad for the climate, polluting the air and releasing carbon dioxide with every mile they drive.|0

The first image of Earth from lunar orbit. Before an Apollo-era NASA could launch a few humans on top of a rocket and plop them down on the moon, it needed to find safe places to land. So from 1966 through 1967, the space agency launched five spacecraft, which it creatively named Lunar Orbiters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Lunar Orbiter 1 was the first to swing around the moon. It automatically took film photos, processed and scanned them, then beamed the images back as radiowaves to receivers on Earth, where technicians recorded them onto analog data tapes.|1
"John Bennett ( July 20 ) , a teacher at Westside Middle School , was upset by the School Board's decision to eliminate his position due to budget constraints. ""We are going to lose a valuable resource here,"" said the English Language Arts teacher. ""It's just not fair."" Due to the economy and declining state funding , the school board voted on Wednesday, June 17, to eliminate the fifth of 10 positions from the current budget. The cuts will save the school system $36,545, which was part of a $221,545 savings."|0
Boeing ’ s latest setback , a deal between Tesla and Fiat Chrysler , and Pinterest ’ s valuation were among the most discussed over the past 72 hours. Boeing is taking a $4 billion aftermath of two fatal accidents with its 737 MAX 8 planes, including the tragic crash in Ethiopia that killed all 157 passengers and crew, and the Lion Air that killed 189.

Black Starlets coach Samuel Fabin says his side were not threatened at any point in their convincing win over India in the ongoing Sub-Junior Men’s AFC Championship in Bangladesh. “India never made a threat and we didn’t expect them to come back from the half time,” Fabin said after his side beat hosts Bangladesh 4-0. He also said he was surprised that his wards conceded a penalty at the death of the game. “We should have defended very well and prevented India from conceding a penalty at the death”.|0
NSA Director General Keith Alexander maintains that his agency 's tactics are lawful and used against foreign adversaries . The National Security Agency defended its secret surveillance of Americans’ phone records and Internet activity on Thursday, insisting its practices are not only lawful, but necessary to prevent another terrorist attack like the 2001 strikes on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Five days after The Guardian published a leaked top-secret NSA document describing the agency’s program to gather phone records and other data in bulk, NSA Director General Keith Alexander was grilled for a full two hours in front of the Senate’s intelligence committee.|0

Will an upcoming vote in Congress signal the end of Medicare ? In the next few weeks Congress will decide whether or not to raise the federal debt limit. This debt has been accumulating since the New Deal when FDR passed the original Medicare Act. This debt will soon be more than $15 trillion in the hole. Medicare now stands at $30 billion a year in the red. It will be $50 billion in the hole by 2015. This deficit can only be sustained so long. If the Congress raises the debt limit, it can continue to operate as it does now.|0
"John Bennett(July 20), a teacher at Westside Middle School, was upset by the School Board's decision to have teachers teach all sides of any controversy. He is right, of course, that pretending all sides of any controversy are equally valid is nonsense. But a good deal of the issue hinges on our definition of ""teaching"" a position. If ""teaching"" means that the teacher merely presents all sides of a controversy as though they were equal in weight and legitimacy, then we are being equal time indoctrinists."|1

When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher , only the deepest , most corrosive cynicism is possible . Trampling on people’s rights is acceptable, only in the name of justice and equality for the minority community. The truth is, this is not about justice and equality for Dalits , this is about political opportunism . The Jat reservation agitation and its subsequent fall-out in the form of a complete shutdown of the railways is a result of what many believe to be an opportunistic decision by the opposition parties , which was taken to embarrass the current UPA government .|0

LITCHFIELD, Maine (AP) — A Maine woman is trying to protect a series of osprey nests atop power poles that are threatened by a $1.55 billion project to modernize the state's power distribution system. But so far Rebecca Loveland of Litchfield has been unsuccessful in her campaign to spare the nests or at least provide alternatives for the big birds' homes. Poles supporting the nests will be removed as part of Central Maine Power Company's modernization effort known as the Maine Power Reliability Project. Loveland tells the Kennebec Journal at least 60 osprey nests will be removed.|1

"The battle over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ’ s new “ borrower education tool ” unveiled earlier this week was predictably fierce. In fact, it’s not much of a stretch to say that if it was left to the two parties involved, it might be called the “battle between the bully and the whimp.”
In one corner, you’ve got a tough-as-nails agency that’s seen its funding slashed in an attempt to render it impotent, and which is currently facing an unprecedented legal challenge to the very notion that it exists at all."|0
BOB Cole died yesterday. Around 2pm in a purpose-built flat on a Swiss industrial estate outside Zurich, he said goodbye to his friends, and went to sleep for the last time. He was 68, terminally ill, and was taking his life into his own hands, as around 30 Britons do each year at the Dignitas. His wife, Pam, was one of them. She was suffering from progressive supernuclear palsy, a fatal brain disease, and faced a terrible death. In February last year she died as Chris de Burgh’s Here is Your Paradise played at her bedside.|1

"That's how I would characterize my minimal pre-service time. Fortunately and unfortunately though, I had very little time before my theoretical learning and my practical experience collided. Teaching was a second career and since I was a young twenty something with a rent, I couldn't afford to do all of my learning before I got into the classroom. Back in those days it was called ""alternative route."" The wisdom was to place an extremely green teacher in a high-need school with a mentor and let them learn on the job rather than with a traditional program."|1
The ex-girlfriend of the football star whose plane disappeared has spoken out — making a sensational claim about who is behind the crash. Argentine football player Emiliano Sala's light aircraft has gone missing over the English Channel. He had recently signed for premier league team Cardiff City from French team Nantes. Emiliano Sala’s model ex-girlfriend is claiming that the “football mafia” is behind the doomed plane crash in the Channel.

Bavarian farmers are angry that their famous Alpine dairy cows will apparently have to wear nappies under European Union environmental plans. The EU is planning a new environmental package that includes an animal-health strategy. It includes a plan to reduce the EU's greenhouse-gas emissions, and part of this includes an animal-health policy to prevent diseases and make sure there is a supply of raw material for meat and dairy products. However, the farmers say that part of the animal-health plan could cause them major problems, particularly regarding dairy cows and Alpine sheep.|0
Who pulled the plug on the canal this time? It’s winter, and we’re certainly not in the middle of a drought, so what’s happened to this stretch of the Grand Union Canal? The Cooks Wharf area of the canal appears to have drained away again, just four months after the same section was left bereft of water. The area sits just outside Cheddington on the way to Marsworth. In August there was a similar scene after a boater left a lock gate paddle open – the gates control the flow of water in the lock.|1

With the economic noose poised to tighten around Iran over its suspect nuclear program , the Tehran regime is shaking up the country's oil industry. It has pushed the Oil Ministry, which is dominated by the mullahs, out of direct control over the operations of the country's National Petrochemical Company (NPC). The decision was announced earlier this month by Ali Akbar Mehrabian, the minister for the country's oil and gas industry. According to this report, the NPC was created in 1997 to handle the entire country's petrochemicals operation.|0
PHILADELPHIA, PA (TheSpread) – Rashad Evans got the last laugh in his beef with Tito Ortiz on Saturday at UFC 133 as Evans beat Ortiz by second round TKO in the main event.

One of the top Chairmen for Joe Straus, Charlie Geren, has pushed a bill (SB 346) through the Texas House that, like the recent Obama IRS scandal, would attack Texas conservative non-profit groups by demanding that they reveal who gives money to them.

Syrian sources said April 14 that the Jordanian charge d'affaires in Lebanon, Hisham Moheisen, who was kidnapped from his residence Feb. 6, had been released in the Lebanese resort town of Shtoura. Monitor Mideast correspondent John Yemma reports that there was no immediate Western or Jordanian confirmation of this development. But several Lebanese media sources reported that Mr. Moheisen had been found -- one saying he was picked up by the Syrian Arab Deterrent Force near the besieged town of Zahle. Jordan has blamed Syria for the abduction. The two countries have had severely strained relations for almost six months and nearly went to war late last year.|1
"(CNN) -- Thousands of people in Northern Ireland protested Wednesday against the killing of two soldiers and a policeman, reportedly by paramilitaries who want the province to leave the United Kingdom and become part of the Republic of Ireland. Girls in Craigavon, where the police officer was killed, join a candlelit vigil. Unions organized a 30-minute silent vigil following the shooting of policeman Stephen Carroll on Monday and British soldiers Cengiz ""Pat"" Azimkar and Mark Quinsey on Saturday. Vigils were held in Belfast, Craigavon -- where Carroll died -- and other towns including Lisburn and Newry."|1
A jaunt through October's art highlights. Eighty-eight-year-old Jack McLarty has had a distinguished career, with an exhibition history stretching back to the 1940s and artworks housed in collections such as the Smithsonian Institution's. His paintings this month at Broderick show evidence of his fascination with Central and South America. A riot of tropicalia, The Garden of Good and Evil is all parrots, crucifixes, Dia de los Muertos skulls and anacondas wrapped around naked women's legs. The best of McLarty's works have a kooky exuberance, executed with a neo-Impressionist technique and a folk artist's naivetÉ.|1

The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep. That is the provocative implication of recent research that examined investors’ financial risk-taking following periods when their sleep was disrupted. I concede that advice to get more sleep is hardly new, since we’ve been hearing that most of our lives — and the advice is honored more in the breach than in the observance. Furthermore, retirees typically would like to sleep more, but can’t — due to the disruptions in sleep patterns that are a normal part of the aging process.|1
Two years ago , Red Sox prospect Ryan Westmoreland seemed to be on the fast track to the majors . Now he’s on the fast track to surgery . The 20-year-old right-hander’s doctors discovered a cavernous malformation in his brain and said it needed to be surgically removed. Red Sox GM Ben Cherington released the following statement: “I know he’s a terrific young man, a terrific player … and this is obviously a very tough setback. … The good news is that [the lesion] was located in the part of his brain that controls balance and memory, so that’s obviously a positive.|0
For decades, aid groups have assumed they know what's best for refugees and the poor; a growing body of evidence suggests they're wrong. Both academic research and practical experience, such as with the mass of Syrians fleeing civil war, shows that simply handing out traditional relief goods may not be the most effective way of helping the dispossessed. Aid agencies are tentatively also giving away cash and letting refugees decide for themselves what they need. While the results may be unexpected, the money is being wisely spent and rarely wasted - contrary to old prejudices among donors.|1
Promises to replace houses sold off under the Right to Buy scheme look increasingly hollow as the Government slashes council houses' sale price to a third of the cost of replacements. The Government is now selling off council homes at an average price of £59,000, down from over £80,000 before they came to power, a BuzzFeed analysis has shown. The government is selling off the country's remaining council homes at lower prices than ever before despite a soaring housing market. Social tenants have had the 'Right to Buy' their homes at a large discount since Margaret Thatcher introduced the policy in 1980.|1
In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don’t report to presidents. In Russia, things are different. Most of those businesses are majority-state-owned corporations, virtual branches of the government. And that means when you talk to the head of a Russian bank or oil company, you are effectively talking to the Kremlin. In 2000, when Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency, he consolidated competing power centers — media, business, local government, opposition parties and the Parliament — under his authority. He called it “a vertical of power.” This system now includes organized crime and cybercriminals.|1
Herbert Davis and MRA are looking to get back to the title game after failing to do so for the first time last season. Herbert Davis has been MRA’s head football coach since 1990. MRA’s record during that span? 203-68, an astonishing .745 winning percentage. Since he took over at Montgomery Rodgers Academy, the Knights have won eight 3A state championships (1993, ’94, ’95, ’97, ’98, ’99, ’02, ’05) and lost eight state title games.|0
Toronto - A Porter Airlines Dash 8 with 54 on board encountered a UFO at a height of about 9,000 feet as it was making its descent into the Billy Bishop Airport on Toronto Islands. In a statement Porter Airlines said: “The pilots noticed an object in the distance (and) as they approached the object, they realized it was very close to their flight path.” The pilots at first thought the object was a balloon but after debriefing decided it could have been a drone. At this stage the object has not been identified.|1
When I opened the brown clasp envelope and pulled out the 21-page spiral book, I was startled. Dr. Jones is not a pianist. I’ve been having a good laugh at myself about it these last few weeks. (I guess I really do need hearing aids.) I told the story when I spoke to the Barrington Hall Garden Club last week, and the ladies got a chuckle out of it. Dr. Jones is passionate about peonies. At one time, he had 120 peony plants blooming in the backyard of his former home on Hillandale Circle.|1
Fast bowler Matt Hobden has been tipped for a bright future as he bids to bounce back from one of the darkest days in his fledgling career. Hobden’s encouraging start to the season came to a grinding halt in the previous Championship match against Middlesex at Hove. The 22-year-old from Eastbourne lost his rhythm completely as he committed 11 no-balls in 16 overs in the first innings and another three in the second. His struggles were highlighted by an injury to Ajmal Shahzad on the opening day which prevented skipper Ed Joyce from withdrawing him from the attack.|1

Where will he wake up next ? A prison cell ? A tropical hammock ? Or suspended on a cliff ? If you don't know how this happens, I'll explain it later. But if you do know, keep reading, because I'm gonna make it up as I go. As you can see in the picture he is still sleeping, and that is where you come in.

Today marks the 314th anniversary of the last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. Geological records indicate that this 9.0 magnitude quake struck around 9 p.m. Jan. 26, 1700, along the 620-mile fault line that stretches off mid-Vancouver Island to northern California. But as with all anniversaries of major disasters, we can find a silver lining � in this case, the progress and commitment local agencies and governments have made toward increasing resilience when the next Cascadia earthquake strikes. Oregon�s offshore seismic fault mirrors the subduction zone that caused the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami that killed thousands of people and destroyed entire villages.|1
PASSENGERS are now banned from drinking alcohol purchased from duty free shops under new rules. It's hoped that the initiative will tackle the increasing number of in-flight incidents and disruptions caused by drunken travellers. The new policy has been introduced by World Duty Free, according to The Times, who own most of the duty free shops in airports across the UK. Any alcohol bought by passengers in any of its shops will be given in sealed bags, which must remain sealed until they leave the flight. All alcohol will be included - from beer and wine to spirits - no matter what size they are.|1
To most NBA experts, players and fans, Kobe Bryant is one of the top 20 best players of all time and one of the top five guards the league has ever produced. To some, he is second only to Michael Jordan and to a third, out there, group he is the best of all time. To get the first group of people to consider agreeing with the second (I leave out the third because nobody seriously believes that is ever possible), Kobe Bryant has to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a championship this season.|1

Ronaldo, 33, leads the competition’s scoring charts for a remarkable fifth year in a row and a goal against Liverpool in Kiev will see him surpass Di Stefano and become the only player to score in four European Cup finals.|1
Salad may be an overlooked part of the holiday meal, but it doesn’t have to be that way, thanks to this beautiful salad that’s robust enough to stand up to the rest of the meal. Wrap each beet in foil and set on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast for 50 to 60 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a paring knife. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes. While the beets cool, increase the oven to broil. Arrange the citrus segments in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet, then sprinkle with the brown sugar.|1

What Steve Lonegan can teach Republicans about making life hell for Democrats. New Jersey Senate candidate Steve Lonegan may not beat Cory Booker, but his run offers some interesting lessons for Republicans. I’m betting that the candidate with the poll lead, higher favorables, and more experienced campaign team will, indeed, win, but I’m interested in how the race has become a test kitchen for attacks on liberals. Steve Lonegan, Booker’s opponent, is running his third statewide campaign, his first as a nominee.|1

Nearly 50 years after the publication of his classic best-selling novel, ""On The Road,"" the spirit of Kerouac, who died in 1969, is back in town at the new Beat Museum. In a modest one-room space sublet from the Live Worms art gallery on upper Grant Street, the museum uses letters, videos, books and photographs to tell the story of the writers known as the Beats."|1

When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher, only the deepest, most corrosive cynicism is possible. Trampling on the rights of others for political advantage was the modus operandi of Adelaide's Nomenclature Committee in 1837. Western Buddhism and Pentecostalism are sometimes criticised as self-indulgent forms of religion. Is Bishop Spong's Christian humanism any different? The press coverage of Iraq’s surprise victory in the Asian Cup final was — as Ernst Bloch might have put it — full of utopian sentiment. The win was, admittedly, a remarkable achievement, but one that hardly accounted for the sheer exuberance of the outpoured emotion that followed.|1
A syrah lover finds hope in the Northwest, but sticks to his guns about the failure of many to reach their potential. Several weeks back, I wrote a column about syrah, in which I asserted that this great if temperamental varietal has tremendous potential, but along its journey from grape to wine often gets lost, mugged or tired. You hope and hope and hope, too frequently arriving at disappointment. Syrah is like soccer: 90 loping minutes of play for a final score of 2-1. I love watching soccer, and I love following syrah.|1

WASHINGTON — House Democrats on Friday unveiled a comprehensive elections and ethics reform package that targets what they call a campaign finance system “rigged” for special interests. But while they argue the bill would strengthen the government ethics office and end “dark money,” the plan contains some major exceptions. “This bill is just the beginning,” said Rep. Donna Edwards (D-Md. ), who helped author the legislation. “This is a very important bill,” she added. “The way our campaign finance system works now is it favors the most wealthy among us and favors corporations….|0

Jill McGown, who has died aged 59 from cancer, was one of the generation of crime writers who shifted the genre firmly into the contemporary world.

Let’s dispense with the question of whether Democrat Ralph Northam is being treated unfairly. His grievous political wounds — by Monday, virtually all Democratic Party luminaries in the state and most Democratic presidential hopefuls had called on him to resign — are self-inflicted. When the photograph from Northam’s Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook surfaced Friday, his first reaction was to issue a statement of abject apology. Tactically, in terms of crisis management, that was the right move — own the transgression and say unambiguously that you’re sorry.|1

There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams's performances that could, roughly, be called his American and British sides. On the American side, there was the slushy tendency towards sentimentality, for which he became increasingly known, which, at its best, resulted in Dead Poets Society, The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire, and, at its worst, became Patch Adams and Old Dogs. Hollywood has long had a tendency to adopt the finest and most interesting comedians and then determinedly blunt the hard edges that make them interesting. Along with Richard Pryor, Williams was the most obvious example of that.|1

The only differences lie in two areas: the degree of each candidate’s willingness to use military force, and the speed at which they would proceed. Obama has consistently proven himself to be a more cautious politician and Romney’s own statements suggest that if he were elected, he would move more quickly to confront Russia and China.|0
PARIS -- France could become the latest country to ban the use of underweight fashion models . France 's health minister is studying a draft law that would make it an offence to employ models who are dangerously thin, the minister said Thursday. The draft law, drawn up by a group of doctors and sociologists, would target the fashion and cosmetics industries, which have been under fire around the world for promoting dangerous and unrealistic body standards. The draft law comes a month after Italian lawmakers approved a bill to outlaw underweight models on catwalk and in ads, following similar legislative moves in Israel, Brazil and Spain .|0

Cryptocurrencies, outside of Bitcoin, have failed to garner much attention from buyers, and while the same can be said of sellers, the digestion of losses over the past month is likely to lead to more losses soon. Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin are all carving out a similar bear-flag pattern that should lead to another purge of speculative excesses. Weak price action in ETH/USD has it set up to make another leg lower soon. It could continue to drift ever-so-slightly higher, but the developing bear-flag implies risk is skewed more heavily towards the downside.|1

The team that brought you driverless cars and Siri is now fighting a new kind of war on information. In the world of internet memes, Instagram filters, and Photoshop, seeing is no longer believing.

Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “Thank You” rally was the crowd’s silence when Trump mentioned that everyone should come together. The irony being that his campaign has been anything but unifying, which is why his supporters backed him. They’re tired of seeing this country’s demographics being changed, their white privilege being challenged. Unity and inclusion is far from what these people want — even after the election’s over. I left Cincinnati tired and disheveled, but perhaps mostly worried about our future.|1

Where will he wake up next? A prison cell? A tropical hammock? Or suspended on a cliff? It has the makings of a pretty good TV show, in the vein of Quantum Leap.

Some days he’s in prison, or squatting in a storage bin. Other mornings he wakes up in a goat pen or a tropical hammock.|1

And this year's Nindies Spring Showcase was no exception.

There was no shortage of activity taking place on the Grammy stage Sunday night – Motown tributes , Havana reproductions, and a 41-years-and-counting partnership between Stevie and Flea were all honored – but perhaps the most stunning part of the 60th Annual Grammy Awards came in the form of a surprise duet.

Toronto - A Porter Airlines Dash 8 with 54 on board encountered a UFO at a height of about 9,000ft and 120 knots indicated airspeed. The object was seen to move at incredible speeds and appeared to be changing colours from white to purple and back to white. At 500ft altitude the pilots shut down the autopilot and reduced the aircraft's speed by 10kts. It was noted the aircraft was not pressurised and was not fitted with a pressurisation system, therefore the aircrew could not explain why the aircraft was at 500ft. The UFO was no longer sighted.

The thorny question of abortion rights is again taking center stage on Beacon Hill and putting some top officials in the position of explaining and defending their own records on the controversial issue. Gov. Deval Patrick is calling on Republican presidential candidates to answer for past votes against federal funding for family planning services and abortion clinics and for opposing a Supreme Court nominee for her views on the issue. Patrick is also calling for the GOP candidates to explain their support for the state's 1996 buffer zone law.

"ANTIOCH 6/5/16 – When Trevor Dunning first entered the Trinity Christian School speech class, he was personally greeted, as each student was, and a few words of welcome were exchanged. He stood out with his solid physique, and soft intense face. However, the moment he spoke, his struggles became obvious. While talking, he would suddenly push out a breathy deep, ""UHH...UHH,"" which came every three of four words. It was a severe stutter problem. He had enrolled in my speech class to hopefully be able to speak better."|1
Running errands on your bicycle is a great way to burn calories and get some exercise. When you need something small or you are just checking prices and availability, pedaling to the store can be a pleasant experience if you can find a bicycle-friendly route. Several major shopping locations in the Rogue Valley can be accessed by bicycles without encountering excessive traffic. For example, both the Rogue Valley Mall and the Medford Shopping Center are easily accessible from the Bear Creek Greenway bicycle path. It is somewhat more difficult to ride a bike to the big-box stores along Highway 62 (Crater Lake Highway).|1

The Scimitar-horned Oryx no longer lives in the African desert. It is considered extinct in the wild. But this lovely-looking Ungulate hasn’t been completely wiped out because they can still be found at zoos around the world.

Add in birds, fish, reptiles and other living creatures, that number rises to nearly 1200.

Amazon.com's purchase of Austin-based Whole Foods Market is showing up in the wine category. As this year ends, Amazon has shut down Wine.Woot and its own wine marketplace in favor of Whole Foods' expansive wine operation. Now that Amazon owns Whole Foods, a licensed seller of wine, it comes under different state laws and can't sell directly from a producer. As a result, Dallas entrepreneur Matt Rutledge sees an opening in the marketplace. When Amazon.com purchased daily deals site Woot.com, based in Carrollton, in 2010 it also acquired Wine.Woot, a direct producer-to-consumer website that Amazon adopted for its own wine marketplace.|1

""We had something comparable in January 2014,"" said Aaron Reynolds, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Buffalo.

A new study for The New York Times reveals that the media pay for the top 200 CEOs is now $14.5 million. This is up 55 in the last year. While any one CEO may be well worth his/her raise, it is a growing political and PR problem for corporate America to be seen as rewarding those at the top, with little consideration for actual performance. For millions of Americans who are unemployed, under employed and being foreclosed on, it seems inconceivable that corporate CEOs can be getting significant raises at a time of such economic hardship.|1

Although state trademark registration offers fewer benefits than trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, state trademark registration can be a cheap alternative for securing limited trademark rights. Federal trademark registration can run anywhere from several hundred dollars to $3,000, depending on the type of mark being registered and the amount of attorney's fees. On the other hand, many states charge less than $100 to file a trademark application. Keep in mind that state registration will not offer multi-state protection, nationwide priority status, incontestability, a presumption of validity or the ability to file a trademark on an intent to use basis.|1

Doing business in British Columbia is particularly challenging because of the province ’ s reputation as a hotbed of environmental activism.

In such cases, there can be a considerable amount of “spin” from all quarters about the case and the government’s win.|0

Millions of refugees have fled their homes in war-torn Syria since 2011 . President Barack Obama previously planned to resettle 10,000 over the next year. But following the massive terror attacks in Paris over the weekend where at least 129 died, many governors and legislators — mostly Republicans — have called for Obama to rethink the resettlement strategy. Delaware is one of at least nine states to openly welcome the idea of refugees, despite an avalanche of largely Republican governors opposing. According to a count by Vox , 25 governors have said they would bar admission of Syrian refugees to their states and 15 governors said they still support resettlement in their states.|1
Beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl is never easy. When they scored 21 points the first three times they held the ball in the second half and took a 33-32 lead, we all thought the same scary movie we’ve seen since 2001 was replaying before our eyes. But this epic brought a different ending. This one saw Foles, a man of faith who wants to be a pastor when he leaves the game, play as if touched by God. He completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.|1

Planting the Savannah grasses in front of Cary Home seemed like a good idea in 2013 , when they received a grant from Duke Energy to do just that. The grant helped cover the costs of the plants and the labor to install them.

While the SP-BSP-RLD alliance may disrupt the caste math in many pockets , the Congress is relegated to the role of a minor challenger in these polls. It will now be interesting to see how the voter calculus will shift in UP in the run up to the next round of crucial state polls which are expected in September. However, this does not bode well for Modi who is the first Prime Minister since Indira Gandhi in 1980 to face an electoral defeat. He should also know that unlike Indira, he cannot come back to power through emergency decree .|0
Why Did This Woman Walk Away From Earning $600,000? It takes a lot of courage to quit your job and start a venture of your own.

If you live along the Eastern Seaboard and wake up early Friday you could be treated to a colorful sky hours before sunrise lights up the horizon. The Terrier-Improved Malumute sounding rocket is scheduled for launch Friday between 4:26 a.m. and 4:41 a.m. ET. Sounding rockets, by the way, have been used for over 40 years to carry science payloads on brief, 5-20 minute missions to space.

Labour leader Ed Miliband doesn't have an image problem, he has a policy problem. The problem is he doesn't have any, or at least policies that answer the gravity of the situation. Millions of people suffer as inflation outstrips wages. The cost of food, transport, fuel and housing skyrocket. A million people have visited food banks. This is not only a joyless recovery, for the vast majority of people it's a moneyless one. A smirking George Osborne may don a hi-vis jacket and march through building sites in Northern England to boast of recovery.|1

"The hyperloop train is leaving the station – and the UK must be on it | City A.M.
Steve Norris is former Conservative transport minister. Britain can reasonably claim to have invented the railway. Stephenson’s Rocket represented the pinnacle of British industrial-era innovation. The ability to move products and people by steam locomotion had a transformative effect on society. British ingenuity saw railways knit communities together across the country, and eventually the globe. And for the next couple of centuries, little changed. The same techniques are being used to maintain track now that were used in Stephenson’s time."|1
"The proposal that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to stem migration is nothing but 'hipster ' colonialism . Last week, in a speech that would have been unimaginable a few years ago, US president Donald Trump suggested foreign governments could solve the 'problem' of mass African migration to Europe by providing their citizens with financial incentives to return home.

AMD's Ryzen CPUs offer some of the best bang for the buck, but which is best? AMD knocked it out of the park with the first and second generations of its Ryzen CPUs built upon the Zen and Zen+ architecture. It certainly helped wash away the taste of its less-than-stellar Bulldozer chips that launched in 2011. Ryzen provides far better per-core performance, power efficiency, and support for more modern technology. But that makes it harder than ever to decide which one to buy. The Ryzen family is broken into four distinct branches, targeting the entry-level, mainstream, performance, and high-end enthusiast sectors of the market.|1
Eighteen years ago Monday, on June 24, 1995, South Africa’s Springbok rugby team staged a stunning upset to win the Rugby World Cup against the heavily favored New Zealand. But the game was much more than just one day’s win. This was the day Nelson Mandela cemented himself as leader of all South Africans. Elected the year before, democracy was still fragile and the racial divide was still raw. Rugby was an all-white game and Springbok captain Francois Pienaar was its hero.

"The decision on 15 December 2005 in the case of Jones v Garnett was a victory for the taxpayer and is a reminder to HMRC to get the correct valuation. The case centred on a claim for 45% VAT input tax on the cost of providing accommodation and meals for staff working in remote locations. The Tribunal had to decide if the costs were input tax recoverable. Mr Garnett provided the accommodation and meals and claimed the VAT back. HMRC decided to disallow the VAT claim as the provision of meals was not ""wholly and exclusively for the purpose of your business"" and was therefore not input tax recoverable."|0
Many Alberta small-business owners, who have been struggling through a prolonged economic downturn, are hoping the next provincial government will bring relief through business-friendly policies.

Over the past two years, small-business confidence in Alberta has reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the country, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which has been tracking the measure for about 20 years.|1

My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors. For example, consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron, or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one.

Now the south wall is a shrine to one of the best post players to come out of the area in years. Two-year starter and four-year contributor to the Rams basketball program, Tracy Smith, has his #16 retired to honor his time and accomplishments. Tracy played basketball through grade school and junior high. He started playing high school basketball as a freshman and never left the game.|0
Where do we begin to try to describe this restaurant? Probably the best place is first to apologize for keeping this secret to ourselves for such a long time.

"The European Commission is considering legal action against EU member states to protect farm animals from suffering in hot weather while waiting at the Bulgarian-Turkish border. This can be concluded from the commission's response to an EUobserver access to documents request, which asked for recent correspondence between the commission and EU capitals about the transport of animals to Turkey. ""The documents requested are letters exchanged with member states in the context of an ongoing administrative investigation on the implementation of regulation (EC) No 1/2005,"" said the commission's directorate-general for health and food safety in a letter to EUobserver."|1

Is a roving, body-scanning van a needed surveillance tool or a another step toward eroding personal privacy? Andy Greenberg of Forbes is reporting that American Science & Engineering, which provides x-ray scanners to governments and defense companies, has introduced a van capable of scanning nearby cars. The Z Backscatter Vans, or ZBVs, are used to scan for explosives, drugs and people, making them an ideal tool for security, law enforcement and border control agencies. The vans work by emitting low-level x-rays off and through nearby objects to collect a visual snapshot of other vehicles.|1
"SHAH ALAM ( THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK ) - The High Court in Shah Alam has rejected a bid to nullify the Federal Territories Election Commission (ERF), paving the way for its re-election later this month. Fourteen opposition lawmakers filed suit to declare the commission an ""illegal and unconstitutional"" entity, with two of its five members not appointed lawfully by the King, the court heard. Lawyer A. Manoharan told reporters that the commission should not have been constituted and that no decision could have been made without its chairman and deputy chairman."|0
The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has proposed to ask some insurance companies to mandatorily list on exchanges based on the number of years they have been in business. In a discussion paper on listing of Indian insurance firms, Irdai said it would direct general insurers (including health and reinsurers) to take steps to get listed after they complete eight years of operations. This will also apply to all life insurers that have completed 10 years. Irdai said firms that have already exceeded these criteria must list within three years from the date when the guidelines are issued.|1
In 1890, a group of eight large New York City bakeries combined to form the New York Biscuit Company and built a giant six-story factory in West Chelsea. Eight years later, they merged with their competitor, Chicago's American Biscuit and Manufacturing to form an even larger conglomerate – the National Biscuit Company, but the factory and headquarters remained in Chelsea. In 1901, the National Biscuit Company put their abbreviated company name on a box of wafers for the first time – Nabisco. Soon, Nabisco became the company's official name.|1

One 15-year-old girl from Russia loved sharing her image on social media . She would take selfies whenever the mood would strike her, and then post the pictures on Snapchat , VK, and other social media sites. These photos would make their way to the Internet, where they could be seen by thousands of people. The problem was that many of these photos had her full face visible, as well as other private areas, such as her nipples or vagina. The girl did not feel like she was violated by this because the images weren’t for a pornographic use.|0
MANSEHRA, Nov 27: Provincial Minister for Haj and Auqaf Nimroz Khan on Tuesday said time was not far when Torghar would be fully developed district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “People of Torghar remained deprived of basic civic amenities when their area was part of the Mansehra district and they had to travel to other parts of Hazara for meeting needs, but now the health, education and other infrastructure is being set up in the new district which would bring a major change in the life of people,” said Mr Khan while speaking at a public gathering in Nusratkhail, after inaugurating a road project in the area.|1
For three turbulent centuries, the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into the hearts of medieval Europeans. Indeed, the Viking Age, from A.D. 800-1100, was the age of the sleek, speedy longship. Without this crucial advance in ship technology, the Vikings would never have become a dominant force in medieval warfare, politics, and trade. With their invention of the longship, the Vikings spurred a literal sea change in medieval European affairs. The drekar, or dragon-headed longships, were stealthy troop-carriers.|1
Media & Entertainment I write about women in the business of Hollywood . New research released today from the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media showed that 65 percent of kids say they see more media with men in the lead than women . That’s an improvement over 2006, which found that 63 percent of young children saw more men. But the 65 percent stat is still a concern, said Dr. Stacy L.

Minister for Enterprise and Commerce , Max Bradford , today rejected claims by the Engineers Union that jobs created by a $100 million package of road-building and other works announced earlier this month would disappear in a few years. Mr Bradford said the package would create 740 jobs in a wide range of construction, road-building, road-making, earthmoving and maintenance activities, as well as 230 jobs in the road transport industry. The Engineers Union had questioned the economic viability of the programme, saying 300 of the jobs would last no more than three years, while the remaining 440 would last only a maximum of 10 years.|0

The University of Arkansas at Fort Smith recently told student Jennifer Braly that she was prohibited from giving lectures about the Holocaust because “it doesn’t serve a greater good for the community.” Braly was preparing to give the lectures in the school’s Jewish studies class when it was canceled by the History department chair, who wrote, “It would not be appropriate for the UA Fort Smith Department of History to host a lecture series about the Holocaust. This is not because we do not find it an important event in human history, it is that the lecture series does not serve a greater good for the community.|0
Promises to replace houses sold off under the Right to Buy scheme look increasingly hollow as the Government slashes council housing budgets by 60 per cent since 2010. The housing minister Brandon Lewis told a housing conference this weekend that the government had provided local authorities with the resources needed to build 130,000 new council homes by 2020 – which works out to building about 3,600 homes a year over six years. In 2013-14, local authorities built just 1,152 new council homes – less than half of that target, and just a fraction of what they built over the previous 15 years.|0

The Brexit crowd refused to believe the experts in the run-up to the referendum vote. The warnings from every leading economic body, including the Bank of England, were dismissed as scaremongering that should be ignored. Now, apparently, the words of the Governor of the Bank of England and other economists are so influential they can talk us into a recession – I am baffled by this double-think. But we need not agonise over all the talk now, because the facts are mounting up. Last week, we reported exclusive figures showing a sharp fall in the number of shoppers out on our high streets.|1

Where do we begin to try to describe this restaurant ? Probably the best place is first to apologize for the language of the previous review, which was translated from German, and it’s quite possible that the description does not reflect what we wanted to express.

Tim Hortons and an association representing some of its frustrated franchisees are close to reaching a settlement in two class-action lawsuits, the company announced Wednesday. Ontario franchisees have been fighting Tim Hortons on several legal fronts since June 2015. They claim that the company is abusing its dominance in the quick service breakfast food market by requiring franchisees to adhere to strict terms in the franchise agreements. The agreements require the companies to pay hefty royalties, which many believe are unreasonable, according to a statement from the franchisees. The agreements also require restaurants to use Tim Hortons products like coffee, buns and other food.|0

The feud between California and the Trump administration grows as the president visits the California-Mexico border to inspect wall prototypes.

However, according to the LA Times, the artist’s family attribute the painter’s death to natural causes, but this will be determined by the coroner.|1
Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of flaws in the way universal credit is designed, campaigners say. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG ) said arbitrary rules built in to the way universal credit is calculated leave some families unable to predict how much they will be paid each month, leaving households in debt and unable to budget. It can lead to claimants being wrongly benefit-capped – a penalty designed to “incentivise” jobless or low-earning households by severely limiting their benefits – because the system fails to spot they are working and earning enough.|1

Fish oil. Protein shakes. Vitamin D pills. The packages look alike. Does it matter which you buy?

What it finds might intrigue you. Vitamin C degrades in water, for example, so any water-based Vitamin C tablets are basically worthless. More than a quarter of fish oil products are rancid on the shelves, even when their expiration date may be two years out.|1

Last week, we learned that the Obama administration is considering other alternatives to stop foreclosures. Today, we have some color on what one of these efforts might look like. It would encourage servicers to reduce struggling borrowers' mortgage balance. Although banks have fought such efforts in the past, it seems that the program could benefit everyone involved. And the best part: it wouldn't take any taxpayer dollars. Of the residential mortgage-backed securities outstanding, about $1.3 trillion are so-called private label notes that were issued by banks and other financial institutions, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.|1

So, what’s next after all of the early NBA free agency buzz? Nothing like what’s happened so far, one would think. Unless Kawhi Leonard gets dealt, we’re waiting on a bunch of restricted free agents and whether or not they will stay put or sign offer sheets elsewhere. That list includes Houston’s Clint Capela, one of the premier centres in the league who surely will stick in Texas, Chicago’s Zach LaVine, who was one of the key pieces in last years Jimmy Butler trade, Boston guard Marcus Smart, Portland centre Jusuf Nurkic and former No.|1

Women who work in the White House do earn equal pay . Another right-made-up fact . The Republicans with their right-winged, anti-woman, anti-family, anti-child, anti-working man, anti-poor people agenda can go to hell . Today I was talking with my mom and my sister and one of the subjects was abortion. I think it’s time I write down my opinion on abortion because I can see that there is a big controversy around that subject. So here it goes, my opinion. I am against abortion.

Boulder has sued the fossil fuel companies. Probably 15 percent or so of us would be alive today without fossil fuels since without them we would be living in the Middle Ages without medicines, electricity, real sanitation, etc. Those of us who did not die in childbirth or by an infection caused by a scratch could enjoy living a short life behind an animal pulling a wooden plow. Maybe it would be best if we recognize that fossil fuels had their role, evolve our power supplies to renewable, storable resources, and stop demonizing everyone.|1

An extra $190,000 in state special education reimbursement funding that came in late last month has helped the town pay off its nearly half million-dollar settlement with the district's bus drivers union, officials said this week. Together with around $300,000 in savings found in the district's fiscal 2011 budget, the money has covered the town's $497,000 obligation to the drivers, whose jobs have been outsourced to a private busing company. The additional special education money, part of the state's circuit breaker program, will prevent the town from having to carry the debt over into fiscal 2012, officials said.|1
JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar: for more than two decades, women have been making a monthly pilgrimage to pray at one of Judaism’s holiest sites in a manner traditionally preserved for men, and the police have stopped them in the name of maintaining public order. But after a flurry of arrests this fall that set off an international outcry, the women arrived for December’s service to find a new protocol ordered by the ultra-Orthodox rabbi who controls the site.|1

The Giants have several holes to fill heading into the 2019 season , and own the No . 6 overall pick in next week’s draft.

In order to get an idea of what the Giants will do with the draft picks and free agency, let’s check in with The Huddle’s mock draft expert Peter Schwartz.|0
An online portal aimed at ensuring that the Muslim community gets religious knowledge from recognised sources was launched yesterday by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis).

The site, targeted at young adults, was unveiled by Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim at the Al-Iman Mosque in Bukit Panjang. Asked if LearnIslam.sg was created to counter websites which may have radical messages, Dr Yaacob said this would narrow the potential of the site.|1
"Apparently, beating Hue Jackson on the field wasn't enough for Baker Mayfield. Mayfield said, per Cleveland.com's Mary Kay Cabot. A day after throwing four touchdown passes in a 35-20 win over Cincinnati and then rejecting a postgame hug from his former coach, Mayfield called Jackson ""fake"" as the Browns rookie quarterback fended off criticism of his behavior. He was hired earlier this month as an assistant by Cincinnati. Mayfield is showing the athleticism and accuracy that made the Browns gamble on him in the draft instead of going with Sam Darnold, Josh Allen or Josh Rosen."|1
