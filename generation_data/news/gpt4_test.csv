"Veteran congressman Jim Leach (R-IA) went down to defeat in the massacre of 2006. I'm no apologist for ""moderate Republicans"" but it is worth saying that Leach was, in my estimation, fairly clearly the best House Republican. Nevertheless, one can only be thrilled with his defeat. That it happened just goes to show how fundamentally rotten the whole GOP scene had become. Leach was, in many ways, a person possessed of genuinely decent instincts and some fundamentally sound ideas about how the United States should conduct itself in the world. Nevertheless, in practice he was useless."|1

Want to end the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the act has metastasized into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has done much to shape the freedom of political debate in the modern U.S. What began as a vague statute that gave President Woodrow Wilson power to jail critics and censor the news media during World War I has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by policing secrets, not speech. Censorship did not end when the war did. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute.|1

Nobody asked me , but … if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization , subscribe to racist publications , post hateful content on social media, or attend far-right rallies, chances are, you're supporting and perpetuating racism and discrimination. Society must unite against these extremist beliefs that divide us and foster a sense of inequality among individuals. Governments, corporations, and institutions should collaborate in spreading awareness, reinforcing anti-discrimination laws, and combating misinformation, thus promoting tolerance and empathy across the globe. Additionally, individuals should work towards cultivating an inclusive community, rejecting and dismantling the ideologies of racial supremacy and racial divisions.|0
The carrier operates 744 mainline planes that vary in size, carrying 50 to 366 passengers each. For a typical 737 plane carrying 179 passengers, the reduction would mean about 11 pounds per flight. Per the paper, stopping on-board sales of duty-free items like “perfumes, chocolates and liquor” also saved 1.4 millions of gallons of fuel annually, saving United Airlines $2.3 million. Presumably that also means United was making less than $2.3 million selling the items in-flight or calculated that allowing passengers to pick them up at ground level would not dent its revenue significantly.|1

It's been more than a decade since Eminem's one and only starring role in 8 Mile, and you would be fair to assume his acting career had begun and ended right there.

Less than two years ago, I was seated at a South Atlantic League baseball game (low A ball) between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers — Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were charting the game. As I discussed in this post, neither pitcher seemed destined to make the major leagues. Richards had been undrafted in 2015 coming out of a small college, and thus had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016 and he was pitching well for Greensboro.|1

Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners on at least $10,000 over ten years compared to a BMW.|1

The Bible teaches, “Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are led by various lusts (see 1 Tim.3:5-6).

One person has said, “It takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it.” This is a true saying! I believe one of the most important reasons leaders fall is that most have never intentionally set up mental and emotional firewalls.|1

Multi-rotor aircraft are typically more stable and easy to fly, but also much slower than wing drones that focus on forward acceleration. Conversely, winged drones can fly faster and further than their hovering counterparts, but are harder to pilot, since they can’t perform vertical takeoffs and landings.|1

Arsene Wenger believes the return to fitness of England forward Theo Walcott and imminent recovery of Germany international Lukas Podolski will greatly boost his Arsenal squad's scoring potential.

January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are making progress is because factions with responsibilities for large chunks of the population are willing to compromise if that will help stem the accelerating decline in living standards nationwide. Economic activity is shrinking and shortages increasing because of the factional fighting and especially because two governments claim to rule the entire country. Then there is all the Islamic terrorist violence. While most Libyans appreciate the help from Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Kaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become more of a menace than the Kaddafi era secret police ever were.|1

Recently a patient of mine was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well documented, but he adamantly denied that anyone had warned him to avoid alcohol. An initial confession of “a few drinks” turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact.|1

Michael Hoeppner had to shed his Manhattan street manners. We realized we were paying an arm and a leg in Manhattan. We looked all over. We got into this area, and the homes are stunning, and it just seemed nicer. The people who sold us this house live next door, Rodney and Desmond. They already had a couple of offers. I think partly what happened is that they wanted us as neighbors: a pregnant couple trying to get a first-time home buy. I’m sure probably that was more appealing than .1 percent more on the down payment or whatever."|1

The response to the bombs by the crowd at the finish line was, I think, exemplary. Sure, many people fled from the explosions, and reasonably so. But a remarkable number ran, as they say, to the sound of the guns, even though when two bombs go off, one might well expect more. Many of these were professionals. The finish line of a marathon is a fortuitous spot to bomb, in that doctors, policemen, ambulances and so on are stationed there. Some soldiers happened to be on hand.

It was a Saturday morning. August. I remember it vividly. I was online, sat up in bed, browsing, not looking for anything in particular. An article caught my eye: it was about the refugee crisis. Men, women and children were risking their lives to get to western Europe, and many were dying in the process. It was a story of endurance and terrible trauma. In response I expected compassion, a swell of fellow feeling. But my heart sank as I read the comments. There was so much cruelty.|1
