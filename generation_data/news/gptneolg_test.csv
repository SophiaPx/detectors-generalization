Is our efficient Tax Office killing this country? I’ve never seen a story where the Reserve Bank was urging the Government to give tax cuts. But that’s exactly what’s happening now, which partly explains why our economy is going off the boil. In fact, the implication from this historically unusual tale is that the Tax Commissioner, Chris Jordan and his team have been doing such a great job cracking down on excessive deductions claims, especially from business. Because of the productivity delivered via computer technology, the tax take for Government is surging.|1
US Consul General in Jeddah Ryan Gliha last week inaugurated the 2018 Gulfwest Food Expo at the Park Hyatt hotel.

The expo was held to showcase the best food in Saudi Arabia. “At this expo, we’re really trying to get a lot of the fresh produce from Saudi Arabia into Jeddah and other major Gulf cities.

WASHINGTON, March 1 - Coming off a year of record-setting $1 billion-plus natural disasters, representatives of leading insurance companies said today that costs to taxpayers and businesses from extreme weather will continue to soar because of climate change. The insurers joined Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) at a press conference to discuss the mounting financial impact of global warming. Both Vermont and Rhode Island last August felt the brunt of Tropical Storm Irene, one of the record 14 natural disasters in the United States last year that each caused more than $1 billion in damage.|1

"Guernsey voters are set to elect politicians from an entire island constituency, rather than by the current district system. More than half of voters backed the change in the island's first ever referendum, which saw a 45% turnout.

Brands should resist the temptation to take on a hot-button issue in the Super Bowl as a way to stand out on TV, but in this case they couldn’t. This year, they’ve had the opportunity to be front and center and it worked in spades. In the first commercial of the evening, they took a stance on social injustice and gender equality in a bold and positive way. I was fortunate enough to be able to sit down in front of an audience (that’s a lot of audience members!) so that I could experience the ad.|0
The entry below is by Katrine Øgaard Jensen, who is one of the founding editors of EuropeNow, a journal of political research, literature, and art at Columbia University. She previously served as editor in chief of the Columbia Journal and blog editor at Asymptote and Words Without Borders. Had Poe lived to read Alejandra Pizarnik, she would have given him nightmares. Revered by writers such as Octavio Paz, Roberto Bolaño, and César Aira—the latter calling her “the greatest, and the last” poet—Pizarnik is one of the most important contributors to twentieth-century Argentine poetry.|1
The likeliest of sources stepped up for the Boston Red Sox on Sunday. David Ortiz, never one to shy away from the big moment, jacked a three-run homer off Joba Chamberlain in the ninth inning to give the Red Sox a 5-3 win over the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. The victory snapped Boston’s five-game losing streak and stopped the club’s streak of seven consecutive series ending in sweeps. Ortiz’s heroics obviously put the Red Sox over the top. But there was much more to Sunday’s win, so let’s go over some notes from the nationally televised affair.|1
"With the economy beginning to stall , Ben Bernanke 's war on the nation 's savers rolls on . A year and a half after declaring the ""worst depression"" on record, America's central banker has not changed a single bit of the playbook. And we're only at the beginning of another round in this war on saving . Over the past few months , Ben Bernanke has delivered on the promise of a ""liquidity crisis "" in the markets. But now he may be on the verge of something even more ominous: He may be pushing the nation onto the edge of an actual debt-deflation cycle."|0
First, we looked at which major brands cost the most to maintain over the first 10 years of a car's life. We grouped all years of all models by brand to compute their average cost by brand. In order to estimate annual maintenance costs, we found the amount spent on every two oil changes (as oil changes are generally done every six months). German imports lead the list by a fair margin, which isn't too surprising. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners on at least $10,000 over ten years compared to a BMW.|1
The extraordinary mummified remains of a 50-year-old woman discovered in a fetal position is set to go on display at a museum in France. As reported in The Independent, the 1,000-year-old mummy was discovered in 2012 at the ancient Peruvian settlement of Pachacamac near Lima. French archaeologists, who found the mummy crouched in a fetal position, have been careful to preserve the integrity of the remains by keeping it in the same configuration as when it was discovered. The new exhibition at the Musee de Confluences in Lyon will explore various human representations of death in different ages and cultures from around the world.|1

The carrier operates 744 mainline planes that vary in size , carrying 50 to 366 passengers each . For a single passenger on most airlines, the experience is almost entirely predictable and boring. For a passenger with an itinerary, however, everything is new and different every time they board an A320, A321, A330, A340 or A350. The A320 is a true marvel: the biggest and most expensive wide-body plane in the world, with room for 653 passengers on a normal service, and up to 1,200 on an extra service.|0
Four-term Governor Terry Branstad officially begins his fifth term today . Branstad , a Republican , left office in January 2014 to become president of the National Governors Association. He was previously governor of Iowa, a Republican-dominated state, and the second-longest serving governor in the country behind Rick Perry. After his stint in Iowa, he returned to his former state and was elected governor again in 2010 as the first ever openly gay governor in the country. His first two terms as governor were marked by a battle with unions over public-sector cuts, with the unions ultimately prevailing.|0

To involve private sector in healthcare, what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to reach out to more people. The nation has a new health policy after 14 years. The long gap itself indicates the priority, or the lack thereof, accorded to a sector that is in need of some urgent attention and has deep linkages with the nation’s aspiration to grow faster and emerge as a strong economy in the global order. The new policy has proposed seven key shifts in organising healthcare services, among them a welcome change in primary care from selective to assured comprehensive care with linkages to referral hospitals.|1

November 17 , 2015 12:55 a.m. Michael Hoeppner had to shed his Manhattan street manners . We realized we were standing next to a very small person who was not happy. November 16 , 2015 9:04 a.m. When I was a kid and I would visit family on the East Coast, we always took a train back to New York City, where they'd take us to Times Square. And we'd take the train down to the Empire State Building , and we'd stand there as it went round and round. It was kind of like standing on a big wheel.|0
John Tory has his first real competition in the mayor’s race. Jennifer Keesmaat, the city’s former chief planner, registered Friday before the 2 p.m. deadline to run for mayor. Keesmat said that she made the decision so recently that she didn’t have time to alert her parents that she was running. “It was a very impromptu decision but one that comes deeply from my heart and passion for this city,” she said, when asked if she was joining the race because of Premier Doug Ford’s announcement that he was cutting the size of council to 25 members.|1
Amitabh Bachchan is not just a legend for his contribution in Hindi cinema but also his inclination towards social welfare is also legendary. The legend is well documented in his autobiography but his contribution in the world of medicine and philanthropy has never been better described. During his last year of school, he received a call that his elder brother Shatrughan was critically sick and was going to die. He went to visit him, and when he arrived on the scene, he took him to the hospital where his brother was undergoing treatment. The treatment, however, didn’t work out, and his brother died.|0

Witnesses said the fight began when a wedding guest tried to kick the back of the bride’s chair, leaving it in pieces.|0
Dundee has long been a city of rich character, great wealth and extreme poverty. If the new V&A can give it a transformational boost, it will be worth every penny. I declare an interest. I went to the embryonic Dundee University in the last year it was a college of St Andrews and, like many whose lives were touched by the city, I have retained a strong affection for place and people. Not everyone grew to love it. In these days, “clearing” sent hordes of last-minute placements to what they fondly anticipated as the cloistered life of Queen’s College, St Andrews.|1
"The Frenchwoman who received the world 's first partial face transplant showed off her new features to the public Monday, the first time that anyone has seen their new appearance after the surgery. The 25-year-old surgeon who performed the operation has been at it for almost eight years and had not revealed the new face to her family and friends until she went public with the results on Monday. Surgery went well as the patient says she now looks ""better than ever,"" but there was a hitch: she did not know how she would look after the surgery."|0
Each year, the palike and state authorities ensure that Bangaloreans are forewarned before Diwali about being safe.

At her weekly therapy sessions, Julie revealed her most uncomfortable secrets: depression, debt, childhood sexual abuse. Her psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital would then type a summary into Julie’s computerized medical record. With that, more than 200 pages of sensitive notes became available to any doctor who cared for her within the sprawling Partners HealthCare system. She discovered this only when one doctor later referenced the notes. Julie, a 43-year-old lawyer, was unnerved, then angry. “The details are really nobody’s business,” she said. But Partners disagrees.|1
Maureen Wildes argues it is time to find out the true impact of the Vietnam War on the veterans 'in our society. They don't know what they did in the war.' For veterans and their families of the Iraq war, there is little doubt this conflict will have an impact on their lives for years. But for a majority of the population the Iraq war has been a relatively minor issue. It is a debate that has been raging for 15 years. But with the passage of time, not only are the arguments less passionate, but the stakes have been raised.|0
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio isn ’ t visiting Israel until August . But that doesn ’ t mean that the city won ’ t be doing a lot of business there in the meantime. On Sunday, a day when the US and Israeli flags fly at half staff, there was an opening ceremony for the Israel-NYC Trade & Economic Growth Initiative, a new program that de Blasio announced on Monday. The idea, of course, is to create economic development opportunities for New Yorkers, Israelis and Israeli-Americans by linking the two communities’ efforts to attract business investments.|0
Margaret O’Brien, 69, moved from Canada to Wolverhampton in 1971, got married, had three children and worked for the local council for more than 25 years as a dinner lady, meals on wheels driver, lollipop lady and cleaner.

In 2015, she was told her disability payments had been suspended because she was an illegal immigrant. The letter informed her “of our intention to remove you from the UK to your country of nationality if you do not depart voluntarily.|1

Long flights can be rough on the body, so it’s not uncommon to see people walking around the plane to stretch their legs. However one woman took it even farther by performing a yoga flow in the middle of the aisle. Kate Kay, a yoga teacher who was traveling for training, was captured on a now viral video by another passenger, showing her performing leg stretches, camel pose and a forward fold. Dressed for the occasion in patterned yoga pants and wearing headphones, Kay seems unaffected by those around her as she goes through the moves.|1

"Girls Like Biology , Boys Like Physics ? We all have our stereotypes about which subjects appeal more to girls or boys. According to some studies, however, girls are more likely to be attracted to sciences, while boys prefer humanities. Why? It's a question worth thinking about. Here are some factors that may influence your interest in this topic:

The fact that there are lots of females working in tech and that it’s considered a “girl’s job.”

That there’s more female professors than male, which helps create a wider selection of career choices for women."|0

The second was bitten in the left foot by a different rattlesnake. The first victim was treated at a hospital and released. Rattlesnakes have long been recognized as some of the most dangerous snakes in California, with bites often resulting in complications and fatalities. Although both rattlesnake bites were considered serious, according to the coroner’s report released Tuesday , they were minor, with no lasting effects.|0
With the economy beginning to stall, Ben Bernanke's war on the nation's savers rolls on. A few of these funds even pay juicy double-digit yields — like the one my Permanent Wealth Investor subscribers have earned 20% on in two years. Dividend harvest funds: These funds buy shares in companies that are about to pay a dividend, and then sell the stock after the dividend is paid. By doing this, they can rotate through companies with different payment dates, and thereby achieve a high dividend payout. The problem is that shares generally trade lower after a dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend.|1

It was a situation which baffled many around the world, let alone the passengers on board the British Airways plane. Yesterday a British Airways passenger jet due to fly from London to Dusseldorf landed in Edinburgh by mistake after the incorrect flight plan was given to its pilots.

It is understood one possibility is that on its final flight on Sunday, the plane had flown to Edinburgh and back and so the same flight plan was repeated again on Monday morning.|1

Then there is all the Islamic terrorist violence. While most Libyans appreciate the help from Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Kaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become more of a menace than the Kaddafi era secret police ever were.|1

Edgar Wright has never made a bad movie. He’s never even made less than a very good movie, and so it makes sense that thus far in his career, Wright has shied away from straight-up sequels. However, that could possibly change with Baby Driver. When Shaun of the Dead was a massive hit, instead of capitalizing on that with a zombie follow-up, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost instead made a thematically connected trio of films—the Cornetto Trilogy—with the also excellent Hot Fuzz and The World’s End.|1

Drones come in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes these days, but generally speaking, most of them still fall within one of two categories. There are those of the multi-rotor variety (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc), and those of the winged variety. Both categories have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor aircraft are typically more stable and easy to fly, but also much slower than wing drones that focus on forward acceleration. Conversely, winged drones can fly faster and further than their hovering counterparts, but are harder to pilot, since they can’t perform vertical takeoffs and landings.|1

RICH KARLGAARD: You should look at 4 areas. One is financial regulations, which still makes it hard for small business to get loans. You have the health care regulations that you mentioned, Obamacare is adding cost burdens everywhere you look, behind every nook and cranny. You have environmental regulations, and that&apos;s a whole area killing small businesses, particularly where I live in California. California farmers are getting rooned at the expense of the protection of certain insects. Then you have labor regulations. Last year we saw the national labor relations board war against Boeing.|1
Property search reveals nothing about community expertise or stellar service. Mobile is now the preferred mode of interaction with the online world, regardless of objective or content.

Can you put a price on faith? That is the question churchgoers are asking as the tradition of tithing -- giving 10% of your income to the church -- is increasingly challenged. Opponents of tithing say it is a misreading of the Bible, a practice created by man, not God. They say they should be free to donate whatever amount they choose, and they are arguing with pastors, writing letters and quitting congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teaching and rejected what has been a favored form of fund raising for decades.|1

Nobody asked me, but … if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization, subscribe to racist publications, buy tickets to a Holocaust denial conference and have a Holocaust denial DVD in your video collection, then you're probably a neo-Nazi. That does not mean you are once and for all a neo-Nazi. You can have a change of heart and a change of mind, and come clean. If you want people to believe you are no longer a neo-Nazi, you have a lot of convincing to do. It takes a lot of work to shake the brown shirt.|1

Tech execs discuss the impact automation technologies are having on their organisations. For many organisations and their workers, technology automation is an opportunity and a threat. On one hand, using robotic process automation and other tools creates efficiencies by automating manual and repetitive tasks. On the other, it has the potential to make jobs redundant. Tech execs gathered at roundtable events in Sydney and Melbourne recently to discuss the impact automation technologies are having on their organisations. A key issue raised during the discussion was the challenge of ensuring governance policies and procedures are followed as ‘bots’ replace tasks carried out by humans across the business.|1

We've had the Summer Olympics and a US presidential election, which dominate headlines (and Facebook timelines!) every four years.

Michael Hoeppner had to shed his Manhattan street manners. We realized we were paying an arm and a leg in Manhattan. We looked all over. We got into this area, and the homes are stunning, and it just seemed nicer. The people who sold us this house live next door, Rodney and Desmond. They already had a couple of offers. I think partly what happened is that they wanted us as neighbors: a pregnant couple trying to get a first-time home buy. I’m sure probably that was more appealing than .1 percent more on the down payment or whatever."|1

First , we looked at which major brands cost the most to maintain over the first 10 years of a vehicle's service life. After all, maintenance costs can sometimes be the only way to make or break a company's value proposition. But, there are some important factors that determine a vehicle's overall service costs as well. The first is how many of the parts or components needed for the maintenance of that vehicle. If you've only got a few key items, or if they're all common parts, then the service cost for the entire vehicle is likely going to be less.|0

The carrier operates 744 mainline planes that vary in size, carrying 50 to 366 passengers each. For a typical 737 plane carrying 179 passengers, the reduction would mean about 11 pounds per flight. Per the paper, stopping on-board sales of duty-free items like “perfumes, chocolates and liquor” also saved 1.4 millions of gallons of fuel annually, saving United Airlines $2.3 million. Presumably that also means United was making less than $2.3 million selling the items in-flight or calculated that allowing passengers to pick them up at ground level would not dent its revenue significantly.|1

Stark County’s unemployment rate in August fell to 6.8 percent, the lowest it’s been since September 2008.

Oil exploration companies have moved in, followed by engineering and construction firms that provide different services. Manufacturing also has seen growth because of increased demand locally and nationwide for steel and drilling equipment.|1

But there was never anything quite like the 2016 election campaign, when a handful of Democratic House candidates became targets of a Russian influence operation that made thousands of pages of documents stolen by hackers from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington available to Florida reporters and bloggers.|1

The first time I heard these verses was in a small storefront church in Kiev , Ukraine . I remember thinking to myself that it was exactly the way God wanted us to speak the word and live. When I was in college I traveled to Russia to teach English to young adults and I spoke to them about the words of God. When we finished I had one young man raise his hand and begin to ask the question – what did God want from us today? The first time I heard these verses was the same way. As we spoke, I found myself agreeing with every word we spoke.|0

The M1917 light tank, for example, was merely a copy of the Renault FT-17. That kind of copycat engineering is an idea that would be unthinkable now.|1

Then he gave up three consecutive singles to load the bases. He had no runs to show, so the Mets went to their bullpen and threw out the last three batters for a 3-0 Mets win.|0

This, by the way, was the moment when I completely gave up on the convention.|1

"Veteran congressman Jim Leach (R-IA) went down to defeat in the massacre of 2006. I'm no apologist for ""moderate Republicans"" but it is worth saying that Leach was, in my estimation, fairly clearly the best House Republican.

Why’s an incendiary Dutch journalist on the payroll of the ex-Alaska governor’s political action committee? A Mother Jones investigation. In recent months, Sarah Palin’s political action committee, SarahPAC, has paid thousands of dollars to a mysterious company that’s gone to significant lengths to mask its ownership.

WASHINGTON - RFK Stadium, the once and future home of major league baseball in the nation's capital, doesn't yet look like a field of dreams. It's configured for soccer, not baseball. The field must be replaced, and the dugouts, locker rooms and press box need upgrades. On a rainy day last week, a quarter of the field was mud and tire tracks. It looked like Vince Lombardi should be coaching football here - which he once did for the Washington Redskins. But that was in 1969.|1
Brazil is currently implementing the Brasil Sem Miséria programme — a continuation of the successful Fome Zero— which aims to end malnutrition and to increase productive work days for children. Brazil’s success in improving nutrition and reducing its child mortality rate is largely attributable to the successful application of evidence-based and cost-effective actions. This includes the implementation of the World Food Programme’s Food Security Strategy in 2011–2015, the expansion and strengthening of rural and primary health-care services, which has led to the reduction of stunting in schoolchildren and the reduction in the number of child deaths from malnutrition.|0

"Young African-Americans embrace computers as integral to their futures , but they may be missing out on key opportunities to access technology.

In other words, it's almost as if black people just don't need their cell phones, and if they need them they just don't use them often enough."|0

Repeat drunk driving offenders could soon face harsher penalties for their actions. New Jersey law now limits punishment for affected offenders to a traffic offense. Bail typically is set at $2,500. The traffic offense designation allows drivers charged with drunken driving to continue to drive while awaiting their court date. Awaiting consideration on the Assembly floor is a bill to end that practice. Instead, A3057 would boost punishment for a person convicted of driving under the influence two times or more within 60 days to a fourth-degree crime.|1
"Not only did former BP chief executive Tony Hayward go sailing on his yacht at the height of the oil-spill mess, but he took his own boat with him, a source told me.

The Internet has changed beyond anything could have foreseen just five years ago. It is no longer a browsing medium: it is full of Web 2.0 applications, real time communications challenges and a whole range of threats that are designed to piggy back on this new usage. As a result, Web security has changed immeasurably - it's no longer enough to block, stop or inhibit IP sessions. Web filtering cannot hope to meet the security challenge. This Webinar will explain how Internet usage has changed and how your perception of IT may not match what your users are actually doing, resulting in your security controls being by-passed.|1

UNITED NATIONS, August 26 -- Amid an increasing drumbeat of media coverage predicting US missile strikes on Syria, regardless of what the UN chemical weapons investigation team finds in the suburbs of Damascus, a question has arisen whether the strikes would take place with the UN team still in the country. Q: In regards to Syria, Britain and the US officials have suggested that an investigation at this point might be without result because Damascus has had time to cover up some of the evidence. What does the UN hope to find from this investigation? What actions would the UN be willing to take?|1

[ Written by Jonathan Starling ] It is not unusual to read and hear complaints about the amount of trash that ends up in the gutter of New York City’s streets. But it is particularly striking that a lot of trash is tossed out by the people of New York City. The amount and type of trash that a city throws out each day is not random. The amount of trash that is thrown out each day has a strong correlation with the level of poverty of the New York City neighborhoods in which it is being thrown out.|0

""We may have to take a step back in order to be more consistent at the back,” he said. “It’s something I don’t want to do, to play more counterattacking, but I’m giving it serious thought."|1
Syria: Why is Assad Advancing? In the Presidential elections held at the beginning of June, Assad was declared the winner with 88.7% of the vote. That is not surprising considering the nature of the regime. However, in spite of the fact that these were in no way “free” elections, and that many people could not vote as they were in refugee camps beyond the borders of the country, what emerged was that a significant section of the population is backing Assad. Why is this? Stop criminal attack on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli army embarked on a ground offensive into Gaza.|1
Could drain tubes solve Compact conflict? How do we get more water into the Republican River? Could it be as simple as redesigning existing pasture dams to have drain down tubes installed?

Note: This solution does not remove any of the pasture dams, as they provide a valuable service for us, it only redesigns them. The tubes can be set an elevation that allows water to remain for livestock, wildlife, its.|1
BlackBerry has decided not to renew T-Mobile 's license to sell its products . A promotion that went awry last month resulted in the demise of T-Mobile 's plans to sell the BlackBerry phone.

Part two of Naomi Klein's report on the events that triggered a momentous new kind of politics in Argentina. Up until quite recently, Argentina pursued a policy of official amnesia when it came to the crimes of the Dirty War. Sure, the human rights non-governmental organisations still issued numerous scathing reports, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo still marched and the children of disappeared parents still showed up, from time to time, outside the homes of ex-military figures to throw red paint. But before the Argentinazo, most middle-class Argentinians regarded such actions as macabre rituals from a bygone era.|1

The best element of M. Night Shyamalan 's 2017 horror film , Split - and one of the few things that he did right by giving it an interesting premise - is the way he makes us care for both characters. It is a rare thing to find an actor that can convincingly transform a character into someone that we can root for, even as they are torn between their desires. But we know that it won't be a simple task for Night to bring us to root for the lead character in his next project, and we can expect him to prove to be quite the trickster in the process.|0
The Bible teaches, “Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are led by various lusts (see 1 Tim.3:5-6). Many great people in God have fallen into fleshly temptations and potentially ruined their lives and ministries. One person has said, “It takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it.” This is a true saying! I believe one of the most important reasons leaders fall is that most have never intentionally set up mental and emotional firewalls.|1

Does the ‘perfect’ bourbon exist? In fact, for about 20 years, the distillery has undertaken Project Holy Grail: its systematic, clinical quest for a “perfect” whiskey. By its own account, it is close. Will this happen in late April? We can’t know for sure, since it’s all super hush-hush. Last summer in New Orleans, Mark Brown, the president of the Sazerac Co., which owns Buffalo Trace, gave a presentation on Project Holy Grail to a group of journalists.|1
This past June, the Tacoma Rainiers brought reindeer mascot Rhubarb and local icon “Epic Sax Gorilla” up onto the roof of Cheney Stadium, where the Triple-A club plays, for a routine crowd-pleasing stunt. Also up on the roof was Tacoma News Tribune columnist Matt Driscoll, who recently explained how roof dancing earned both his employer and the ball club thousands of dollars in fines from Washington’s Department of Labor and Industries. But buried somewhere in the pile of public documents I eventually obtained, a single email — from a single individual — helped provide a fuller answer.|1
A new poll reveals that more Americans would choose the Internet as their only news source than TV, radio and newspapers combined, and Internet reports are considered much more reliable that other media. It also shows only 1 in 200 people surveyed believes newspapers will be a dominant source of information in 2014.

A search for ‘ toxic mold ’ will result in hundreds of scary warnings and ‘ studies , ’ but the problem may be larger than anyone thinks. The truth is that mold exposure is the #1 killer of babies born at home , yet there is no national standard for safe mold testing. The lack of testing makes it hard to know who is at risk, and how to reduce exposure. The CDC’s current advice is to look for ‘ warning signs that may indicate the presence of mold ’ on your baby’s skin,’ but this may be a dangerous approach.|0

Professionals gearing up for Olathe’s public firework display on Tuesday are taking extensive safety precautions and following many regulations that many families forget about in backyard displays. Fireworks caused about 11,100 injuries nationwide in 2016, with children younger than 15 accounting for 31 percent of those injuries, according to the U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission. In 2015, the office of the Kansas State Fire Marshall counted 137 firework-related injuries. The year before, nearly 40 percent of firework injuries harmed children 12 or younger. Municipality policies vary in Kansas and Missouri.|1
Anyone who’s ever been frustrated at the task of shooting video in low light should be poised to freak out over Canon’s weird and amazing new camera. It’s a video camera that shoots full HD color footage in almost complete darkness. The ‘multi-purpose’ camera, dubbed only MH20F-SH, has a full-frame sensor with 2.26 megapixels. The reason for the meager resolution is because each pixel is very large—19 microns to be exact. That’s 7.5x larger than, say, the pixels found on a flagship DSLR like the Canon 1Dx.|1

The tide is turning at Frankston , with the Dolphins scoring successive victories for the first time in almost six years this weekend. In the first period, it looked like the Dolphins were heading for a familiar end-to-end battle against the Brisbane Broncos, but a strong comeback from their opponents saw the home team come out ahead in a game that saw the Broncos come back with a late try and a late field goal. With a scoreline of 18-4, it was the Dolphins who controlled the game for the first quarter of the match as they put pressure on their opponents and held a 13-3 lead after the first quarter.|0

As a veteran of the movement to combat climate change , I have been conditioned to expect disappointment . So far, we’ve seen disappointing news about global carbon emissions, disappointing news about coal , disappointment about renewables and disappointments at the international level. Still, this disappointment is not about global warming; it is about climate politics . It is not about policy . The policy debate is a sideshow, while the real problem is politics and politics is a sideshow. And it’s not a sideshow that will be resolved by climate change policy either, so the disappointment is not about the policy debate.|0

When George Orwell wrote â€œ1984â€ he included a vision of the future in which people would converse in a language called. Orwell described Newspeak as “the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year”. Orwellâ€™s idea with Newspeak was to have a world where all shades of meaning were removed from language, which reinforced the total dominance of the State. Calling something one thing when itâ€™s the exact opposite also might be an example of Orwellian Newspeak, like calling a bill full of spending on liberal social programs an economic stimulus plan.|1
The data center market in Russia continues to grow. One needs to look only at the considerable increase in commissioned facilities to find evidence of this. Consumers are no longer impressed by data centers spanning several thousand square meters, containing 1000 or more racks—these have become de rigeur. According to data provided by Datacenter Dynamics, for the last two years the Russian data-center market is ahead of India, China and Brazil in terms of total investment. Similarly, based on recent construction data from the same period, Russia places second only to Brazil from BRICS nations in terms of total area.|1

This clears the way for debt agencies to charge higher fees on overdue loans . According to a Tuesday analysis by The Associated Press , state and federal debt-collection agencies have been raising their fees over the past year, a trend that will only increase as the number of people in default grows.

The agencies will be able to collect more money from more people.|0
New Zealand’s Abortion Supervisory Committee is appealing a High Court judge’s decision that said there is reason to doubt the legality of many abortions in the country. A registered practitioner may legally perform an abortion in New Zealand only if acting under a certificate approved by two consultants, who are appointed by the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The appeal also argues that the Court made a legal error in concluding that the committee can form its own opinion about the lawfulness of consultants’ decisions to grant or to refuse approval for an abortion.|1

Up and down the East Coast voters braved very cold weather in the pre-dawn darkness as they queued up to register to vote early for Tuesday’s midterm congressional elections. Some waited in the cold for as long as two hours. It’s just another example of what some are calling “the polar vortex,” the cold air and low air pressure that’s causing the polar vortex phenomenon this week. There’s no consensus as to what’s triggering the polar vortex phenomenon, but what seems to have been the most significant contributor is what’s happening in the Atlantic Ocean off of New England.|0

As a veteran of the movement to combat climate change, I have been conditioned to expect disappointment. So when, as administration coordinator for Fossil Free Stanford, I was called into the office of the senior assistant to the Stanford University president in early May, I approached the meeting with apprehension. There were good reasons for my concern. That very morning, Harvard had arrested a student demanding an open dialogue on fossil fuel divestment. Last fall, Brown University flatly refused student calls to sever ties with thirteen of the dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policies at a national and international level had fared no better.|1

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but also for that reason, an extraordinary case study for evaluating the mandate that should determine the relationship between the National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation. Ideally speaking, the national security set up anchored on Intelligence, exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security –external or internal –with the aim of neutralising it in time. At the same time, however, it does this on the authority of the elected Political Executive that is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy.|1

Property search reveals nothing about community expertise or stellar service . Mobile is now the preferred mode of interaction with our communities as a result of the iPhone and its ability to bring a new level of personalization.

The response to the bombs by the crowd at the finish line was, I think, exemplary. Sure, many people fled from the explosions, and reasonably so. But a remarkable number ran, as they say, to the sound of the guns, even though when two bombs go off, one might well expect more. Many of these were professionals. The finish line of a marathon is a fortuitous spot to bomb, in that doctors, policemen, ambulances and so on are stationed there. Some soldiers happened to be on hand. But others were not professionals.|1
Keen to kickstart pension reforms , the finance ministry has asked the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA ) to set up a panel to explore the possibility of setting up a new state-run pension fund to replace India’s Public Provident Fund (PPF) — a move that will likely trigger a big fight within the ruling Congress party.

The panel, which will be headed by finance secretary Anushka Sharma, could submit its report to the prime minister in about three weeks.|0
The life of the mind puzzles poets and neuroscientists who go about mapping it and labeling it , and , finally, naming it. There are many definitions for mind, many definitions of “human being,” and many of the definitions of “person” that we have come to accept. But they are, ultimately, definitions. They mean the same thing. What is mind and what is person depends on what you’re asking the question and how you define it. All definitions in any given language have the same limits.|0

It isn ’ t uncommon for a facility manager to lead a meeting, to participate in training sessions or be involved in any of a wide variety of different projects and activities that will help the facility achieve its organizational objectives. This is true, of course, in the corporate environment and it is just as true when managing a public facility as it is when a private facility. If you are interested in this career, then you will need to become proficient in all of the many different areas that are related to facility management.|0

Neither Chambers nor the firm elaborated on the reason for the sudden corporate exit. Shares of Weight Watchers fell more than 7 percent in after-hours trading yesterday following the announcement. The stock has since retreated.|1

Multiple bills at the New Jersey statehouse are of interest to truckers and others using roadways throughout the state . In the wake of New Jersey's largest school shooting, legislators are working to pass new gun restrictions and other gun-related bills that could result in a delay of the implementation of new security measures for schools. The new proposals would require background checks of all people seeking to buy guns at gun shows, sales at licensed gun dealers and at the state’s online firearms auction site (NRA). The current law doesn’t require this at all.|0

Manatees are large, gray aquatic mammals. They have fat bodies — I believe that “husky” is how clothing companies would attempt to get manatees to buy big jeans — that taper to a flat, paddle-shaped tail. Average adult manatees are about 10 feet long and weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds. Manatees are among God’s ugliest creatures in the ocean, and there are a lot of strange-looking seagoing creatures. Those are facts — well, the ugly observation is an opinion, but it’s obvious enough to be fact — that I learned from the Save the Manatee Club website.|1

Montana, Exxon-Mobil At Odds Over Oil Spill Montana and oil giant Exxon-Mobil are at odds over an oil spill in the state's Yellowstone River. Exxon-Mobil says it's doing all it can to clean up the spill and has promised to see the cleanup through. That's not enough for Montana's state officials — particularly its governor. They say that the company hasn't been forthright on the extent of the spill and that they're not doing enough. Michele Norris speaks with Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer about those accusations — and the steps the state is taking to rectify them.|1
"""Of all the German surface warships, the British feared Bismarck the most. Her size, speed, and firepower made her a definite threat to Allied shipping in the Atlantic, and it was imperative that she be neutralized."" In July 2001, the wreck of the Hood was found 9,334 feet below the surface of the Denmark Straight. She lies in three sections with the bow on its side, the mid section upside down, and the stern speared into the seabed. In 2013, the wreck was more fully explored with a remote-control vehicle."|1
Nobody can predict with accuracy when stock markets will end their record-setting bull run . But the best way for investors to prepare for the worst-case outcome is by buying stocks on the dip. That means buying stocks when they are cheap or even free. It also means avoiding stocks you don’t know enough about. But don’t do any of this blindly—it’s important that you know what you are getting yourself into. After all, we don’t know what the worst-case outcome will be like when there are no stocks in sight, and we might not even know when it will happen.|0

Millennials are not a homogenous group of individuals, so a one-size-fits-all marcomms approach won't work. Millennials want healthy food and are willing to spend more on it. Oh wait, no – Millennials are in debt and want healthy food at affordable prices. They are also self-entitled. But they’re creative and tech-savvy, so that’s a good thing. And don’t try traditional advertising with them, stick to social media. If all of this sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a small glimpse of the countless contradicting reports on Millennials.|1

Without a doubt, the addiction drama “Beautiful Boy” – not the slasher-flick “Halloween” – is the most terrifying movie opening at the multiplex this weekend. Starring Steve Carell (“Foxcatcher”) and Timothee Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name”), the movie is a chilling and unsettling look at a young man’s plunge into meth addiction (and heroin, pills, pot, etc.) and a devoted father’s efforts to save him. It’s a true and horrifying story so powerful that an uninspired director and clichéd script can’t dilute its impact.|1

Led Zeppelin stole from the ‘60s group Spirit? And did “The Voice” steal from “American Idol”? A recent court case has the estate of the composer of “Taurus” claiming “Stairway To Heaven” is in violation of copyright laws. Creatives have been borrowing from each other for centuries. But what constitutes actual harm -- business, artistic, or otherwise? How much of the original art moved to the new effort? This is always the blurry part. Lawsuits over music copyright have been going on for more than a century.|1
Ken Block makes amazing gymkhana videos. But NSW Police didn't want Ken Block to make this particular gymkhana video — the one you see right up there — in Sydney. So the Hoonigan team went to New York instead, leaving Australia in its dust. Here's the video they made — the video that could have featured the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and all our most famous city's iconic landmarks. Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was filmed to coincide with the launch of Forza Horizon 3, set in Australia — so it made sense for Gymkhana Nine to be filmed in Australia.|1
Brazil is currently implementing the Brasil Sem Miséria programme — a continuation of the successful Fome Zero— which aims to do just that, Marques Porto says. Initiated in 2003 by former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Fome Zero is credited with having taken 30 to 40 million Brazilians out of poverty. One of the core actions of the programme was providing poor children with free school lunches, which were purchased by the state from family farms. In this way, support to local small farmers was provided at the same time as offering quality nutrition to children from low-income families.|1

The Israeli ambassador and almost all staff have been evacuated from the country’s embassy in the Jordanian capital, Amman, amid growing fears of an assault on the mission similar to last week’s attack in Egypt. Fears of violent anti-Israel protests similar to those that erupted in Cairo were sparked following calls for a “million-man march” outside Israel’s embassy in Amman. The action, scheduled for Thursday, had been organized via Facebook. The motto, “No Zionist embassy on Jordanian territory” was published online earlier this week and has already attracted thousands of pledges to attend the demonstration.|1

Study suggests complex behaviors were handed down for tens of thousands of years. Despite intense scientific inquiry, there are still major gaps in our knowledge about early human life. One major question that remains unanswered: when humans were first capable of complex cognition? In other words, when did early humans develop sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as prioritization and cultural transmission, that we would recognize today? A new study in Nature addresses this; after six years of excavation, archaeologists have unearthed technologically-advanced stone tools that were created about 71,000 years ago.|1
If this was supposed to be a measuring stick game for the Flyers, they came up a bit short. Coming off a 12-1-1 dash since Jan. 12, the Flyers skated squarely into a wall named the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday night and it was a reality check. The team with the best record (46-11-4) in the NHL easily skated past the Flyers on the way to a 5-2 win at the Wells Fargo Center, sweeping the season series. With Pittsburgh winning at New Jersey, the Flyers fell back to eight points out of a playoff spot again.|1

Where were you when you received your 40 Under 40 award ? It was 2009 and I was in my first year as a reporter for NPR. I had never heard anything like this from a public radio station before, and I remember thinking, well, that’s probably an honor that I never would have received, or I’m so far behind the curve, and it’s really too bad that I am not in some of the fields that they are celebrating. So, I wrote a letter of acceptance and had a nice little package that I was supposed to give to the producer.|0

Bono, on the other hand, had removed himself to a quiet back room, where he was keeping company with a plump, middle-aged white guy in a suit and tie. (Bono was wearing a T-shirt and a fuzzy sweater whose sleeve needed mending.) This was Randall Tobias, head of the Bush administration's AIDS program. The administration had just announced that the program was providing antiretroviral drugs to 155,000 Africans with AIDS.|1

For small businesses that sell on credit, accounts receivable can make up a substantial portion of the balance sheet. During the annual audit, auditors will check to see if your claims regarding the accounts receivable balance can be proved. These claims are known as assertions. The most common audit procedure related to accounts receivable is confirmation, in which the auditor will ask your customers to confirm their account balance. Knowing which assertions can be proved by confirmation can help you understand why your auditor asks for multiple audit procedures on the same account. Accounts receivable confirmations mainly serve to prove the existence assertion.|1

I recall the wood-paneled walls of the room where I sat in the back, slightly embarrassed by the evangelical enthusiasm of my fellow expats.

As a result, small distilleries are facing more competition and less time to research, develop and produce their product.

The life of the mind puzzles poets and neuroscientists who go about mapping it and labeling it, and, in my case, trying to find it.

The best element of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film, Split - and one of the few things it did right - happened at the very end. The brief, surprising reveal of Bruce Willis reprising his David Dunn character from Unbreakable created a shared universe that Shyamalan was all-too-eager to exploit. Unfortunately, there's a wide gulf between teasing fans with a momentary appearance and building a story around it. Glass, the third film in what has become a trilogy, comes across as a mix of half-formed ideas baked into an uneven casserole.|1

Rep. Francis D. Gibson speaks on the Utah Inland Port Authority Bill that he sponsored as Utah Legislators gather at the capitol to discuss legislation during a news conference, Tuesday, Dec. 3, 2013, in Logan.

"DALLAS - Like many Americans, Martin Jacobson was overjoyed that Navy SEALs had captured and killed Osama bin Laden.

[Written by Jonathan Starling] It is not unusual to read and hear complaints about the amount of trash talk that the two main parties indulge, a phenomenon which seems to be magnified during election campaigns. And yet, seldom do these two parties actively seek to engage in real trash talk. And by that, I mean talking about trash in the literal sense! And yet the issue of trash and waste in general is one that affects us all, touching on matters of public health, social cohesion and tourism, amongst others!|1

Less than two years ago, I was seated at a South Atlantic League baseball game (low A ball) between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers — Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were charting the game. As I discussed in this post, neither pitcher seemed destined to make the major leagues. Richards had been undrafted in 2015 coming out of a small college, and thus had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016 and he was pitching well for Greensboro.|1
"The main task of North Korea's junior minister for re-information is to refute everything ever said by French intellectuals. One year he did a special on Jean-Paul Sartre and began with Sartre's assertion that ""Three o'clock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do"". As it was a drowsy Friday afternoon, the junior minister simply made a quick call and renamed his local football team 4.25 Sports Club. This made Sartre look very silly indeed, because the club play all their matches at 4.25pm. In fact every time they play, their fans chant ""Are you watching, Jean-Paul Sartre?"""|1

January 29 , 2015 : Follow the money . One reason the new peace talks are making progress is because the US wants to show its support for Israel. But don't be fooled. It's not sincere. The Israeli public doesn't want peace with the Palestinians. Polls reveal that a great majority of Israelis (more than 70% in many cases) reject the idea. In a survey last week by Israel's Channel 10, only 14% of Israelis said they believed that a two-state solution would solve the problem. So why is US president Barack Obama insisting on it?|0

"Bob Cannard shovels compost which orignally came from San Francisco food scraps at Green String Farms outside Petaluma , Calif.

Food scraps

The idea of the compost pile began with an idea to put food scraps into the ground to make a living soil where all life can survive. That’s how compost piles work, where organic waste decomposes into humus which is rich in organic nutrients, minerals and micro-organisms. But it takes time for them to do their job. For most food scraps to go into compost, they must come from organic material which has not been sprayed, doused, treated with pesticides or genetically altered."|0

They didn't make the playoffs and that was a major disappointment, not that it should be. They finished the year better than expected.

An initial confession of “a few drinks” turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact.|1

"SANTA MARIA, Brazil – Penny-pinching by a band known for its onstage pyrotechnic displays may have cost more than 230 people their lives at a nightclub in southern Brazil, according to a state police inspector leading the investigation into this weekend&apos;s deadly blaze. Inspector Marcelo Arigony told reporters at a news conference Tuesday that members of the band knowingly purchased flares meant for outdoor use because they cost a mere $1.25 a piece, compared with the $35 price tag for an indoor flare. ""The flare lit was for outdoor use only, and the people who lit them know that,"" said Arigony."|1

It 's hard to underestimate the success and increasing power of Amazon . Their market cap hovers just under $100 billion, and has a current market cap of $89.4 billion. The company was founded in 1994 , but didn't have any sales until 2002. At that point, their sales surpassed $10 billion dollars, which put them above Barnes & Noble , a company that is now only slightly larger. Amazon is a company built on sales, which means you can't really argue that they aren 't successful, either.|0

Ballinhassig 4-17 Castlelyons 1-12: A polished second-half performance powered Ballinhassig to a comprehensive win over Castlelyons in the Cork Premier IHC quarter-final on Saturday evening. Inspired by Danny O’Callaghan and backboned by five members of the Cork intermediate team, the Carrigdhoun side displayed many of the attributes that may see them make a swift return to senior ranks. While the forwards will grab the headlines, it was the performance of O’Callaghan and the solidity of the Blues’ half backline that launched their second-half offensive and a return of 2-11 (2-10 from play) on the scoreboard.|1
It was another quarter of rapid growth for the optical-equipment maker, but shares fell as investors were uninspired by the revenue forecast. Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN) reported its first-quarter results on April 27 after the market closed. While the results came in a bit ahead of its own guidance, traders were selling off shares in Thursday's trading as the company projected that growth is going to slow in the coming quarter. At 3:40 p.m., shares were down nearly 24% from the previous close. Let's dig into the results to see how the company performed in the three areas that I suggested investors should pay attention to.|1
What exactly separates people from machines ? Two things , actually : creativity and empathy . No matter what gets you to the top, you can always find someone or some thing to beat you. And no matter if you reach the very top, you have to share the same goal of success with the very next guy or girl. It doesn't matter if you're born with it , or it's acquired at an age of 18 , it's still there. It's the only thing that counts. And the only thing on which we have to prove is that it works.|0

Thr best place to start the mortgage process is to get preapproved by a lender. An important step to buying a home is getting a mortgage. For a first-time buyer, the process can be intimidating, but the best place to start the mortgage process is to get preapproved by a lender. Here are some tips on the process. A preapproval (or prequalification) letter is a document from a lender stating that they are tentatively willing to lend you up to a specific amount of money. Different lenders use the terms prequalification and preapproval differently.|1

"Dublin : Lawmakers overwhelmingly voted on Friday to back Ireland 's first bill on abortion , legalising the practice in cases where a woman's life is at risk. The bill aims to establish a new category of ""competent and responsible"" consent - something which is not legally recognised by Ireland's current laws but which would be legalised here. The Bill will be voted on by the Irish Parliament on Monday when it is likely to pass with a margin of around 90 votes. Ireland will become the second country in the world, after Iceland in 2014, to legalise abortion."|0
According to data provided in the World Economic Forumâ€™s Global Enabling Trade Report 2012, the countryâ€™s macroeconomic fundamentals are strong, making it attractive to at least a fraction of the foreign investors concerned over the Euro crisis. The countryâ€™s biggest investment opportunities are in manufacturing, real estate, agriculture, mining, infrastructure, retail, and tourism â€“ areas of investment that are largely untapped given the quantity of FDI seeking attractive international opportunities. Manufacturing is especially attractive to Japanese and Korean firms. Retail is booming, given the rise in domestic consumption.|1
It was a situation which baffled many around the world , let alone the passengers on board the British Airways flight to Heathrow on January 9th. The pilot of British Airways flight BA 072 had been instructed by the pilot of the plane being diverted to the West Midlands airport. The captain and first officer then had a discussion about the need to abort the flight to avoid the threat of a bomb on the plane. But it seemed that the flight path had been changed and the captain could not see the need to abort, so instead of taking off the flight to London was diverted to Manchester.|0
A budget crisis facing the Palestinian government is deepening in the wake of last week 's election victory by the Hamas movement, analysts say. They warn that there is now the potential for a crisis over the financial and economic crisis engulfing the PA government and its main backers, who include the US and the European Union. Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced last month that he would seek a general election in April, which was widely interpreted as the first step to end his three-year unity government with Hamas, which has controlled the government since 2006.|0
Guess what? The NBA really is a showbiz affair. Only super-producer David Stern isn’t pulling all the behind-the-curtain strings (otherwise, New York somehow would have won the draft lottery). To the contrary, the league lurches along in the manner of an over-budget, out-of-control Hollywood spectacular — propelled by the ego of big-money players, rife with jaw-dropping plot twists, subject to endless rewrites. And to think: We haven’t even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers. Regrettably, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball.|1
I have just been reminded of why I quit financial journalism after 11 years in the saddle, including a spell as a Wall Street correspondent. While the world of finance had its fascinations, I grew increasingly disillusioned by the dominant narrative that it was always about the money, rather than any other considerations such as values and social impacts. They never registered on the radar. That's not altogether surprising, given the testosterone-fuelled dealing rooms and the fact there is very little connection between the decisions of City executives and their impact on ordinary peoples' lives.|1

If the U.S. presidential election were resolved on social media , Barack Obama would be the clear winner this year. It's easy to see why: he has the largest social-media audience in the world, the most influential Twitter feed and, of late, a Twitter account that regularly features more than 100,000 followers. His most vocal supporters are also among his biggest fans. And if Obama is so popular on Twitter, why has he never used it to call for a protest like his chief rival, Mitt Romney, on the eve of the presidential campaign?|0

A communications professor at Texas A & M University wanted to find out about the effects of changes to the way that science was done when he went to college.

So they created an experimental assignment involving a group of students in science class. They assigned half of them to complete a study about evolution, while the other half to do something completely different: they were to create and write a science paper.|0

Mickey Boodaei has been a leading entrepreneur in the security space for years. He co-founded Imperva, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2011, and he co-founded Trusteer, which was sold to IBM for $1 billion in 2013. Soon after the latter acquisition, he founded Transmit Security. Interestingly, Boodaei did so without seeking venture capital.

Dublin: Lawmakers overwhelmingly voted on Friday to back Ireland's first bill on abortion, legalising the practice in exceptional cases where doctors deem the woman's life at risk from her pregnancy, as the predominantly Catholic country took its first legislative step away from an outright ban. Exhausted legislators applauded Friday's 127-31 vote, while outside the parliament gates abortion rights activists cheered as they watched the result on their smartphones. It capped a grueling debate that locked lawmakers in argument from Wednesday morning to 5am Thursday and, after a pause for sleep, through midnight Friday.|1

Want to end the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the act has metastasized into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has done much to shape the freedom of political debate in the modern U.S. What began as a vague statute that gave President Woodrow Wilson power to jail critics and censor the news media during World War I has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by policing secrets, not speech. Censorship did not end when the war did. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute.|1

For so many reasons, the United States delegation must choose the latter option. A few sections of the proposed agreement are provided below, each of which would require the federal government to unconstitutionally infringe upon the right of Americans to keep and bear arms as protected by the Second Amendment.|1

In 1980, a group of non-commissioned officers (NCOs) overthrew the elected government despite intense resistance from a badly outgunned police force, which was only subdued when the navy shelled them into submission. This led to the establishment of a de facto military dictatorship (though there was a nominal civilian president) in the country for the next seven years, headed by Sergeant-Major (self-promoted to Lt.

The two-year-old case will now move to the merits, where it is likely to go to the Supreme Court.|0
VIDEO : On March 30 , 2017 , Atlanta drivers on I-85 north found themselves in a stunning situation when the left lane suddenly became part of the right lane of traffic without any warning.
