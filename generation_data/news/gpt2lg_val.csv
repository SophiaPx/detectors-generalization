MANSEHRA, Nov 27: Provincial Minister for Haj and Auqaf Nimroz Khan on Tuesday said time was not far when Torghar would be fully developed district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “People of Torghar remained deprived of basic civic amenities when their area was part of the Mansehra district and they had to travel to other parts of Hazara for meeting needs, but now the health, education and other infrastructure is being set up in the new district which would bring a major change in the life of people,” said Mr Khan while speaking at a public gathering in Nusratkhail, after inaugurating a road project in the area.|1
Gotham is dealing a familiar Joker in Season 2. Seemingly confirming what the Fox drama’s showrunner Bruno Heller shared with TVLine, Season 1 guest star Cameron Monaghan (Shameless) posted to Instagram a “police lineup” picture of him back in jocular Jerome mode.

PARIS -- France could become the latest country to ban the use of underweight fashion models. France's health minister says she supports a proposal that would criminalize advertising that features anorexic models. The measure would put France, a world capital of fashion, in alignment with countries like Israel and Spain that are cracking down on the glorification of dangerously thin models. Socialist lawmaker Olivier Veran, who is also a doctor, wants to add language to an upcoming health bill to make it illegal to employ models deemed to have an eating disorder.|1
The storm we're bracing for is the type of January variety everyone prepares for : monitor school closings, snowfall in some areas, high winds, blizzards or heavy rains. NOVEMBER 11--An Indiana police officer accused of sexually assaulting a drunken 16-year-old student pleaded not guilty Friday morning to a felony charge that would bring him upstate to stand trial. Officer Eric Williams, 24, was arraigned in Franklin County District Court after pleading not guilty at his previous hearing. Williams has been charged with sexual battery (a second-degree felony). At the previous hearing, Williams was denied bond because he posed a flight risk.|0
"Firefighters more progressive in how we're using information to gear how we make our decisions within the community. TEMPE, AZ — When you think of essential firefighting tools, an iPad may not be top of mind. Now, more than ever, first responders are using those devices to collect a plethora of information, in real time, during an emergency. When Tempe firefighter and paramedic Nelson Goossens is not treating patients during a call, he is likely inputting information. A lot of it.

ORANGEBURG, S.C. — Talk-show host and media mogul Oprah Winfrey has conducted a jailhouse interview with a South Carolina mother who pleaded guilty to killing her two sons. Winfrey went to the jail in Orangeburg last week where 30-year-old Shaquan Duley is awaiting sentencing. Winfrey interviewed Duley’s family in September 2010, a month after Duley suffocated her 2-year-old and 18-month-old sons, then tried to stage their deaths by driving her car into a river. Prosecutors say she killed the children after being badgered by her mother about being a poor parent. Duley faces 30 years to life in prison when she’s sentenced Friday.|1
For Bruce Logan, microbes are an electrifying subject. The Kappe professor of environmental engineering at Pennsylvania State University has spent years studying how plants use sunlight, water and minerals to thrive in the environment. After working on such studies, he wondered: What if bacteria could also use light and water as a source of energy? In a new report, Logan proposes that microbial life can harness the sun's energy to produce electricity.

Running errands on your bicycle is a great way to burn calories and get some exercise. When you need something small or you are just checking prices and availability, pedaling to the store can be a pleasant experience if you can find a bicycle-friendly route. Several major shopping locations in the Rogue Valley can be accessed by bicycles without encountering excessive traffic. For example, both the Rogue Valley Mall and the Medford Shopping Center are easily accessible from the Bear Creek Greenway bicycle path. It is somewhat more difficult to ride a bike to the big-box stores along Highway 62 (Crater Lake Highway).|1

The British are known for their collective stiff upper lip. The elements of British style translate easily in every situation, even if we're not the most outgoing people in the world.

The first image of Earth from lunar orbit. Before an Apollo-era NASA could launch a few humans on top of a rocket and plop them down on the moon, it needed to find safe places to land. So from 1966 through 1967, the space agency launched five spacecraft, which it creatively named Lunar Orbiters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Lunar Orbiter 1 was the first to swing around the moon. It automatically took film photos, processed and scanned them, then beamed the images back as radiowaves to receivers on Earth, where technicians recorded them onto analog data tapes.|1

WASHINGTON — House Democrats on Friday unveiled a comprehensive elections and ethics reform package that targets what they call a “culture of corruption in Washington” and aims to reduce the role of money in politics. The bill, among the first to be considered as Democrats take control of the House after eight years, would make it easier for citizens to register and vote, tighten election security and require presidents to disclose their tax returns. Dubbed the “For the People Act,” the legislation marks an effort by Democrats to set a tone of good government as they take the majority following historic gains in the midterm elections.|1

No doubt if you are into painting of the artistic kind then you will probably know that artist Thomas Kinkade was a huge influence on me, so I hope it wasn't any surprise when I started working on my first commission with him.

A FAKE doctor allegedly used useless metal rods to test people for cancer and diabetes then charged a fortune to cure them. Onelio Hipolit-Gonzalez, 73, also claimed the device could diagnose multiple sclerosis and vision problems. Hipolit-Gonzalez was arrested last week in Florida for practicing the sham procedures out of his friend's home. The procedure also involved taking a patient’s blood before re-injecting it back into their bodies.

OAKLAND — Nine people living in East Oakland discovered over the past nine months what it”s like to be a journalist — taking on the challenge of telling important but unheard stories from the community around them. Saturday, those nine budding journalists graduated from the Oakland Voices nonprofit program, which helped give them the tools to gather and report those stories. Oakland Voices is a project founded by Oakland Tribune senior community engagement editor Martin Reynolds and coordinated by veteran journalist Brenda Payton. By enlisting people from Oakland”s neighborhoods to tell Oakland stories, the project unravels tales of tragedy and triumph that are not covered by mainstream media.|1

I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad’s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should not constantly be called to account for the vicious behaviour of IS. Still less to be stigmatised until unnamed Muslim leaders disowned it. I was disconcerted to see so many Eureka Street readers appeared to agree with the demands against which she protested. Both Ruby’s complaint and the responses to it reminded me of the attitudes taken to Catholics in an earlier generation. The popular charges against Catholics were honed in the Great War and particularly by the referenda on Conscription.|1

The new law finishes old business in Trenton and expands the so-called Tuition Equality Act, which let qualified immigrants pay in-state tuition. Going to college is not cheap these days. In fact, for many in New Jersey, it is unaffordable. Gov. Phil Murphy’s signing into law a bill that allows undocumented immigrants to apply for state financial aid to help pay for college beginning this fall won’t help all who hope to attend a post-secondary school, but it could help many. With Murphy’s signing, New Jersey becomes the 10th state to extend financial aid to undocumented college students.|1
"You may remember Gary Coleman, the child actor from the 1970s show ""Diff'rent Strokes."" Coleman died on May 28, 2010, in Provo, Utah, from an intracranial hemorrhage. There is much that can be learned from Coleman's less-than-perfect estate plan. However, to understand where Coleman went wrong, some context is needed. Coleman, like many child actors, had a very sad and tragic life. After ""Diff'rent Strokes"" ended its successful eight year run, Coleman sued his parents for misappropriating millions of dollars in his trust fund."|1
Holwell Sports reached their first Senior County Cup final in 17 years on Tuesday evening after a penalty shoot-out win over Heather St Johns. John Webster’s side raced into an early two-goal lead but were left hanging on through 90 minutes and then extra time as Heather fought back to level. A nerveless and clinical display then won them the shoot-out 4-1 as Holwell booked their place in the final against Leicester Road on Tuesday, May 2. Assistant manager Andy Hill said: “I thought Heather were a very good footballing side, and it was a hard-fought win for us rather than a brilliant performance.|1
It's not your imagination—but you should blame the candidates, not the media.

Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit has ended its investigation into the death of a 43-year-old Rideau Lakes man who allegedly shot himself after receiving a phone call from police. The incident occurred on the afternoon of June 3, in the Township of Rideau Lakes, just west of Smiths Falls, when an Ontario Provincial Police officer contacted the man and told him he would be arrested. Shortly afterward, at 3:20 p.m., the man called 911 reporting that he had sustained a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police and paramedics responded to the call and the man was taken to Ottawa Civic Hospital by air ambulance.|1
When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher, only the deepest, most corrosive cynicism is possible. Trampling on the rights of others for political advantage was the modus operandi of Adelaide's Nomenclature Committee in 1837. Western Buddhism and Pentecostalism are sometimes criticised as self-indulgent forms of religion. Is Bishop Spong's Christian humanism any different? The press coverage of Iraq’s surprise victory in the Asian Cup final was — as Ernst Bloch might have put it — full of utopian sentiment. The win was, admittedly, a remarkable achievement, but one that hardly accounted for the sheer exuberance of the outpoured emotion that followed.|1
Who pulled the plug on the canal this time? It’s winter, and we’re certainly not in the middle of a drought, so what’s happened to this stretch of the Grand Union Canal? The Cooks Wharf area of the canal appears to have drained away again, just four months after the same section was left bereft of water. The area sits just outside Cheddington on the way to Marsworth. In August there was a similar scene after a boater left a lock gate paddle open – the gates control the flow of water in the lock.|1

For decades, aid groups have assumed they know what's best for refugees and the poor ; a growing number are questioning those assumptions. In 2015, for the first time, one-fifth of the world's refugee population was undernourished or malnourished. The World Food Program reported last week that children in Jordan and Syria were suffering from stunted growth, acute malnutrition and anaemia. According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), this year more than 3,600 Syrians crossed into Europe. At least 5,000 migrants have died crossing the sea to Europe since the beginning of the year alone.|0
Who pulled the plug on the canal this time? It ’ s winter, and we ’ re certainly looking for work in the city. There’s a rumor that the canal’s construction company has filed for bankruptcy due to bad financial results, which will make it tough for them to get money. That's why we have decided to scrap the canal completely, and put the water right back here. In the meantime, let us remind you that it’s snowing as much as it’s ever been. (There are still some places where it snowed just a few hours earlier.)|0
JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar: for more than two decades, women have been making a monthly pilgrimage to pray at one of Judaism’s holiest sites in a manner traditionally preserved for men, and the police have stopped them in the name of maintaining public order. But after a flurry of arrests this fall that set off an international outcry, the women arrived for December’s service to find a new protocol ordered by the ultra-Orthodox rabbi who controls the site.|1

"Before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married, the tabloids floated a strange rumour: the couple might elope. Would they run off to Jamaica? Hawaii? Toronto? Would they decamp to the Okavango Delta in Botswana, where the howls of exotic animals would greet a small gathering of family and friends as the young couple held hands before a vegan minister, swapping vows in the crackling glow of a union pyre as flames licked the sky and village elders blessed guests before the yoga-safari reception?

Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the importance of making them a place for the living to visit and remember, said Jeff Bickley, head of public affairs with the Department of Archaeology.

The team that brought you driverless cars and Siri is now fighting a new kind of war on information. In the world of internet memes, Instagram filters, and Photoshop, seeing is no longer believing. Everyone is a photographer or videographer once they have a smartphone in their hands, which often comes equipped with alteration tools already installed. But manipulations that started with cropping and teeth-whitening have spurred into the spread of misinformation. Parkland shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez is pictured ripping up a shooting range target, left.

The five-storied 'Farhad Mansion' resembles any other well-maintained house in an affluent neighbourhood of Chittagong city. Yet no gatekeeper guards any of the two steel gates that lead to the small front yard and the stairway of the building. With the summer holidays, it is not surprising that the ground and fourth floors that house an English medium school are deserted. But even the residential second and third floors show no signs of life. Climbing to the top, the locked grilled-gate to the roof is reached. Standing there, one cannot help but shudder, imagining what had happened there on April 27, 2012.|1

The battle over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s new “borrower education tool” unveiled earlier this week is heating up, with the National Association of Mortgage Bankers now joining the Mortgage Bankers Association in calling on the CFPB to take the “Rate Checker” online tool down. The CFPB’s new interactive page has come under fire because it mentions rates and costs without including disclosure items that TILA-RESPA rules mandate for borrowers – annual percentage rate, closing fees, etc. “This tool will do nothing but confuse consumers in their shopping experience,” said John Councilman, president of NAMB.|1

"BAMAKO, Mali – The head of an ethnic Dogon militia blamed for a massacre in central Mali is denying that his fighters were involved in the gruesome attack. Youssouf Toloba also dismissed the Malian president&apos;s vow to eliminate the group, because ""he isn&apos;t the one who created it."" Human Rights Watch has said that Toloba&apos;s ethnic militia known as Dan Na Ambassagou has been implicated in scores of attacks in recent months.

"John Bennett(July 20), a teacher at Westside Middle School, was upset by the School Board's decision to have teachers teach all sides of any controversy. He is right, of course, that pretending all sides of any controversy are equally valid is nonsense. But a good deal of the issue hinges on our definition of ""teaching"" a position. If ""teaching"" means that the teacher merely presents all sides of a controversy as though they were equal in weight and legitimacy, then we are being equal time indoctrinists."|1

One minute he was strutting around the end zone, staring into the stands, the look of a stone-cold killer. The next, he was looking at a game clock on the far side of the locker room.

Under Trump, presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor. Since discovering that the constitution gives him the somewhat controversial power to absolve criminals who are also his friends, Donald Trump has pardoned more people and commuted more sentences in his first 18 months in office than any of his three immediate predecessors. The pardoning spree continued on Tuesday, as Trump issued two more before jetting off to Europe to stomp all over NATO, this time clearing the names of father-son arsonist duo Dwight and Steven Hammond, Oregon cattle ranchers whose 2016 fight against the federal government became a conservative cause célèbre.|1

German scientists working on the Wendelstein 7-X fusion device started a series of experiments that could eventually prove the superiority of hydrogen for power generation. Researchers at the University of Hannover have set out to determine exactly how much fuel (hydrogen gas) can be burned in order to generate 100MW of power, with the goal of testing a hydrogen-fueled plant within 10 years. If this plan works, it would mean an explosion-free solution for the ever-dwindling supply of clean, renewable energy and may mark a new technological breakthrough in the drive to produce alternative sources of energy.|0

The “digital workforce” may sound like science fiction, conjuring up images of lines of robots running through an office. In truth, the digital workforce is a tangible reality. But, rather than teams of robots, it involves a more promising environment with people, automation, and artificial intelligence working side by side. This hybrid workforce is coming to life thanks to businesses that recognize the transformative potential in automation and AI. In a study by Genpact of 300 C-suite and senior executives, 79% of AI leaders – the companies generating impact from AI – expect their employees to be comfortable working alongside robots by 2020.|1

For decades, aid groups have assumed they know what's best for refugees and the poor; a growing body of evidence suggests they're wrong. Both academic research and practical experience, such as with the mass of Syrians fleeing civil war, shows that simply handing out traditional relief goods may not be the most effective way of helping the dispossessed. Aid agencies are tentatively also giving away cash and letting refugees decide for themselves what they need. While the results may be unexpected, the money is being wisely spent and rarely wasted - contrary to old prejudices among donors.|1
I have written previously about my own pets, and the most common prompt for me to do this has always been their emotional state. I don't think there are many pet owners that don't experience some sort of pain or discomfort with their pets at some point in their lives.

Could Washington state elect the greenest governor in the nation?

Considering all the comings and goings of people involved in the project, we should be grateful that Bohemian Rhapsody has finally landed on the big screen.

CBS President and CEO Les Moonves has pushed for rights to stream NFL games on the network's digital service. CBS Corp. said it obtained rights to carry National Football League games on its CBS All Access streaming service, allowing the most-watched U.S. TV network to offer its most popular programming online.

Financial terms weren’t disclosed. While NFL viewership has declined this year, football remains the most popular programming on TV.|1
Many Alberta small-business owners, who have been struggling through a prolonged economic downturn, are hoping the next provincial government will bring relief through business-friendly policies. The Alberta election is April 16 and polls suggest that Rachel Notley’s ruling New Democrats will be replaced with Jason Kenney’s United Conservatives, which have campaigned to scrap the carbon tax and loosen some labour rules that have driven up business costs. Over the past two years, small-business confidence in Alberta has reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the country, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which has been tracking the measure for about 20 years.|1
Millions of refugees have fled their homes in war-torn Syria since 2011. President Barack Obama previously planned to resettle about 10,000 Syrian refugees. But the United Nations estimates that more than 5 million people have died in the conflict, and millions more are internally displaced. It was unclear Wednesday whether Trump would move forward with that plan. TEL AVIV, Israel — In the wake of the shooting deaths of nine African-American worshipers in a Charleston, South Carolina, church on June 17, the Black Lives Matter movement has adopted a new name for itself: #BlackLivesMatter’s New Name.|0
Shimla, Jan 14 ( IANS ) It was a bright sunny day in Himachal Pradesh on Monday, with a temperature near 22 degrees Celsius, when some locals began gathering around a makeshift memorial of flowers. Many of those present came from the neighbouring district of Rakhine. But this wasn`t just a place of mourning, as they also wanted to draw attention to what they feel is an epidemic of sexual violence in the area. They have started a group called `Jungle Women', which claims that there are 10,000 female victims of such crimes in the State.|0
"Peter Brown took the precaution of carrying a parachute on his home-made plane but it wasn&apos;t enough to save him. Mr Brown, 57, was found dead inside the wreckage of his home-made ultralight after crashing in trees, metres from the Lovedale Store and Cafe in the Hunter Valley cafe yesterday. Hunter Valley Inspector Peter Vromans confirmed his parachute was onboard but it had not been deployed. ""That will be part of the investigations,"" he said.

ASTANA, Kazakhstan—Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s first and only president, resigned on Tuesday, ending his nearly 30-year reign and setting the stage for an opaque succession process in the oil-rich Central Asian country of 18 million people. As his speech hinted, Nazarbayev’s departure from office will not mean giving up the reins of power. The aging leader, who has led Kazakhstan since 1989, when it was still part of the Soviet Union, said that Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the speaker of the Senate and a trusted political ally of Nazarbayev, will take over as acting president until new elections are held in 2020.|1
"In a democracy, it is said, we get the government we deserve. The same can be said about politics in Canada, at least since this week. As I noted in an earlier article:
A lot of people don't think the Harper government has been particularly effective in the last few years. That's partly because he did some things that didn't actually make much of a difference, but partly because he and his Conservatives have consistently underestimated the public will to vote for policies that are unpopular, or simply out-of-date. It may not be time to say goodbye to Twitter."|0
Today marks the 314th anniversary of the last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. Geological records indicate that this 9.0 magnitude tremor occurred as the Pacific plate broke free from the subducting San Andreas fault. This seismic event caused the formation of two large, shallow tsunamis in the western Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Mexico, which were not recorded at the time. According to NOAA, one tsunami is estimated to have been as deep as 3,000 feet and the second as high as 12,500 feet. These tsunamis reached the west coast of North America before being pushed by ocean currents away from the continental United States.|0
Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “Thank You” rally was the crowd’s silence when Trump mentioned that everyone should come together. The irony being that his campaign has been anything but unifying, which is why his supporters backed him. They’re tired of seeing this country’s demographics being changed, their white privilege being challenged. Unity and inclusion is far from what these people want — even after the election’s over. I left Cincinnati tired and disheveled, but perhaps mostly worried about our future.|1

The analysis performed by the team’s members, some of whom acted as observers during 2013 local elections in Estonia, revealed that sophisticated attackers, like those employed by nation states, could easily compromise the integrity of the country’s Internet voting system and influence the election outcome, often without a trace. The team chose to analyze the Estonian system because Estonia has one of the highest rates of Internet voting participation in the world—over 21 percent of the total number of votes during the last local election were cast through the electronic voting system.|1

Briefly : Each time we get the chance to pass along a bit of info about Christopher Nolan ‘ s upcoming Batman trilogy, it's good to share that there will be multiple versions of this film. Not only have Warner Bros. been trying to push the franchise forward over the last few years with a number of different directors, they've also had their fingers crossed that director Christopher Nolan ‘s version of The Dark Knight Rises wouldn't be the end of things. Well, that hasn't worked out so well and the studio has announced that the project is now called ‘ Batman vs. Superman” instead.|0

House Republicans weren ’ t talking about the economy as they left Washington for the August recess before a challenging week ahead.

Plushenko’s glorious career was finished. He had hoped to cap it at home after a comeback from spinal surgery, which he did, partially, by helping Russia win the team competition. But his 31-year-old back, after all those years of wrenching revolutions and hard landings, gave out two nights too soon. In essence, Plushenko sacrificed his chance at another individual medal to put his country on top. He was a longshot for gold, but in a sport of sequins and stuffed animals, he brought pugnacious sizzle. He was the James Cagney of the ice.|1

My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors. For example, consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron, or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one. Each of these cells, (if taken from the same individual) has an identical genome — and yet each is “reading” a very distinct subset of that genome and consequently carrying out very different behaviors. The choice of what to read and what to hide away is made during development.|1

I ’ m still not convinced Foreman is the answer — they ’ d be crazy not to draft a guy like him. It’s also hard to imagine someone who plays in the AFC West taking him, especially after the Rams and 49ers made the playoffs last year. However, it sure sounds like San Diego is going to try and trade up to get him, which is why I feel comfortable drafting him as the third quarterback behind Carson Wentz and Jared Goff of the Eagles. There's no question about it: this kid will be a starter in the league for years to come.|0
Doing business in British Columbia is particularly challenging because of the province ’ s reputation as a hotbed of environmentalism. Many industries are protected under legislation designed to protect aquatic life, and local regulations are often less restrictive than those in other parts of North America or Europe, which has made it more difficult for foreign companies to establish operations. This has created a situation in which there are very few Canadian companies that can be counted on for reliable water quality data. In order to compete successfully in the world’s biggest marketplace, however, Canadians need to look beyond their own borders and build good relationships with global suppliers.|0

The water stored in the snowpacks of San Juan, Grand and eastern Uintah counties was 207% above normal as of Thursday, and was 191% above normal for southwestern Utah, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service.|1
A mother forges her son's signature on a letter of intent. A newly committed Georgia player hoists a flag as teammates cheer and high fives. And one of those players is a former college football star with the same name. There was an all-white school that didn't get in. Now there's a white school with all-black students and a black quarterback, at least for one year. ‪I’m not sure if I’d want to be married to him. He’ll be my best man, I’ll have a lot of responsibility, and then we can go on our way.|0
The U.S. government is charging that Google is systematically paying women less than their male counterparts. Testifying in a San Francisco court Friday, Department of Labor (DOL) regional director Janette Wipper said the government “found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” according to a report in The Guardian. The charges come as part of a lawsuit the DOL filed against Google in January, seeking access to the company’s compensation data and related personnel records. As a federal contractor, Google is required to permit the government to inspect records relevant to its compliance with equal opportunity laws.|1
"One of the biggest highlights of Valve's Greenlight process for games awaiting their arrival on Steam, is that it provides a platform where players can vote for games, and see what other people think. A few days ago I was fortunate enough to win myself one of Valve's Greenlight titles — The Swapper. As a gamer, I have always had an appreciation for open-world design, and The Swapper is at the top of my ""must play"" list in terms of concept and presentation. Unfortunately, due to my lack of knowledge of Java programming, it didn't work quite as smoothly as I might have liked."|0
A local nonprofit whose mission is to transform the lives of at-risk youths will host its sixth annual fiesta fundraiser, featuring live entertainment, a dance party and more than 30 food trucks. DETROIT -- The Detroit Pistons are ready to put it all on the line. It's been a rough season so far for the franchise, and they have a tough stretch in the next month as they travel to Miami, Boston, Cleveland, Oklahoma City and Phoenix. Coach Stan Van Gundy believes his team still has room to get better and wants to do something special to give them the chance to prove that point.|0
ANAHEIM, Calif. / Oct. 26, 2000—Stephen F. Bollenbach, president and chief executive officer of Hilton Hotels Corp. (NYSE:HOLT), will assume the position of chairman emeritus, effective Feb. 1. I don't know why some people choose a career as a singer-songwriter. There are many things to like about being a performer, but for some, it's all in the name. I have been a professional musician since I was 6 years old. My parents were divorced when I was two, and I started learning how to play piano when I was 12.|0
This week, in a closed-door meeting of Congressional Democrats with President Obama, Representative Ed Perlmutter of Colorado bluntly told the president that lawmakers would not let him and his administration backtrack on climate change. In a move that will impact the lives of millions of people worldwide, the United Nations launched a new initiative to help vulnerable people in developing nations who experience extreme heat, drought or famine. The new programme aims to provide protection against extreme weather and other natural catastrophes to as many as 3 million children under the age of five every day for one year from 2018 to 2022.|0
American troops may have finally left Iraq, but for that nation's citizens the war is only getting worse. In its last few months, the country has been rocked by an unprecedented number of bombings and attacks on targets in Baghdad, including a truck bomb that exploded outside a Shiite mosque. The recent surge of violence has seen at least 200 people killed in the past two weeks alone. And just last week, a police officer was killed and four others wounded after they tried to disarm a group of armed militants who were attacking a police post in the central province of Diyala.|0
"LITCHFIELD, Maine ( AP ) — A Maine woman is trying to protect a series of osprey nests atop her home by building a wooden shed to keep the birds from flying into it. The bird nesting was discovered early Saturday when an elderly couple noticed a pair of young eagles were perched on the top of their house in Leominster Township, about 60 miles southwest of Portland, and called authorities. ""They're so curious,"" said neighbor Susan Johnson. ""So we just had to call and ask what it was all about."""|0
"Judy Watson watched as the California Poppy Reserve was established in the 1970s just five miles from her home. It now has nearly 1,000 acres and more than 7,000 cultivated poppy plants. The reserve includes several varieties of the flower. ""When we planted the first plant, it didn't have much bloom. So we were a bit worried,"" said Watson. It was a cold January evening when I decided to spend a day with my new best friend. After some research about how to introduce our friendship to others, we met up for dinner and a movie."|0
Who is K P Sharma Oli? The new prime minister of Nepal, K P Sharma Oli gained popularity on Twitter because of his open-hearted manner of interacting with the nation on social media. The United States military, like other countries, has a variety of weapons systems used to kill large numbers of people. What are the most powerful? There are several different types and designs of assault weapons available for sale worldwide. While they all do the same thing — shoot a bullet in a group of human beings — some may be more lethal than others.|0
The Brexit crowd refused to believe the experts in the run-up to the referendum vote. The warnings from every leading economic body, including the Bank of England, were dismissed as scaremongering that should be ignored. Now, apparently, the words of the Governor of the Bank of England and other economists are so influential they can talk us into a recession – I am baffled by this double-think. But we need not agonise over all the talk now, because the facts are mounting up. Last week, we reported exclusive figures showing a sharp fall in the number of shoppers out on our high streets.|1
So the latest Star Wars game has made tea-bagging Darth Vader’s smug Jedi son’s face an international sport. There are worse fates than tea-bagging, young Skywalker. Let us show you. Why, he could be a guest star in Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric for example. Or maybe he’s stuck in some horrible, inescapable limbo. And while we here at Kotaku really love Delaware and hope they can take a joke, what we don’t love is seeing one of our childhood heroes at his lowest. He’s transparent, he seems upset—you’re halfway there.|1
For three turbulent centuries, the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into the hearts of seafarers seeking to cross the wide ocean. But with the beginning of World War One, that fearsome sight became a quaint relic of a past lost to history. On Monday, The Washington Post reported that the Trump administration planned to cut off funding to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), an organization that is home to about 200 world museums dedicated to culture, science, and education.|0
Hi, National Geographic, it's me, Ryan. I got your package today and I guess I'm wondering - why did you send me a pseudoscientific crystal healing water bottle with your name on it? National Geographic, usually known for photos of animals and the adventures of rich people visiting other countries, is premiering their Will Smith-narrated, Darren Aronofsky-produced series, One Strange Rock, on March 26. I had a chance to watch one of the episodes at a screener last month - it was fine and very wide-eyed. There were lots of shots of Earth from space.|1
We've picked our top five favorite trailers from this year's awards show  arguably, more fun to watch than the show itself! The 2013 Spike VGX awards have come and gone. Say what you will about video games award shows  and trust us, plenty of people are  but they do make for an excellent time for developers to show off what they're cooking up across the next few months (or years). To us, at least, it doesn't really matter who wins and loses; the trailers that tease all the hot new games in development are the real prize.|1
New York/London: Volatility returned to US markets, with stocks tumbling back toward a bear market after the biggest rally in nearly a decade evaporates. The dollar gave up some of the previous session’s advances. Oil slipped below $46 a barrel. The S&P 500 sank more than 2.4%, unable to add to a 5% surge that was the biggest since March 2009. Technology and consumer shares that led the gain were among the biggest decliners Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 500 points, after its first 1,000 point gain.|1
The Jewish-American advocacy group J Street, which bills itself as the dovish alternative to the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), said in a recent analysis that, based on how much money Congress has allocated to its budget and who it represents in both houses, President Trump will have little left over to fund the U.S. State Department under his proposed 2018 budget. For the third time since 2007, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has taken the unusual measure of voting for a proposition that does not yet exist.|0
What Motivates People To Break The Rules At Work? A look at what drives workplace rule-breaking, and when they’re worth stopping or encouraging. You probably know the employee who takes a stack of Post-It notes with him out the door every Friday afternoon. Or the one that takes an ample amount of sick days, but managed the strength to go to the football game. What about the person who’s otherwise brilliant, but bends company policies to her will–and is promoted? We’ve all told white lies in life, and at work.|1
SHAH ALAM ( THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK ) - The High Court in Shah Alam has rejected a bid to quash an appeal against a lower court judgment awarding the award of Rs.10 lakh to a widow who said her marriage was annulled on the ground she had not remarried.

A Houston district court judge who lost a re-election bid on Tuesday is facing criticism for releasing a majority of the juvenile defendants who appeared before him Wednesday after allegedly asking them whether they planned to kill anyone. District Court Judge Glenn Devlin, a Republican, lost his seat Tuesday to Democratic opponent Natalia Oakes — in a wave of 59 conservative jurists who had been ousted by Harris County voters, NBC Houston affiliate KPRC reported. And on Wednesday morning, Devlin had made a decision that shocked Steve Halpert, juvenile division chief for Harris County's Public Defender's Office.|1

US Attorney John Parker of the Northern District of Texas announced an SEO named William Stanley has been sentenced to 37 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $174,888 in restitution to a dozen identified victims for attempting to extort money from a business in Dallas. In November 2009, GE entered into a contract with Stanley for SEO services and reputation management. Stanley was hired because of his ability to improve a firm’s online reputation through search results.|1
"Clinton said this week paid family leave is possible by taxing the wealthy but states have done so without soaking the poor: ""I'm certainly not in favor of mandating that all people do it. We can legislate a fair system."" It seems like every other day there is another story breaking about someone or some organization claiming they had their computer compromised, hacked, stolen or sold. So why is everyone getting so worked up about these incidents? The simple answer to that is because we don't want them to happen to you."|0
Sean Bean has made a career of being around royalty in epic fantasy. He was the heir to the throne when A Song of Ice and Fire aired on HBO in 2011, so we can't complain too much. However, there are certain aspects of the show that have made it an icon. There is the fact that this series is filled with incredibly well-drawn characters, especially those of highborn stock. And while he may be familiar to the casual fantasy reader thanks to his roles as Bran Stark and Oberyn Martell, Bean is no stranger to Game of Thrones himself.|0
The Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association, of which this reporter is a member, has named Moonlight as the best film of 2016, as part of the results of its 23rd annual critics’ poll.

The tenth* annual Woodstock of skepticism, The Amaz!ng Meeting, was just announced for 2012! It’ll be July 12-15 at the Southpoint Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The guest list, as always, is impressive, featuring a lot of familiar faces and a few I don’t know that well. But that’s the point; have some people who are old hands at this, and then bring in new blood to mix it up as well. I’m really glad to see the list changing up every year, so that new voices are heard.|1
American troops may have finally left Iraq, but for that nation's citizens the war is only getting worse. American troops may have finally left Iraq, but for that nation's citizens the war is only getting worse. More than 700 people, mostly civilians, were killed in violent attacks last month, making it the deadliest calendar month since June 2008. Nearly all of those killed were attacked in the capital of Baghdad. The sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims has escalated in recent months, and the minority Sunnis have turned up the protests of the Shia-led government—leading to violent confrontations with police.|1
The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep. That is the provocative implication of recent research that examined investors’ financial risk-taking following periods when their sleep was disrupted. I concede that advice to get more sleep is hardly new, since we’ve been hearing that most of our lives — and the advice is honored more in the breach than in the observance. Furthermore, retirees typically would like to sleep more, but can’t — due to the disruptions in sleep patterns that are a normal part of the aging process.|1
"Jane partners with a mysterious man from her past, as the team works to prevent a dangerous arms deal between Russia and China. In September, I was thrilled when my favorite actor, Sean Penn, announced that he would be starring in the movie adaptation of my novel, A Voice for Men, which chronicles his journey into the world of men's rights activism and activism against violence against women. In case you've forgotten, A Voice for Men is a feminist manifesto written by an anonymous writer known only as ""Sargon""."|0

Made of Q-Tips, this craft goes far beyond a miniature garland or cake topper. The light strand also has the potential to be used as part of a bracelet, ring, and pendant that can be worn with any other piece of jewelry — whether it's a pendant, bracelets, rings, or more. For example, this is a perfect gift for a mother who wants to remind her baby she is there for him no matter what. Or for anyone who wants to add some color to an otherwise all black outfit.|0
"Mission of Burma: Signals, Calls, and Marches / Vs.
Thirty years later, Mission of Burma still sounds like the future. Mission of Burma is a band with a lot to offer acolytes of cool post-punk minimalism who prefer a little anthemic arena rock and musical invention with their explorations of modern sterility. The Boston trio of Roger Miller, Clint Conley, and Peter Prescott brought exuberance and lyricism to their noise rock, producing only one full-length studio album before disbanding in 1983. Producer Martin Swope added the tape effects that lend the band its dreamlike, blurred-around-the-edges sound."|1
CINCINNATI -- As FC Cincinnati fans chanted and cheered for taxpayers to help fund a Major League Soccer stadium, the city council made a big win by approving a $25 million tax break for a proposed 10-year, $250 million arena project. Council voted 18-1 to approve a $25 million tax break for a new home for FC Cincinnati. The tax break is part of a three-year deal that will end at the end of July 2018. In an effort to jump-start construction on the new facility, Gov. John Kasich announced last month he was bringing state incentives to the table as well.|0
However, T.I. insists that she's just as creative as any other rap artist in the game. In fact, she claims her album was influenced by an 18 year old girl who told her that she'd never thought to start a career as an artist until she started writing music.

Although state trademark registration offers fewer benefits than trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, state trademark registration can be a cheap alternative for securing limited trademark rights. Federal trademark registration can run anywhere from several hundred dollars to $3,000, depending on the type of mark being registered and the amount of attorney's fees. On the other hand, many states charge less than $100 to file a trademark application. Keep in mind that state registration will not offer multi-state protection, nationwide priority status, incontestability, a presumption of validity or the ability to file a trademark on an intent to use basis.|1
"Should Bikes Be Allowed On Muni Metro? A recent news report on an injured cyclist denied passage on the N Judah because she was carrying her (unfolded) bike received no small amount of attention this week, and now transit advocates are asking why bikes are unequivocally banned from Muni light rail vehicles at all.

The Australian telecommunications ( telco ) industry is largely responsible for the highly connected and digital world we live in. So it comes as a shock to read that, at least in its early years, Telstra was notorious for failing to provide its customers with consistent and accurate broadband connections. It took almost a decade for the Coalition Government to finally address this issue. There is nothing new about the death of a woman on a commuter train. There has been a spate of cases of passengers being fatally stabbed or crushed on UK railways over the past 12 months.|0

"To any objective observer, the consensus that exists between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the fundamental issues of the campaign is that they are ""deadlocked"" -- dead even, at this point -- on the basic policies of the next president. It will come as a great shock to millions of voters if they do actually manage to vote for Mr. Obama in November. Even worse, it will also come as a great shock to millions of Americans whose support for his candidacy they have already given to others in hopes of stopping him from becoming President."|0

The actress kept fairly mum on whether the pair was headed toward an engagement but offered an optimistic note on their relationship.|1
Akshara Haasan had what you would call a dream debut in Bollywood with ‘ Shamitabh ’. While the 2015 film starred Amitabh Bachchan and Raveena Kapoor, it turned out to be “a mess” on screen. It didn’t perform well at the box office either, earning only Rs 35 crore ($5 million) between its opening week and its third weekend. The US government's decision to stop paying $100 million in annual interest on Iran sanctions relief could cost the oil industry more than $2 billion in losses over the next decade, according to an industry analysis.|0
The Scimitar-horned Oryx no longer lives in the African desert. It is considered extinct in the wild. But this lovely-looking Ungulate hasn’t been completely wiped out because they can still be found at zoos around the world. It’s just one example of a new role that zoos have taken on: preserving endangered wildlife. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lists 361 endangered mammals worldwide. Add in birds, fish, reptiles and other living creatures, that number rises to nearly 1200. That’s why the work of organizations like the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute – or SCBI – is so crucial.|1
With the lessons of 2014 fresh in their collective memory and the 2016 election cycle about to start, progressive groups and Democrats have been making a sustained push to highlight policies to boost incomes for the poor and middle class and fight income inequality. The Democrats on the House Budget Committee outlined a plan in January to create a $1,000 tax credit for every worker making less than $100,000 annually, financed by eliminating some tax exemptions and deductions for high earners. The Center for American Progress released a series of policy recommendations for “ensuring that middle- and lower-income households are the substantial beneficiaries” of economic growth.|1

"Some Zimbabwe government supporters say President Robert Mugabe should form a government without the opposition, following an opposition boycott.


"" I'm not going out of the party,"" says former presidential hopeful Grace Mugabe, who was barred from standing for another term in September after her ZANU-PF party decided not to participate in the vote. The two countries have long had a complex history. Mugabe took power in 1980 and has ruled Zimbabwe for most of the last 42 years. But as the economy has improved under Mugabe, he has tried to strengthen ties with neighbouring South Africa, whose new leaders have also sought to strengthen relations with Zimbabwe."|0

We chose to question the narrative of history by simply quoting words which Churchill used himself. At a glance, Blighty Café appears to be another one of those trendy and sophisticated coffee shops that offer the terribly appealing combination of tasteful beverages, off-beat music and the inviting aroma of freshly-baked sourdough bread.

Except, sitting in the mock air-raid shelter, drinking my flat white, I couldn’t help but feel ever more uncomfortable.|1

"Damn, aside from Tom Tykwer desperately trying to get out of there at the 30 minute mark, and I can't blame him. ""It's not that we didn't like them, it's that they weren't good enough."" That phrase was uttered by some players during their postgame press conference after the Eagles beat the Redskins 24-13 on Sunday. The sentiment is an accurate description of the outcome of several games in which the Eagles (7-4) came up one quarter short of matching a franchise-record for points in a loss."|0

A FAKE doctor allegedly used useless metal rods to test people for cancer and diabetes then charged a fortune to see if any of them turned out to be cancer-stricken victims. A woman was taken to hospital by ambulance with a lump in her throat, but the doctor failed to provide any information about the diagnosis. The medical malpractice suit is being brought by a lawyer who has also been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. In another case, a woman was rushed to hospital in tears after she was administered two metal rods to check whether she might have an enlarged prostate.|0

The Volstead Act was repealed on this date in 1933, returning control of alcohol to the states, and it is still a federal crime for someone under age 21 to sell, manufacture or dispense alcohol. Federal law forbids people younger than 21 from having access to alcohol, but many state governments have enacted laws that specifically permit drinking under certain conditions. There are many other ways you can help prevent child abuse by drinking responsibly.

On the American side, there was the slushy tendency towards sentimentality, for which he became increasingly known, which, at its best, resulted in Dead Poets Society, The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire, and, at its worst, became Patch Adams and Old Dogs. Hollywood has long had a tendency to adopt the finest and most interesting comedians and then determinedly blunt the hard edges that make them interesting. Along with Richard Pryor, Williams was the most obvious example of that.|1

The Oregon Liquor Control Commission re-evaluated penalties after reviewing compliance from recent sting operations.|1
Iqbal Survé’s Sagarmatha Technologies, which failed to list on the JSE a year ago, has set its sights on an offshore listing, according to Survé’s newspaper Business Report. Sagarmatha, a technology company within the Sekunjalo investment group, has already made an application to the SA Reserve Bank, the publication said, citing Survé, the chair of Independent Media. In early 2018, Sagarmatha’s listing on the JSE — along with a mooted listing in New York — was scuppered by its failure to submit financial statements on time.|1
"CB Tramaine Brock on WR DeAndrew White: ""I feel like he’s got it all."" SANTA CLARA – Cornerback Tramaine Brock spoke in the 49ers’ auditorium Wednesday afternoon. Here are selected quotes. Q: Has there been much of an adjustment to the new defense being installed this year? BROCK: Yeah, it’s a whole different package. Q: How does that affect you? BROCK: As a corner, it’s still man, Cover 4, Cover 3 – it’s just a whole different package. It really doesn’t affect me as much."|1

Steve Norris is former Conservative transport minister. Britain can reasonably claim to have invented the railway. Stephenson’s Rocket represented the pinnacle of British industrial-era innovation. The ability to move products and people by steam locomotion had a transformative effect on society. British ingenuity saw railways knit communities together across the country, and eventually the globe. And for the next couple of centuries, little changed. The same techniques are being used to maintain track now that were used in Stephenson’s time."|1
"AUSTIN — Rep. Rafael Anchia filed a resolution Monday condemning President Donald Trump's executive order restricting travel to the United States from six majority-Muslim countries. ""The President and his administration are taking this action for their own political purposes, and there must be an immediate halt to this policy,"" Anchia said in a statement. ""As a Puerto Rican, I do not believe it is right that our citizens should be treated differently because of who they are or where they live. We cannot afford to wait for Congress to act on this issue."""|0
"Surgical Strike Day : State Education minister Partha Chatterjee yesterday criticised the central government alleging that the UGC's direction has been ""misguided"". In a written reply to Rajya Sabha, he said: ""We have taken strong objection to this direction. The Supreme Court had held in 2004 that there is no need for state governments to provide special education to children below class VIII who have not attained their upper secondary qualifications.

"This week, in a closed-door meeting of Congressional Democrats with President Obama, Representative Ed Perlmutter of Colorado bluntly said what has been on many politicians' minds: ""Larry Summers. Bad choice."" Mr. Obama was visibly annoyed and mounted a defense of Mr. Summers, his former economic policy adviser who also served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Summers, who the president said had become something of a ""progressive whipping boy,"" appears to be a strong contender to succeed Ben S. Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve."|1

In recent years, platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their artistry. For the generation of designers who grew up playing “Super Mario Bros.” platformers offer a sound formula. Though the goal of such games is usually to get from one area to the next, that framework supports copious possibilities. Determining how a character moves through a world and what sorts of things should impede or assist in the process allows plenty of room for creativity. It is why games like “Journey” and “Inside” can both be constructed around jumping avatars but otherwise appear quite distinct.|1
Like the IRS Scandal, Texas Speaker Straus is attacking conservative non-profit groups and even churches! ACTION ALERT! GOVERNOR RICK PERRY MUST VETO THIS BILL SB 346! One of the top Chairmen for Joe Straus, Charlie Geren, has pushed a bill (SB 346) through the Texas House that, like the recent Obama IRS scandal, would attack Texas conservative non-profit groups by demanding that they reveal who gives money to them. This bill would even attack churches and religious groups who do not get involved in partisan politics and only stand for issues like pro-life and pro-marriage!|1

Where will he wake up next? A prison cell? A tropical hammock? Or suspended on a cliff? It has the makings of a pretty good TV show, in the vein of Quantum Leap. Each day, a man wakes up to find himself in a different bed in a different part of the world. The experience, while clearly always disorienting, can vary dramatically based on the circumstances. Some days he’s in prison, or squatting in a storage bin. Other mornings he wakes up in a goat pen or a tropical hammock.|1
Around 2.54 million new cars were registered in 2017 compared with 2.69 million the previous year. More than 157,000 of those vehicles were on the road in Germany, according to preliminary data released by the German auto-industry association (BDI) on Wednesday. In 2016, more than 164,000 new cars were registered in Germany, or nearly double the number registered during 2015. The BDI said 1.23 million cars are currently registered in Germany, while 1.14 million are sold in Germany each year. However, there has not been much impact on overall car sales across the world, the BDI said.|0
PENTICTON, British Columbia -- Connor Hellebuyck doesn't want to ruffle any feathers, but he's not planning to make any new linemates this season. It's been a while since I've posted anything from the UK, but it is so worth the wait! I have had my eye on this beauty for about a year or so. It looks great on paper, and even has some great photos (which I won't spoil here!). I bought it on ebay because it came with an 18″ monitor which was pretty awesome, and I couldn't pass up this gorgeous piece of artwork.|0

(Reuters) - For U.S. media companies and investors, it was the ruling of the decade. A federal judge in Washington had sole power to decide whether telecoms company AT&T Inc could buy Time Warner Inc, the parent of HBO, CNN and Warner Bros, for $85 billion and reshape the U.S. media landscape. After a six-week long trial, Judge Richard Leon set a hearing date of June 12 at 4 p.m. (2000 GMT) to announce his ruling. People were so keen to get a seat in his courtroom that they took turns standing in line more than 24 hours ahead of the event.|1
The husband of a woman suspected of cutting a fetus out of another woman told police he found the baby “gasping” in a bathroom at their home, shortly after the attack, according to court documents obtained by Reuters.

"We chose to question the narrative of history by simply quoting words which Churchill used himself. At a glance, Churchill could not be clearer when he claimed that Germany was on the verge of collapse during the year of 1919. However, an investigation of his words has revealed that he did not really use the phrase ""in the last stages of its decline"" as we are likely to remember it today. In reality, he had been speaking of the general state of affairs in 1914 when Britain declared war against Germany. He did not believe that the German people were prepared to go to war."|0
Where will he wake up next? A prison cell? A tropical hammock? Or suspended on a cliff in the Australian outback? To answer that question, Wojahn’s first instinct is to try to remember how he got here.

We just made the dream a reality when we opened our doors for the first time in October 2015.|0
Fast bowler Matt Hobden has been tipped for a bright future as he bids to bounce back from one of the darkest days in his fledgling career. Hobden’s encouraging start to the season came to a grinding halt in the previous Championship match against Middlesex at Hove. The 22-year-old from Eastbourne lost his rhythm completely as he committed 11 no-balls in 16 overs in the first innings and another three in the second. His struggles were highlighted by an injury to Ajmal Shahzad on the opening day which prevented skipper Ed Joyce from withdrawing him from the attack.|1

The report, which was released Tuesday, suggests the trend toward lighter-weight and smaller-sized watches has begun to slow.|0
Beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl is never easy. When they scored 21 points the first three times they held the ball in the second half and took a 33-32 lead, we all thought the same scary movie we’ve seen since 2001 was replaying before our eyes. But this epic brought a different ending. This one saw Foles, a man of faith who wants to be a pastor when he leaves the game, play as if touched by God. He completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.|1
Banking giant Standard Chartered on Tuesday announced a return of dividends for shareholders after a two-year hiatus as it reported a net loss of £527 million in the third quarter, compared with a profit of £1.2 billion a year earlier. S&P said its first dividend since 2012 would bring in £1.8 billion, or around 1.5 per cent, more than last time. This will help the bank to meet its ambitious targets for earnings by 2019. On Sunday, New York Yankees reliever David Robertson and outfielder Aaron Hicks were suspended for the first 5 games of the season for violating MLB's anti-drug policy.|0
How will fuel prices and driving in Europe be affected by Brexit? Following the momentous decision taken today by the European Union to exit the EU single market, Britain will leave the world's largest market for cars. British motorists will also have an increased number of car dealerships across Europe which will need to deal with increasing numbers of UK citizens moving over to buy new vehicles as they move back to their countries of origin.

It's not your imagination—but you should blame the candidates, not the media. The father in question has voiced similar complaints. “I think it’s a big mistake; this constant four-year, peripatetic campaign is not good for America. We need to deal with the business we have before us,” Bill Clinton told CNN in December. Of course, neither Clinton is a particularly reliable narrator here, because it’s the third member of the Clinton clan who is responsible for much of the ink that has been spilled about an election still more than two and a half years away.|1
The proposal that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to stem migration is nothing but 'hipster'colonialism. Last year, the European Union agreed to provide nearly €700 million (US$1.7bn) in loans and financial assistance over the next four years to African countries such as Mali, Mauritania and Burkina Faso to stop their refugees from making dangerous sea crossings. It has also promised to set up temporary reception centres for Africans in its 27 member states. Hollywood continues to be an early adopter of augmented reality.

Other events add to the excitement. They, too, are a lot of work. But they add up to a great feeling of celebration that gives us a moment to reflect on the things we love about our country.

AMD's Ryzen CPUs offer some of the best bang for the buck, but which is best? AMD says that its upcoming Ryzen processors are better than Intel's offerings thanks to higher core count, high clocks, and more cores. Unfortunately, AMD isn't offering any details on exactly how it achieved such impressive results. Still, it's hard to disagree with what the chipmaker says — especially if you don't have a vested interest in the matter. We're already excited about the Ryzen CPU, so we're very curious to see how things stack up against Intel's latest architecture.|0

In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don ’ t report to any government office or agency (e.g., central bank), whose activities are regulated by boards of directors appointed by the public, and whose assets are held under trust for the public, which in turn has oversight by independent auditors. These companies are also publicly traded; thus, they can benefit from investors' buying and selling policies. They do so on the basis of a profit-and-loss statement that details revenue, expenses, and profits.|0

Chipolo Plus is supposedly the loudest Bluetooth item tracker available today, and its chirpy tune can be heard from a greater distance than other similar trackers.

So can you tell the difference between those dB levels? In my tests, I could indeed hear Chipolo Plus a little bit better than the other trackers, though the difference is subtle.|1

There is broad agreement that moving patient records into the computer age is essential to improving care and curbing costs for all U.S. patients. But how can a computer do what a physician or other human being cannot? It was late on Sunday night, April 10, 1995, at the American Academy of Pediatrics conference in Baltimore.

Nintendo’s ancient Power Glove remains a part of popular culture because, one, it was an epic, ET: The Game-style failure and, two, because it was a power glove.

Still, most attempts to recreate the power glove mentality, to let you use your hands to naturally manipulate digital objects in three dimensions, have been failures.|1

In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don’t report to presidents. In Russia, things are different. Most of those businesses are majority-state-owned corporations, virtual branches of the government. And that means when you talk to the head of a Russian bank or oil company, you are effectively talking to the Kremlin. In 2000, when Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency, he consolidated competing power centers — media, business, local government, opposition parties and the Parliament — under his authority. He called it “a vertical of power.” This system now includes organized crime and cybercriminals.|1

French President Emmanuel Macron wants to invigorate the European Union as a global power and spurn the populist nationalism that threatens to undermine its success. But he knows it requires cooperation with the United States—which makes his strange bedfellow in the White House so crucial to his agenda. This piece originally appeared in the Washington Post. Macron, who at 40 is three decades younger than Trump, disdains the president’s abrasive nature and many of his policies, notably on Iran and climate change. The French president prefers books, ideas and lofty intellectual conversation to the aggressive transactional style embodied by Trump, who favors television over written text.|1

For three turbulent centuries, the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into the hearts of medieval Europeans. Indeed, the Viking Age, from A.D. 800-1100, was the age of the sleek, speedy longship. Without this crucial advance in ship technology, the Vikings would never have become a dominant force in medieval warfare, politics, and trade. With their invention of the longship, the Vikings spurred a literal sea change in medieval European affairs. The drekar, or dragon-headed longships, were stealthy troop-carriers.|1

Holwell Sports reached their first Senior County Cup final in 17 years on Tuesday evening after a penalty shoot-out win over Eastleigh. It has been nearly half a century since a woman won the women's race to become world track and field leader, which means it is time for a look back at the sport's greatest female athletes.

Bavarian farmers are angry that their famous Alpine dairy cows will apparently have to wear nappies under European Union environmental rules because they don�t meet safety guidelines. The country�s two leading milk producers, Sauerbrunn and Grupo Pembroke, told local media that the new regulations from the European Commission on livestock welfare will mean the loss of up to 20 percent of their annual milk production. The German-founded industry association says it is a precautionary measure taken in an effort to avoid the problems that led to the shutdown of the country�s former flagship dairy last year following an investigation into the deaths of more than 30 calves.|0

A syrah lover finds hope in the Northwest, but sticks to his guns about the failure of many to reach their potential. Several weeks back, I wrote a column about syrah, in which I asserted that this great if temperamental varietal has tremendous potential, but along its journey from grape to wine often gets lost, mugged or tired. You hope and hope and hope, too frequently arriving at disappointment. Syrah is like soccer: 90 loping minutes of play for a final score of 2-1. I love watching soccer, and I love following syrah.|1
Akshara Haasan had what you would call a dream debut in Bollywood with ‘Shamitabh’. While the 2015 film was helmed by R Balki, the debutante actress none other than Amitabh Bachchan and Tamil superstar Dhanush as her co-actors.

To any objective observer, the consensus that exists between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the fundamental issues of war and peace, Wall Street’s dominance of American life, and fiscal austerity, has been made crystal clear in the two “debates.” In the absence of effective popular resistance to the duopoly of money, the economic and social crisis fails to create a corresponding political crisis for the rulers. As a result, there is nothing important for them to debate. The two titans of America’s finance capitalist duopoly clashed – leaving behind a dull fart.|1

Beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl is never easy. When they scored 21 points the first three times last season and then fell behind 17-3 in the final two minutes to New England, that's when you knew things were about to get bad for the Falcons.

Julio Jones caught nine passes for 104 yards and an interception. Dez Bryant had a team-high 12 receptions for 127 yards and a touchdown.|0

Jordin Sparks lit up the 2014 Billboard Music Awards red carpet! The tall 'Tattoo' singer flaunted her legs in a tight little black dress. The halter neckline showed off her sculpted shoulders, while the sequins on the garment added a touch of sparkle. Jordin added a pop of color to the outfit with a bright orange clutch. Although the black and orange color combo could have looked a little Halloween, the subtle accessory was just enough to add a zing without looking too costumey.

America is voting Tuesday to fill the country's top job opening. The country also has over five million people who want to become citizens — a figure that will grow to nearly 7.8 million if President Obama wins re-election. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, however, insists that the immigration reform effort can only gain momentum if Congress passes the comprehensive immigration bill that Sen. Charles Schumer has vowed to introduce on his way out the door next year. But even if they could get their legislation passed, the labor group said it would probably not make a dent in the high number of Americans without citizenship.|0
BANGKOK (Reuters) - The leader of Thailand’s military junta said on Thursday that Yingluck Shinawatra, the prime minister he ousted three years ago, was in Dubai, where she fled last month to avoid being jailed over a rice subsidy scheme that lost billions of dollars.

His remarks came a day after the country’s top court found Yingluck guilty of criminal negligence and sentenced her in absentia to five years in prison.|1

And, if you're an Oregon-based winemaker trying to expand into New York or San Francisco, it can be quite costly.

I'm not saying this has happened to everyone. It's just what I've been able to discover.|0

A new study for The New York Times reveals that the media pay for the top 200 CEOs is now $14.5 million. This is up 55 in the last year. While any one CEO may be well worth his/her raise, it is a growing political and PR problem for corporate America to be seen as rewarding those at the top, with little consideration for actual performance. For millions of Americans who are unemployed, under employed and being foreclosed on, it seems inconceivable that corporate CEOs can be getting significant raises at a time of such economic hardship.|1

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Democrat John Edwards endorsed former rival Barack Obama on Wednesday, a move designed to help solidify support for the party’s likely presidential nominee even as Hillary Rodham Clinton refuses to give up her long-shot candidacy. The endorsement came a day after Clinton defeated Obama by more than 2-to-1 in the West Virginia primary. The loss highlighted Obama’s challenge in winning over the “Hillary Democrats” — white, working-class voters who also supported Edwards in significant numbers before he exited the race in late January. He said Obama “stands with me” in a fight to cut poverty in half within 10 years.|1

I’m still not convinced Foreman is the answer — they’d be crazy not to draft a running back next year — but for now Foreman might get goalline work and has speed to do a little more. When Cooper Kupp sustained an ACL tear, the question was whether Reynolds could step into his role as an equal partner in the Rams’ pass-catching triumvirate. He leaped the first hurdle with flying colors: six catches for 80 yards and a score against the Chiefs. The Rams operate out of three-receiver 11 personnel an insane 98 percent of time, per sharpfootballstats.com.|1
Maybe you need to leave the office at 5 p.m. on the dot every Thursday to pick up your daughter from school. You know that there are hundreds of other people in the field who will be able to assist you, and that they will also need help.

The more children you have, the greater the burden of care on your parents and the greater likelihood of financial hardship.|0
"ANTIOCH 6/5/16 – When Trevor Dunning first entered the Trinity Christian School speech class, he was personally greeted, as each student was, and a few words of welcome were exchanged. He stood out with his solid physique, and soft intense face. However, the moment he spoke, his struggles became obvious. While talking, he would suddenly push out a breathy deep, ""UHH...UHH,"" which came every three of four words. It was a severe stutter problem. He had enrolled in my speech class to hopefully be able to speak better."|1
In a small way, we made history. Last Saturday, an ad hoc group of citizens interested in environmental justice organized at the site of a proposed coal mine. The goal was to highlight the ecological, social, financial and political impact of mining, and also to send a powerful message to the government that climate change is an immediate and urgent concern. At the last minute, they announced that the campaign would have to be shut down because it was being funded by the fossil fuel industry, which has come out against action on climate change, despite having spent millions of dollars to promote this issue.|0

When I opened the brown clasp envelope and pulled out the 21-page spiral book, I was startled. Dr. Jones is not a pianist. I’ve been having a good laugh at myself about it these last few weeks. (I guess I really do need hearing aids.) I told the story when I spoke to the Barrington Hall Garden Club last week, and the ladies got a chuckle out of it. Dr. Jones is passionate about peonies. At one time, he had 120 peony plants blooming in the backyard of his former home on Hillandale Circle.|1
"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi routinely lands up at the airport to receive world dignitaries. From the moment a VIP gets into the jet, he or she is surrounded by thousands of ""hand-holding"" fans who stand patiently with their cameras and flashlights to offer high-fives and selfies. It has become a routine that goes back decades in India, and it has become a symbol of the country's modern-day success. But there is a growing unease among India's politicians over the use of such celebrations as they struggle to address problems such as soaring unemployment, crippling pollution, and chronic under-investment in infrastructure."|0

Most Janus cats don't live for more than a few days, but Frank and Louie's unusually long lives are due to an unusual genetic trait. The cats were born in China and are now in the care of a cat rescue group in San Francisco.

Veterinarians say that it is difficult to estimate exactly how often the cats' lives are impacted by this rare bone cancer.

In 1890, a group of eight large New York City bakeries combined to form the New York Biscuit Company and built a giant six-story factory in West Chelsea. Eight years later, they merged with their competitor, Chicago's American Biscuit and Manufacturing to form an even larger conglomerate – the National Biscuit Company, but the factory and headquarters remained in Chelsea. In 1901, the National Biscuit Company put their abbreviated company name on a box of wafers for the first time – Nabisco. Soon, Nabisco became the company's official name.|1
Two capitals are look set to burst through the 40C mark and another swelters through its 10th day of a record-breaking summer.

Will an upcoming vote in Congress signal the end of Medicare?

Two years ago, Red Sox prospect Ryan Westmoreland seemed to be on the fast track to the majors.

In 60 games with the Spinners, the outfielder hit .296 with seven homers and 19 stolen bases, and his five-tool potential helped him quickly ascend up everyone's list of top Red Sox prospects. But all of that changed in a hurry when, in March of 2010, he was diagnosed with a cavernous malformation in his brain.|1

I lived in Oshkosh for 14 years up until 2003. My hangar was adjacent to the self-serve. Our shop had about 40 or 50 customers a day. We made all the repairs, and some of them could take hours.

The AKP should take comfort in its large majority and start to view minority views and even peaceful dissent benignly. The outcome of Turkey's latest general election - voters have gone to the polls twice in the last five months - reveals important insights into the nature of the country's democracy and the preferences of its citizens. The first of Turkey's two parliamentary elections this year, in June, was widely viewed as a referendum on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's efforts to strengthen the powers of his office.

Let’s dispense with the question of whether Democrat Ralph Northam is being treated unfairly. His grievous political wounds — by Monday, virtually all Democratic Party luminaries in the state and most Democratic presidential hopefuls had called on him to resign — are self-inflicted. When the photograph from Northam’s Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook surfaced Friday, his first reaction was to issue a statement of abject apology. Tactically, in terms of crisis management, that was the right move — own the transgression and say unambiguously that you’re sorry.|1

An extra $190,000 in state special education reimbursement funding that came in late last month has helped the town pay off its nearly half million-dollar settlement with the district's bus drivers union, officials said this week. Together with around $300,000 in savings found in the district's fiscal 2011 budget, the money has covered the town's $497,000 obligation to the drivers, whose jobs have been outsourced to a private busing company.

Will an upcoming vote in Congress signal the end of Medicare? In the next few weeks Congress will decide whether to cut $54 billion in overpayments to Medicare insurers, igniting a battle that may well determine whether the program survives. On one side are Medicare supporters, who want it to continue as a successful social insurance program. On the other is the insurance industry, which is spending millions and lobbying hard to put Medicare on a fast track to privatization, a goal long sought by fiscal conservatives and their allies in right-wing think tanks.|1

Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child’s play, thanks to MIT. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a parser that imitates kids’ learning processes by observing the environment and making connections. The system studies captioned videos and learns to associate words with objects and actions. When given a new sentence, the parser can accurately predict its meaning—without visual clues. This “weakly supervised” approach, which requires limited training input, could expand the types of data and reduce the effort needed for training parsers. Annotations can certainly speed up the process, but they’re not needed to learn.|1

Labour leader Ed Miliband doesn't have an image problem, he has a policy problem. The problem is that the Labour party has been seen as having no policy at all on the most basic of issues - how are you going to pay for tuition fees and student debt?

MANCHESTER UNITED outcast Morgan Schneiderlin has emerged as a January target for Inter Milan, according to reports. Schneiderlin has fallen down the pecking order at Manchester United under Jose Mourinho.

One 15-year-old girl from Russia loved sharing her image on social media. She would take selfies whenever the mood struck her, which was often, and then share them via her phone with her friends, followers, and the world at large.

Big Papi has tormented the Yankees over the years, pounding 52 homers against them (51 as a member of the Sox), and taking forever to round the bases after each one. Yes, there are some who speculate whether Ortiz did PEDs and won't like the idea of Ortiz being honored on the Stadium field because of that.|1
JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar : for most, it was a routine visit to an ancient site under Israeli control.

Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the hard work required to maintain it.

The cemetery, designated a historic site by the Washington County Historical Society, has ties to the founders of Mars Inc., the giant candy manufacturing company.|1
Boulder has sued the fossil fuel companies. Probably 15 percent or so of us would be alive today without fossil fuels since without them we would be living in the Middle Ages without medicines, electricity, real sanitation, etc. Those of us who did not die in childbirth or by an infection caused by a scratch could enjoy living a short life behind an animal pulling a wooden plow. Maybe it would be best if we recognize that fossil fuels had their role, evolve our power supplies to renewable, storable resources, and stop demonizing everyone.|1

Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of flaws in the way universal credit is designed, campaigners say. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG ) said arbitrary rules built in to the way universal credit is calculated leave some families unable to predict how much they will be paid each month, leaving households in debt and unable to budget. It can lead to claimants being wrongly benefit-capped – a penalty designed to “incentivise” jobless or low-earning households by severely limiting their benefits – because the system fails to spot they are working and earning enough.|1

The United States has just released its annual list of the countries where the largest number of children under 18 die each year from preventable causes. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on the right to health said last year that ""children's lives are endangered by the excessive use of force and lack of adequate healthcare"" in more than half of all armed conflict zones."|0
After seven seasons together with the Cubs, could the Theo Trio be on the verge of a breakup? That could depend on the Giants. Or the Mets.

The Giants job opened Monday with Bobby Evans’ firing. “I’m not actively looking because of how great things are here,” said McLeod, who sat alongside team president Theo Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer during the fall 2011 news conference introducing them as the Cubs’ new front-office regime.|1

When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher, only the deepest, most corrosive cynicism is possible. Trampling on one's enemies isn't an exercise in moral courage. On the contrary, it's a calculated act designed to humiliate and discredit the enemy. What is the purpose of life? For some, it's a way to fill the void left behind when we die. Others see it as a quest to understand God or to bring meaning and purpose back into the world. But for many people, there are deeper meanings to life.|0

A pair of districts in the Midwest will add Muslim women to the ranks of the US Congress for the first time, CNN has projected. Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party’s nominee, will secure their respective seats in strongly Democratic districts following primary victories earlier this year that effectively decided their races. Omar, in addition to being one of the first Muslim women in Congress, will also be the first Somali-American member. She came to the US more than two decades ago as a refugee. Tlaib actually campaigned with Omar ahead of the latter’s primary race earlier this year.|1

Although there’s long been a debate over the accuracy of health information online, many U.S. Internet users aren’t hesitant to use the Web when they want answers to health-related questions.

A new study out tonight from the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project says that 72 percent of U.S. Internet users have gone online in the past year specifically for health-related information, and 77 percent of that group says their research started at Google, Bing or another general search engine.|1
