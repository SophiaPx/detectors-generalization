Known as a “ floating fest , ” Lake Wylie Music Fest has performers on land at a private residence, while musicians stay afloat on boats around the lake and a few nearby islands. As the sun rises on Saturday, it’s time for music lovers to get wet. The fest is a five-hour journey, but once you get there you won't want to leave. Lake Wylie is located on the eastern shore of the Winyah Bay in the southeastern part of North Carolina. While some people might say this area is far from the ocean, it's really just an inlet.|0
ARSENE WENGER last night confessed he passed up the chance to buy Didier Drogba – for just £100,000! The Arsenal boss could have landed the super striker seven years ago, while he was playing for lowly French outfit Le Mans in the French Second Division. But Wenger stressed he was not the only manager to snub a player who went on to join today’s FA Cup semi-final opponents Chelsea for £24m two years later. “Don’t forget all the French clubs watched him,” he pointed out. “Nobody took him. He went from Le Mans to Guingamp.|1
Although state trademark registration offers fewer benefits than trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office , state trademarks may provide additional benefits to your business. State trademarks allow you to claim your business name in the name of a state or the United States, rather than nationally. In addition to the additional name protection offered by state trademark registration, state marks also provide some additional advantages. You may register your state trademark with the State of California, as well as the state trademark registrar for any of the other 50 states. State trademarks also provide international protection when used in foreign countries.|0

If you can't find figs, layer the cream and the crunch here onto whichever fruits are in season. We happen to have a line on super-fresh figs – from the elementary school down the street from us. If you don't know any third-graders tending to some fig trees, however, layer the cream and the crunch here onto whichever fruits are in season; apples and pears now, berries later.

"John Bennett(July 20), a teacher at Westside Middle School, was upset by the School Board's decision to have teachers teach all sides of any controversy. He is right, of course, that pretending all sides of any controversy are equally valid is nonsense. But a good deal of the issue hinges on our definition of ""teaching"" a position. If ""teaching"" means that the teacher merely presents all sides of a controversy as though they were equal in weight and legitimacy, then we are being equal time indoctrinists."|1

In a modest one-room space sublet from the Live Worms art gallery on upper Grant Street, the museum uses letters, videos, books and photographs to tell the story of the writers known as the Beats."|1
To any objective observer, the consensus that exists between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the fundamental issues of war and peace, Wall Street’s dominance of American life, and fiscal austerity, has been made crystal clear in the two “debates.” In the absence of effective popular resistance to the duopoly of money, the economic and social crisis fails to create a corresponding political crisis for the rulers. As a result, there is nothing important for them to debate. The two titans of America’s finance capitalist duopoly clashed – leaving behind a dull fart.|1

Women who work in the White House do earn equal pay. Another right-made-up fact. The Republicans with their 12 percent approval rating, don’t you wonder who are the 12 percent that think the people driving the clown car are doing a good job?

The new law finishes old business in Trenton and expands the so-called Tuition Equality Act , which let qualified immigrants in New Jersey go to state colleges and universities tuition-free. New Jersey has finally done it. The Republican-led Legislature and Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy have just signed into law a bill that would eliminate private college tuition in the state. Private college tuition is expensive. The average yearly tuition at a four-year public school in New Jersey is $11,200, according to the College Board.

ROBIN VAN PERSIE may still leave Manchester United this summer, but it won't be for Qatari side Lekhwiya according to general secretary Adnan Ali. Van Persie's United future remains up in the air with reports suggesting the Dutch striker could be sold this summer. Louis van Gaal refused to clarify Van Persie's future over the weekend, leading to further speculation that the former Arsenal man could be on his way. There's no truth in the news. It had been claimed that Lekhwiya - currently coached by former Swansea boss Michael Laudrup - had put together a £6m-a-year package to lure Van Persie to Qatar.|1

"This week, in a closed-door meeting of Congressional Democrats with President Obama, Representative Ed Perlmutter of Colorado bluntly said what has been on many politicians' minds: ""Larry Summers. Bad choice."" Mr. Obama was visibly annoyed and mounted a defense of Mr. Summers, his former economic policy adviser who also served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Summers, who the president said had become something of a ""progressive whipping boy,"" appears to be a strong contender to succeed Ben S. Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve."|1
German scientists working on the Wendelstein 7-X fusion device started a series of experiments that could eventually prove the superiority of inertial-confinement fusion over other fusors, such as the traditional tokamak, which have been the focus of most fusion research for years. The Wendelstein 7-X team has managed to sustain fusion at the high temperature necessary to make fusion practical for energy production for over five minutes. This achievement is far beyond what previous teams have been able to do, and may lead to a new, more efficient method of generating energy from nuclear fusion.|0

The U.S. government is charging that Google is systematically paying women less than their male counterparts . Testifying in a lawsuit filed in July, a Google vice president said that it’s the company’s “policy and practice to compensate employees based on their level in the organization.” Those with more experience get paid more, he claimed, and Google doesn’t keep data that would allow it to determine salary ranges based on gender. But the way Google pays its workers is a little more complex than that. In April 2015, Gizmodo reporter Mat Honan wrote that Google had developed a new salary-adjustment policy.|0

"(CNN) — Portuguese sailors called it the ""Gates of Hell."" Namibia's Bushmen speak of the land God made in anger. From the air, the bleak shoreline of the Skeleton Coast looks wonderful -- a deep green sea, fringed with surf, breaks over a shore receding into infinite dunes. From land, it's a different story. The Benguela Current rushes in, urgent and strong, hurtling the chilling Atlantic into the fierce heat of the Namib. Whale and seal skeletons from the former whaling industry still litter the coastline -- the source of the region's frightening name."|1
New Jersey hits day three of its government shutdown Monday over a budget stalemate that's closed state parks — and will likely force the furlough of 35,000 workers.

Or the one that takes an ample amount of sick days, but managed the strength to go to the football game. What about the person who’s otherwise brilliant, but bends company policies to her will–and is promoted? We’ve all told white lies in life, and at work.|1
On April 22, 2014, Hollingsworth was supposed to drop off 20-month-old Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth at a child-care center about 7:30 a.m. But he “forgot her in the car,” according to an arrest warrant affidavit filed by a North Richland Hills police investigator. “This is a disabled veteran who had several things on his mind that day and just forgot,” Lex Johnston of Hurst, Hollingsworth’s attorney, said Tuesday. Johnston said Hollingsworth’s daughter and four children were living with him, and he took the daughter to work, paid for child care and drove the grandchildren to day care or school.|1
Last week, we learned that the Obama administration is considering other alternatives to stop foreclosures. Today, we have some color on what one of these efforts might look like. It would encourage servicers to reduce struggling borrowers' mortgage balance. Although banks have fought such efforts in the past, it seems that the program could benefit everyone involved. And the best part: it wouldn't take any taxpayer dollars. Of the residential mortgage-backed securities outstanding, about $1.3 trillion are so-called private label notes that were issued by banks and other financial institutions, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.|1
To any objective observer , the consensus that exists between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the fundamental issues of America's foreign policy is not one based on any deep understanding of the actual foreign policy of the United States. On the contrary, the views of Romney and Obama on many of the most important areas of U.S. international relations are strikingly at odds, and the divergence in their positions is growing. The debate over whether or not to extend the Bush-era tax cuts -- which are scheduled to end Dec. 31 -- was the latest manifestation of the deepening rift between the two candidates.|0
Many Alberta small-business owners, who have been struggling through a prolonged economic downturn, are hoping the next provincial government will bring relief through business-friendly policies. The Alberta election is April 16 and polls suggest that Rachel Notley’s ruling New Democrats will be replaced with Jason Kenney’s United Conservatives, which have campaigned to scrap the carbon tax and loosen some labour rules that have driven up business costs. Over the past two years, small-business confidence in Alberta has reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the country, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which has been tracking the measure for about 20 years.|1

Millions of refugees have fled their homes in war-torn Syria since 2011 . President Barack Obama previously planned to resettle a mere 10,000 Syrians . Now, he is proposing to welcome in as many as 100,000 — and even to expand the resettlement program, if Congress approves it. But even though the president has pledged that those who are admitted won’t be considered refugees, the program will still face some of the same scrutiny and criticism it endured after last year’s program, which admitted about 1,600 Syrians in a matter of weeks. Some of these criticisms have been legitimate, but others are exaggerated or misleading.|0

Back in those days it was called ""alternative route."" The wisdom was to place an extremely green teacher in a high-need school with a mentor and let them learn on the job rather than with a traditional program."|1

Thirty years later, Mission of Burma still sounds like the future. Mission of Burma is a band with a lot to offer acolytes of cool post-punk minimalism who prefer a little anthemic arena rock and musical invention with their explorations of modern sterility. The Boston trio of Roger Miller, Clint Conley, and Peter Prescott brought exuberance and lyricism to their noise rock, producing only one full-length studio album before disbanding in 1983. Producer Martin Swope added the tape effects that lend the band its dreamlike, blurred-around-the-edges sound."|1
There is broad agreement that moving patient records into the computer age is essential to improving care and curbing costs, but the widespread adoption of this trend is hampered by the challenge of integrating a patient\'s electronic medical record into an individual\'s primary care workflow.

Last week, Germany's Africa Commissioner Gunter Nooke said that European countries should be allowed to lease land and to build and run cities in Africa as a means of stemming what he views as the unchecked expansion of migration from Africa to Europe.

So I started to play the game a little differently, to see what I could do.|0

""The ECA is the most successful piece of industrial relations legislation in New Zealand's history and attempts by the Secretary of the Engineers Union, to brand it as a failure are laughable"", said Mr Bradford. ""The success of the ECA sticks in the throat of Unions, because it has delivered what they couldn't: more jobs and higher wages.  industrial disputes have fallen to their lowest level since 1935."|1
In December 2013, INSYS received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which notified the company of the commencement of an investigation by the DOJ’s Civil Division into the company’s sales and commercial practices and resulted in the company’s corresponding public disclosure. As is often the case, this four-and-a-half-year investigation has been conducted in concert with certain whistleblower litigation that was filed under seal prior to and during the course of the DOJ’s investigation.|1
Syrian sources said April 14 that the Jordanian charge d'affaires in Lebanon, Hisham Moheisen, who was kidnapped from his residence Feb. 6, had been released in the Lebanese resort town of Shtoura. Monitor Mideast correspondent John Yemma reports that there was no immediate Western or Jordanian confirmation of this development. But several Lebanese media sources reported that Mr. Moheisen had been found -- one saying he was picked up by the Syrian Arab Deterrent Force near the besieged town of Zahle. Jordan has blamed Syria for the abduction. The two countries have had severely strained relations for almost six months and nearly went to war late last year.|1

BOB Cole died yesterday. Around 2pm in a purpose-built flat on a Swiss industrial estate outside Zurich, he said goodbye to his friends, and went to sleep for the last time. He was 68, terminally ill, and was taking his life into his own hands, as around 30 Britons do each year at the Dignitas. His wife, Pam, was one of them. She was suffering from progressive supernuclear palsy, a fatal brain disease, and faced a terrible death. In February last year she died as Chris de Burgh’s Here is Your Paradise played at her bedside.|1

The Switzerland-based company behind the Regus and Spaces brand said it was looking to revive its UK operations, which has been hit by a weak property market in London and higher costs related to opening of new sites.

"Q. What was your favorite Christmas gift you got as a kid? A. ""Man, I don’t know if I even remember like a specific gift. I got a smartphone when I was a senior in college. That’s the one I remember, pretty recent. So I had a flip phone all through college. I don’t know if that’s my favorite, though. That’s just the one that I remember because it was kind of a big change for me to go from a flip phone to a smart phone."|1
The word hero gets thrown around so much that its use has lost much of the intended impact. Indie filmmaker Denise Ohio restores a bit of the word’s luster with this surprisingly compelling portrait of Frank Minden. Who? An ordinary, hard-working man, a WWII vet and master diesel machinist, the 76-year-old Minden has never signed a multimillion-dollar contract with a sports franchise or refused an Oscar in honor of the worthy cause of the day. But in the short space of thirty minutes, Ohio illustrates what makes this St. Louis man so admired and respected by those around him.|1
New Delhi : The ruling Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) , or CPM , is prepared for a confrontation with the BJP in Kerala if the state goes to polls in the fourth week of the ongoing panchayat election. It has deployed all its forces to the hilt to mobilise votes, including in the districts of Kollam, Kannur , Kasaragod , Kozhikode , Pathanamthitta and Kasargod , the CPM said. The party’s strategy, as the CPM leader told The Wire , has been to use the election as a referendum on the government’s performance in Kerala, with a focus on development and law and order.|0
Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “ Thank You ” rally was the crowd ’ s response to “ God bless you ”. Everyone was on their feet applauding, and “ God bless you ” was the only thing they seemed to be saying. That’s not because they didn’t know the words, but because the crowd didn’t care about those words. Those were the words that came from their mouths, and what they said with those mouths had no connection whatsoever to the spirit of the song or the words themselves.|0

It didn't have the highest success rate when it came to matches this season, with only Melissa Walsh and John Robertson still together. But the lack of relationships continuing after Married At First Sight hasn't deterred unlucky in love singles, with Channel Nine confirming they have received a record number of applications for next year's season.

"Sanday , a Scottish island inhabited by only six people , has just got its first road – an unpaved track – that leads from its pier to the tiny village of Dunnet Head and the surrounding coast. But the first road on a Scottish island isn't something to celebrate, it’s something to be wary of …

The whole of Sanday is one big expanse of peat. It’s the highest island in the United Kingdom, is covered in moorland, has a handful of low-lying houses on its western flank, a handful on the southern coast and then nothing for thousands of square miles."|0

Under Trump , presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor . Since discovering this, I have been thinking about pardoning Trump. I’ve talked to many other people about this, and all of us who think that Trump has done things wrong that would lead us to vote for Clinton if we could vote, find ourselves thinking, if we were in a position to pardon him: If we had our way, we would do it. We all know that, if we were in a position to pardon him for all the things he has done wrong, we would.|0
The AKP should take comfort in its large majority and start to view minority views and even peaceful dissent benignly. The outcome of Turkey's latest general election - voters have gone to the polls twice in the last five months - reveals important insights into the nature of the country's democracy and the preferences of its citizens. The first of Turkey's two parliamentary elections this year, in June, was widely viewed as a referendum on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's efforts to strengthen the powers of his office. The result was clear.|1

Peter Brimelow writes : On November 21 , 2008 , I spoke in Baltimore at the inaugural meeting of the Baltimore Patriot’s Corner, which is part of a loose network of patriots, libertarians, and classical liberals who are attempting to re-emphasize the original principles of American political philosophy.

The meeting has been quite successful. I thank all of you who have come.|0
It's not your imagination—but you should blame the candidates, not the media. The father in question has voiced similar complaints. “I think it’s a big mistake; this constant four-year, peripatetic campaign is not good for America. We need to deal with the business we have before us,” Bill Clinton told CNN in December. Of course, neither Clinton is a particularly reliable narrator here, because it’s the third member of the Clinton clan who is responsible for much of the ink that has been spilled about an election still more than two and a half years away.|1

Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child’s play, thanks to MIT. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a parser that imitates kids’ learning processes by observing the environment and making connections. The system studies captioned videos and learns to associate words with objects and actions. When given a new sentence, the parser can accurately predict its meaning—without visual clues. This “weakly supervised” approach, which requires limited training input, could expand the types of data and reduce the effort needed for training parsers. Annotations can certainly speed up the process, but they’re not needed to learn.|1
"In a small way, we made history. Last Saturday, an ad hoc group of citizens interested in improving an aspect of public policy sat down informally with the civil servants responsible and designed a web service to do the job. In all, it took less than five hours. The event was a barcamp held by the National Archives as part of its response to the Cabinet Office's ""government 2.0"" report, the Power of Information (PDF at tinyurl.com/2umfpb). What's a barcamp? Dude, you've obviously been out of the loop for the past, ooh, seven weeks."|1
The future leadership of Volkswagen hangs in the balance today as the 20-member board of the troubled and iconic company meets to decide critical issues including who the next CEO will be in the wake of Martin Winterkorn‘s resignation earlier this week and how deep the cuts must go into the ranks of executives held responsible — along with the action plan to win back the trust of shocked customers and government regulators. Meanwhile, other top-level action continues as European regulators begin delving into VW’s emissions behaviors and as 27 state attorneys general in the United States develop a potential criminal case against the German automaker.|1

The first image of Earth from lunar orbit . Before an Apollo-era NASA could launch a few humans on top-secret missions to the Moon, it had to figure out how to actually get a few men off the planet. Here's what that meant... It's a picture so breathtakingly beautiful and breathtakingly weird, that it has inspired many a poem and song. It is a picture of Earth as seen from Moon orbit on the night of March 17, 1969. The Moon was at perigee — its furthest north of orbit.|0

It was a bountiful year for books in English by Quebec writers. Ian McGillis looks back at some of his favourites. Putting together a Lucky 13 piece on 2016’s best books in English by Quebec writers, the thought recurs that there were years, not so long ago, when getting a list up to this count could be a challenge.

For Bruce Logan , microbes are an electrifying subject . The Kappe professor of environmental engineering at Pennsylvania State University , Logan works with microbiologists around the globe on projects that range from understanding how microbes live and reproduce to discovering how to control the growth and health of plants. In recent years, his team has studied how biofilms, the masses of single-celled organisms that colonize our bodies, interact with electricity.

Jill McGown, who has died aged 59 from cancer, was one of the generation of crime writers who shifted the genre firmly into the contemporary world. Although she held fast to the traditional skill of well-crafted plots, she brought a modern perspective to characters and situations, creating a series of thoughtful and engaging police procedurals. She will be best remembered for the 13 novels featuring Chief Inspector Danny Lloyd and Sergeant Judy Hill. Theirs was a relationship that encompassed the personal as well as the professional, and Jill's deft handling of its development was one of the keynote elements of the books.|1
If you live along the Eastern Seaboard and wake up early Friday you could be treated to a colorful sky.

As a result, the satellite's orbit will slowly shift northward. If you're lucky enough to be able to spot the passing satellite from the East Coast, it will be a spectacular sight with the sun gleaming off its solar panels.|0

Some Zimbabwe government supporters say President Robert Mugabe should form a government without the opposition, following an opposition boycott of talks Monday in Swaziland. Tendai Maphosa asked ordinary Zimbabweans in Harare what they think about this latest threat to the power-sharing deal signed last month and reports for VOA. After failing to agree on the allocation of Cabinet posts last week, Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change decided to refer the matter to the Southern African Development Community. They agreed to meet with SADC representatives earlier this week, but that meeting never took place.|1

Although there’s long been a debate over the accuracy of health information online, many U.S. Internet users aren’t hesitant to use the Web when they want answers to health-related questions. And rather than dedicated health sites, the vast majority of them begin their research at a search engine.

Fast bowler Matt Hobden has been tipped for a bright future as he bids to bounce back from one of the darkest days in his fledgling career. Hobden’s encouraging start to the season came to a grinding halt in the previous Championship match against Middlesex at Hove. The 22-year-old from Eastbourne lost his rhythm completely as he committed 11 no-balls in 16 overs in the first innings and another three in the second. His struggles were highlighted by an injury to Ajmal Shahzad on the opening day which prevented skipper Ed Joyce from withdrawing him from the attack.|1

What a strange twist of fate. I have a very strong memory of meeting the man for the very first time in early 2007. He was then, as he is now, wearing a very nice black suit and a very nice red tie.|0

In recent years, platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their artistry. For the generation of designers who grew up playing “Super Mario Bros.” platformers offer a sound formula. Though the goal of such games is usually to get from one area to the next, that framework supports copious possibilities. Determining how a character moves through a world and what sorts of things should impede or assist in the process allows plenty of room for creativity. It is why games like “Journey” and “Inside” can both be constructed around jumping avatars but otherwise appear quite distinct.|1

A Manitoba woman has been sent to prison for hiding the remains of six infants in a rented storage locker, but court never heard an explanation as to what prompted her to hide the babies she conceived over many years. Andrea Giesbrecht, 43, bit her lip and looked straight ahead, but showed little emotion as she was sentenced Friday to 8 1/2 years. Provincial court Judge Murray Thompson said Giesbrecht’s moral culpability was extreme and the sentence needed to be strong enough to denounce her behaviour. “These were newly delivered infants, our most vulnerable,” Thompson said in his decision that was livestreamed by Winnipeg media.|1

The pardoning spree continued on Tuesday, as Trump issued two more before jetting off to Europe to stomp all over NATO, this time clearing the names of father-son arsonist duo Dwight and Steven Hammond, Oregon cattle ranchers whose 2016 fight against the federal government became a conservative cause célèbre.|1

A CoinDash employee who saw the attempted hack called police and was able to contact the alleged attacker via CoinDash's Discord chat service before police responded.|0
On the Web: For site addresses and a map of the tour, check out www.littlespokanestudios.com. Spokane and Spokane Valley have something to boast about; a stunning river that flows through like a vein, its banks ripe with history where men and women settled to benefit from the flowing abundance. Now a metropolis, the area often forgets the river; its sound lost to traffic. Still, it flows with the help of three major tributaries: Chamokane Creek, Hangman Creek and the Little Spokane River. The participating artists will display their wares at five locations within minutes of each other and the river.|1
"PROGRAMMING ALERT: Ivanka Trump will appear on “Fox & Friends” at 7 a.m. ET for an exclusive interview. Republicans on Sunday urged President Trump to clear the air on whether he has tapes of private conversations with former FBI Director James Comey and provide them to Congress if he does. ""I don&apos;t understand why the president just doesn&apos;t clear this matter up once and for all,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a member of the Senate Intelligence committee. She added that she would support a subpoena for the tapes if needed."|1
Barack Obama ’ s presidency has coincided with immense growth of social media services like Facebook and Twitter . And that in turn, has increased the popularity of social media tools that are designed for political use. In an era in which most of our news and political news comes from our social networks, people are becoming more politically aware. For many people, Facebook and other social media are now the first, and sometimes the only way they get their news. And, they’re using it in a way that’s changing the way information flows.|0
Considering all the comings and goings of people involved in the project , we should be grateful that Bohemian Rhapsody is still on its path to cinema. We have no idea where the film would have taken had it been cancelled by the board of 20th Century Fox over the weekend. What is known is that the movie was being re-written and is now scheduled to hit theaters on November 16th 2019. The movie is currently scheduled to hit the big screen in the U.K. first on October 12th 2019 and then will go on to other major territories.|0

The five-storied 'Farhad Mansion' resembles any other well-maintained house in an affluent neighbourhood of Chittagong city. Yet no gatekeeper guards any of the two steel gates that lead to the small front yard and the stairway of the building. With the summer holidays, it is not surprising that the ground and fourth floors that house an English medium school are deserted. But even the residential second and third floors show no signs of life. Climbing to the top, the locked grilled-gate to the roof is reached. Standing there, one cannot help but shudder, imagining what had happened there on April 27, 2012.|1

"It takes a community to help migrant workers who need affordable medical care and social assistance. This is the belief of Dr Goh Wei Leong, co-founder of HealthServe, which has grown from strength to strength and marks the 10th anniversary of its first clinic this year. ""Its not just about dishing out medicine. It's about the human community. (In the early days), I realised we needed social workers, counsellors and legal advisory."" The non-governmental organisation has dental and medical clinics in Geylang, Mandai and Jurong catering to migrant workers. It also provides social assistance to those in distress."|1
Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the hard work required to maintain it. Amid the hubbub of shopping centers and the din of traffic from nearby Hwy. 61, the cemetery sandwiched between McDonald's and Tires Plus seems jarringly out of place. Few pause to notice the prim patch of well-tended green, bounded by an iron fence, that holds some of Cottage Grove's earliest pioneers. The cemetery, designated a historic site by the Washington County Historical Society, has ties to the founders of Mars Inc., the giant candy manufacturing company.|1
Fish oil . Protein shakes . Vitamin D pills . The packages look alike . Does it matter which you buy? Or should I just not buy any at all and go with an all-natural, whole food diet which will make me a healthy, vibrant, radiant, radiant young woman? Please advice me. You really don’t need a supplement, especially since you eat plenty of fish and chicken. Vitamin D is naturally produced when the sun hits the skin, so that should be sufficient for you. I highly recommend the book “How Not to Die,” by Dr. Michael Greger.|0
In the greatest debate since the color of the dress, people are arguing over what color these pills are. The dress debate blew up online, with some people claiming it was white and gold while others thought it was blue and black. The reason was pegged as linked to how one’s retinas function. Now everyone is arguing over the color of these pills, in a picture widely circulated online over Twitter, Facebook, and other websites. The photo shows two hands holding a pill each, with one hand colored yellow and the other blue.|1

Weather Underground on the Weather Channel : Highly gender-normative interactions . The lady sits behind the bar when the men are at a table in the back watching football and drinking beer, and when the guys are watching sports or playing arcade games and drinking beer, they get up to get more refills. I would guess a lot of women would feel left out of those interactions, though, because they’d have to interrupt them to get some attention. So why are all the tables in the back occupied by guys when there are no girls?|0

During their relationship, Marla reportedly found out about Ivana and Trump's relationship.|0
To most NBA experts , players and fans , Kobe Bryant is one of the top 20 best players of all time. However, I have my doubts. In fact, my biggest concerns about the former Los Angeles Lakers star center is this: If there was a better player out there who could score as well or better than Kobe, would you rather have him be your teammate? Would you want Kobe Bryant as your team’s franchise player? First, a disclaimer: Kobe Bryant’s greatest skill is scoring the ball.|0
The J. C. Penney Company, the fourth-largest United States retailer, said today that September sales at stores open at least a year were falling short of expectations, prompting several analysts to cut fiscal third-quarter earnings estimates. Warm weather and consumer concerns about the decline in United States stock markets hurt sales of clothes, notebooks and other back-to- school products, retailer analysts said. J. C. Penney's same-store sales may decline as much as 5 percent this month, they said. The company's goal was to increase sales as much as 4 percent.|1

So far, eight people were injured, one of whom is in a serious condition."|0
The Jewish-American advocacy group J Street, which bills itself as the dovish alternative to the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) lobby, has secretly received funding from billionaire George Soros despite previous denials that it accepted funds from the Hungarian-born financier and liberal political activist. Tax forms obtained by The Washington Times reveal that Mr. Soros and his two children, Jonathan and Andrea Soros, contributed a total $245,000 to J Street from one Manhattan address in New York during the fiscal year from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009.|1

So, what’s next after all of the early NBA free agency buzz? Nothing like what’s happened so far, one would think. Unless Kawhi Leonard gets dealt, we’re waiting on a bunch of restricted free agents and whether or not they will stay put or sign offer sheets elsewhere. That list includes Houston’s Clint Capela, one of the premier centres in the league who surely will stick in Texas, Chicago’s Zach LaVine, who was one of the key pieces in last years Jimmy Butler trade, Boston guard Marcus Smart, Portland centre Jusuf Nurkic and former No.|1
Selkirk Avenue was closed down for several hours by a fire. At around 10 a.m. Monday, Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service crews responded to a fire in a vacant commercial building in the 400 block of Selkirk.

Officials said that the fire progressed into the roof of an attached residential-style portion of the building.

Chipolo Plus is supposedly the loudest Bluetooth item tracker available today, and its chirpy tune can be heard from a greater distance than other similar trackers. Thanks to some useful new tech, items gone missing around the house or office can announce their locations with chirpy ditties — as long as they have Bluetooth trackers attached and you're close enough to hear the trackers' songs. So can you tell the difference between those dB levels? In my tests, I could indeed hear Chipolo Plus a little bit better than the other trackers, though the difference is subtle.|1

Iqbal Survé’s Sagarmatha Technologies, which failed to list on the JSE a year ago, has set its sights on an offshore listing, according to Survé’s newspaper Business Report. Sagarmatha, a technology company within the Sekunjalo investment group, has already made an application to the SA Reserve Bank, the publication said, citing Survé, the chair of Independent Media. In early 2018, Sagarmatha’s listing on the JSE — along with a mooted listing in New York — was scuppered by its failure to submit financial statements on time.|1

Steve Norris is former Conservative transport minister. Britain can reasonably claim to have invented the railway. Stephenson’s Rocket represented the pinnacle of British industrial-era innovation. The ability to move products and people by steam locomotion had a transformative effect on society. British ingenuity saw railways knit communities together across the country, and eventually the globe. And for the next couple of centuries, little changed. The same techniques are being used to maintain track now that were used in Stephenson’s time."|1

COLOGNE CATHEDRAL SWITCHED off its light last night, in protest at the weekly anti-Islam rallies happening in Dresden. The symbolic act came as thousands of Germans demonstrated in Cologne and several other cities against the ongoing protests by the group calling itself Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West. PEGIDA attracted its biggest crowd yet in Dresden yesterday – more than 18,000 people. Cologne Cathedral provost Norbert Feldhoff, told n-tv that shutting down the lights was an attempt to make the PEGIDA demonstrators think twice about their protest. Only about 250 PEGIDA supporters showed up in Cologne, as compared to about ten times that number of counter-demonstrators.|1
After seven seasons together with the Cubs , could the Theo Trio be on the verge of a breakup ? It is hard to imagine the Chicago Cubs without Ben Zobrist on the roster. He is the most versatile player in the National League with a variety of tools that can fit into almost any situation. On the other hand, one of Theo Epstein's three greatest accomplishments as an executive in Chicago — the three World Series titles that he brought to Wrigley Field from 2006 to 2019 — was the way he constructed his lineup in such a way that Ben Zobrist's presence was almost inevitable.|0
WASHINGTON – Congress is moving to put under military control all armed contractors operating in combat zones, a Pentagon recommendation that could run into resistance at the State Department. The Senate this month included such a requirement in its 2008 defense spending bill. Democratic Sen. Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Wednesday he is confident the House will go along with the idea and include it in a final bill sent to President George W. Bush. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was to testify about the subject Thursday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.|1
With snow falling steadily and the temperature well below freezing, Minnesota Sen.

Klobuchar, who easily won a third-term last year, is the most prominent candidate from the Midwest to enter the race. Klobuchar had worked with then Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., to help fund the new bridge and get it completed at a faster-than-usual pace.|1

For decades, aid groups have assumed they know what's best for refugees and the poor; a growing body of evidence suggests they're wrong. Both academic research and practical experience, such as with the mass of Syrians fleeing civil war, shows that simply handing out traditional relief goods may not be the most effective way of helping the dispossessed. Aid agencies are tentatively also giving away cash and letting refugees decide for themselves what they need. While the results may be unexpected, the money is being wisely spent and rarely wasted - contrary to old prejudices among donors.|1
Although there ’ s long been a debate over the accuracy of health information online , many U.S. Internet users still rely on online sources for health-related information , particularly for questions that can’t necessarily be answered elsewhere.

The Labor Department said Tuesday that America had 5.5 million job openings in September, close to the record high of 5.8 million openings set in April. There was even a small increase in federal government job openings. It's a great sign that employers want to hire. However, this huge number of openings also signals that employers can't find the workers with the right skills for the open jobs that they have.|1

Beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl is never easy. When they scored 21 points the first three times they held the ball in the second half and took a 33-32 lead, we all thought the same scary movie we’ve seen since 2001 was replaying before our eyes. But this epic brought a different ending. This one saw Foles, a man of faith who wants to be a pastor when he leaves the game, play as if touched by God. He completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.|1

The election is wide open, pitting Islamists against men who served under deposed leader Hosni Mubarak.

I have written previously about my own pets, and the most common prompt for me to do this has been when my own animals have reached the end of their lives. For me, it has been a type of grief therapy sometimes, with the opportunity to write an obituary for an animal that's been an important part of my life. This week, the good news is that this is not an obituary. One of my two cats, Couscous, has been unwell, but so far, treatment has been successful, so this is a tale about her illness, not about her death.|1
A year ago, Palos Verdes came on strong at the end of the regular season and dominated during the playoffs en route to winning the Northern Division championship. The Sea Kings are doing it again.

The battle over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ’ s new “ borrower education tool ” unveiled earlier this week by the Trump Administration has been a high-profile, high-stakes affair. The tool is not yet available to the public, but a handful of news reports and blogs have examined it and its implications. The consumer agency, created as part of the post-financial crisis Dodd–Frank legislation, has an important role in the U.S. economy and for the public, but its creation was a highly political process that included a period of bitter conflict between its Democratic supporters and Republicans who would later control Congress and the President for the next two years.|0

McALLEN — School district trustees and top officials met with the local citizens league Thursday to cover the upcoming Tax Ratification Election proposal that will more than likely be put before the board next month. The lunch meeting at the McAllen Salvation Army was one of many similar presentations planned before the board’s vote to clarify what this election is about. If approved by the board, the election, known as TRE, will ask voters to allow the district to take all 11.5 pennies from the Interest and Sinking fund, known as I&S, and move these to the Maintenance and Operations side, or M&O.|1

The eight-episode 1980s-set drama will air in the summer. Mere weeks after finishing production on the pilot and securing a series order, the cast and creators of Ryan Murphy's newest FX drama, Pose, met reporters Friday at the Television Critics Association's winter press tour where they touted the realness of the drama that explores the ball culture. Pose looks at the juxtaposition of several segments of life and society in 1980s New York: the rise of the luxury Trump-era universe, the downtown social and literary scene, and the ball culture world.|1
When Pacers coach Frank Vogel announced he would sit all five starters for last night's game against the Bucks, it was like a thought experiment come to life. Can a good team's second unit beat the starters of a historically awful team? It was close, but...yes! The game was an exciting one, if only from a theoretical standpoint: You desperately wanted to see what would happen, but not necessarily actually watch it go down. Because this wasn't Copeland and Solomon Hill and C.J. Watson getting meaningful minutes in just any late-season game—this game mattered.|1

A Houston district court judge who lost a re-election bid on Tuesday is facing criticism for releasing a majority of the campaign’s fundraising documents in the days prior to Election Day.

According to the website Texans for Public Justice, the 27th Judicial District includes Harris County, which is home to the county seat of Houston and its surrounding suburbs. The Texas Constitution requires candidates for judicial office to disclose their financial holdings and campaign donors.|0

Throwing knives at your HSC project and then dunking it in the pool isn't the usual way of checking for success, but it was a big part of Tom Denby's major work. The 17-year-old set out in year 11 to build a wetsuit that could protect scuba divers from shark bites as part of the accelerated Design and Technology class at Mosman High School. The finished product has four sleeves that go over both arms and legs, is made of aramid fabric and metal mesh wire and has been coated in black and white rubber spray to repel sharks.|1
One minute he was strutting around the end zone, staring into the stands, the look of a stone-cold killer in his eyes. The next, Golden Tate was tossing his helmet to the ground in a fit of frustration, stunned – like most everyone else in Ford Field – at what he’d just heard. The Detroit Lions had a win stolen from them in the cruelest of fashions Sunday, when Matthew Stafford appeared to throw the game-winning touchdown pass to Tate with 8 seconds left, only to have the score overturned on replay and the game ended by a mandatory 10-second clock runoff.|1
For decades , aid groups have assumed they know what 's best for refugees and the poor ; a growing chorus of voices is telling them they don't know what they are doing and need to take a good, long look at their practices and policies.

Redknapp, who lost several hundred pounds of cash and credit cards, said: “Forlan’s a good, interesting player.

Where do we begin to try to describe this restaurant? Probably the best place is first to apologize for keeping this secret to ourselves for such a long time.

After all, there are some delightful restaurants in Bratislava, and this gastronomic oasis is 140 kilometers away. Why should we encourage you to take this drive? Simply, it is a combination of the people, the food, and the service.|1
When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher, only the deepest, most corrosive cynicism is possible. Trampling on the rights of others for political advantage was the modus operandi of Adelaide's Nomenclature Committee in 1837. Western Buddhism and Pentecostalism are sometimes criticised as self-indulgent forms of religion. Is Bishop Spong's Christian humanism any different? The press coverage of Iraq’s surprise victory in the Asian Cup final was — as Ernst Bloch might have put it — full of utopian sentiment. The win was, admittedly, a remarkable achievement, but one that hardly accounted for the sheer exuberance of the outpoured emotion that followed.|1

SAVANNAH , Ga. ( AP ) — A pair of Buckeyes were doing their best to hold off a team of Savannah, Ga., football fans on the final play. With time running short, a player from the Buckeyes was in the clear. He looked down the field for an open teammate, but there was nobody there. So, he jumped up and gave it a shot. He made it. The team had scored the winning touchdown and the Buckeyes had made history as the first Georgia high school to play for a football championship on the road. The win was huge.|0
SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) - Water officials are not quite ready to declare an end to the drought-stricken state of Utah, but are hopeful the weather will be kinder from here on out, at least until next year’s spring runoff.

And even if a second drought doesn’t happen, a third could.|0

FREJUS, FRANCE—The world is in the throes of a major global financial crisis, and for France’s far-right National Front (FN) the best response is to raise its profile, even if it means associating itself with some of its more outlandish claims. The party, whose leader and presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen, is on course to win the first round of the presidential election, has used the global financial meltdown to its own advantage."|0
Running errands on your bicycle is a great way to burn calories and get some exercise. When you need something small or you are just checking prices and availability, pedaling to the store can be a pleasant experience if you can find a bicycle-friendly route. Several major shopping locations in the Rogue Valley can be accessed by bicycles without encountering excessive traffic. For example, both the Rogue Valley Mall and the Medford Shopping Center are easily accessible from the Bear Creek Greenway bicycle path. It is somewhat more difficult to ride a bike to the big-box stores along Highway 62 (Crater Lake Highway).|1

"( Reuters ) - For U.S. media companies and investors , it was the ruling of the decade . A judge in San Francisco ruled in a sweeping case that Facebook's business model violates the U.S. law that prohibits online companies from ""disseminating the names"" of people who use them to post online. The outcome is unlikely to have a sweeping impact, but it could signal a new direction in the fight over whether social media companies such as Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc can be held accountable for allowing users of their platforms to spread damaging information."|0

Media & Entertainment I write about women in the business of Hollywood. New research released today from the Geena Davis Institute on Gender and Media shows that we have a long way to go in our depictions of girls and women onscreen in family-friendly movies. It also showed that countries around the world must do a better job of employing women because, when they do, we see more women and girls onscreen. In their previous research, Dr. Stacy L. Smith, Marc Choueiti, & Dr. Katherine Pieper at the USC Annenberg School of Communications, looked at G, PG and PG-13 rated movies that were released in the US.|1
Fish oil. Protein shakes. Vitamin D pills. The packages look alike. Does it matter which you buy? It certainly does, according to Labdoor, a four-year-old, South San Francisco-based startup that tests about 50 supplements and energy drinks each month that it buys off retail shelves, then ranks for consumers. What it finds might intrigue you. Vitamin C degrades in water, for example, so any water-based Vitamin C tablets are basically worthless. More than a quarter of fish oil products are rancid on the shelves, even when their expiration date may be two years out.|1

The first image of Earth from lunar orbit. Before an Apollo-era NASA could launch a few humans on top of a rocket and plop them down on the moon, it needed to find safe places to land. So from 1966 through 1967, the space agency launched five spacecraft, which it creatively named Lunar Orbiters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Lunar Orbiter 1 was the first to swing around the moon. It automatically took film photos, processed and scanned them, then beamed the images back as radiowaves to receivers on Earth, where technicians recorded them onto analog data tapes.|1

But none of them are in football. Coach Steve Warner wants to change that on Saturday when his Crusaders travel to Salina to play in their first state title game since 1990. Buhler (12-1) faces Coffeyville in the Kansas Class 4A championship game at 1 p.m., and a week of preparation has featured a buzz in a town that is ravenous for a first-ever state football championship.|1
Where do we begin to try to describe this restaurant ? Probably the best place is first to apologize for it. We know it's a little too late for that but we still want to try. What can we say about a restaurant that has been around for over 35 years? It's very eclectic. It has been very busy from the beginning. It has served some of the best food around and has been recognized by many critics as having great food. It's always busy and has been voted the number 1 restaurant in Kansas City many times.|0

Certainly one of the most brilliant dialogues in the ballet is its pas de deux . It was danced excellently by Nacho Duato and Anna Netrebko last night (11.05.2010), but I have never been able to watch it in such a relaxed manner myself. I find it hard to just relax while watching a pas de deux, as it often seems that one part of the dancer's mind is in the other dancer, or the two are in a very deep conversation, with only half an attention on the other half of the audience. That was exactly the case when I watched Duato and Netrebko dancing.|0
Student Senators passed a resolution that would have NYU divest from three companies associated with the Israeli government and institute a boycott on Israeli goods. The motion was not approved by the university senate. Senators were divided over the motion which was passed by a vote of 15-5. The senators were split on whether there should be a university senate resolution that calls upon the university to divest, and if so, how the university should divest from companies associated with Israeli government. However, the senators passed a vote of 13-5 to call for the university to divest from Israeli arms manufacturers.|0

Who pulled the plug on the canal this time? It’s winter, and we’re certainly not in the middle of a drought, so what’s happened to this stretch of the Grand Union Canal? The Cooks Wharf area of the canal appears to have drained away again, just four months after the same section was left bereft of water. The area sits just outside Cheddington on the way to Marsworth. In August there was a similar scene after a boater left a lock gate paddle open – the gates control the flow of water in the lock.|1

Many Alberta small-business owners , who have been struggling through a prolonged economic downturn , are hoping the next provincial election will deliver them a little more of the same. That’s because for all of Premier Jason Kenney’s talk about small businesses, they still don’t know what he plans to do to boost their fortunes when the dust settles on a campaign that’s not expected to see many substantive policy announcements. It’s been nearly three years since the previous provincial government, led by the United Conservative Party, swept into power on a platform of reducing red tape and lowering taxes.|0
It's hard to imagine that 2001: A Space Odyssey would have its incredible cinematic impact without that classical soundtrack. But director Stanley Kubrick originally hired a composer to score the film, only to abandon the score in postproduction. Kubrick tapped Alex North, who had scored a number of classic films, including Kubrick's own Spartacus, to write the 2001 score. Kubrick deemed the score inadequate for the film, and replaced it with the classical musical tracks that are so familiar today. North wasn't aware of the change until the film premiered.|1

Hi, National Geographic, it's me, Ryan. I got your package today and I guess I'm wondering - why did you send me a pseudoscientific crystal healing water bottle with your name on it? National Geographic, usually known for photos of animals and the adventures of rich people visiting other countries, is premiering their Will Smith-narrated, Darren Aronofsky-produced series, One Strange Rock, on March 26.

Akshara Haasan had what you would call a dream debut in Bollywood with ‘Shamitabh’. While the 2015 film was helmed by R Balki, the debutante actress none other than Amitabh Bachchan and Tamil superstar Dhanush as her co-actors. The actress’ next outing in Bollywood was ‘Laali Ki Shaadi Mein Laaddoo Deewana’ (2017), which saw her share screen space with Vivaan Shah. Since then, Akshara has been missing in action in Hindi cinema. However, she is all set to make a comeback now, albeit not on the big screen.|1
Women who work in the White House do earn equal pay . Another right-made-up fact . The Republicans with their big mouths who claim they're pro-working woman have been fighting for equal pay since the Reagan administration in 1981 . The last time a female president was in office , in 2008 , the pay gap was even larger . The top 20% of the female income earners made on average $3 million a year , while the top 20% of the male income earner made $2.7 million a year on average . If a woman earned $100,000 a year she would be paid 95.2 cents for every dollar her husband made .|0
Promises to replace houses sold off under the Right to Buy scheme look increasingly hollow as the Government slashes council houses' sale price to a third of the cost of replacements.

The government is selling off the country's remaining council homes at lower prices than ever before despite a soaring housing market.

I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad’s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should not constantly be called to account for the vicious behaviour of IS. Still less to be stigmatised until unnamed Muslim leaders disowned it. I was disconcerted to see so many Eureka Street readers appeared to agree with the demands against which she protested. Both Ruby’s complaint and the responses to it reminded me of the attitudes taken to Catholics in an earlier generation. The popular charges against Catholics were honed in the Great War and particularly by the referenda on Conscription.|1

SUNRISE, Fla. -- The New York Rangers weren't necessarily impressed with their performance Wednesday night, but they weren't going to complain about their bounce-back effort. Two nights after being shut out by the Tampa Bay Lightning and seeing goalie Henrik Lundqvist pulled, the Rangers rebounded with a 5-2 victory against the Florida Panthers. The Rangers appeared headed for an easy victory when they led 3-0 midway through the third period, but they had to respond after Florida cut the lead to 3-2 on goals by Scottie Upshall and Nick Bjugstad less than four minutes apart.|1

With the economic noose poised to tighten around Iran over its suspect nuclear program , the Tehran regime is shaking the Western-dominated petro-dollar system, which has been in place since the 1970s. Last month, Iran successfully paid its oil-supply contracts by transferring the equivalent of US$1.4-billion in oil to China’s state-run bank, the China Development Bank (CDB), which had agreed to lend the cash for the oil supplies. In doing so, Tehran has broken the terms of its crude-oil contracts with the Western oil majors, which require buyers to pay their suppliers in dollars.|0

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi routinely lands up at the airport to receive world dignitaries. From the moment a world leader sets foot on Indian soil, Modi's photo ops begin.

When they landed in New Delhi on February 17 on the beginning of the Canadian prime minister's week-long trip to the country, the Trudeaus came out of the plane with a namaste, the traditional Indian greeting. But Modi wasn't there to receive them.|1

Will an upcoming vote in Congress signal the end of Medicare? In the next few weeks Congress will decide whether to cut $54 billion in overpayments to Medicare insurers, igniting a battle that may well determine whether the program survives. On one side are Medicare supporters, who want it to continue as a successful social insurance program. On the other is the insurance industry, which is spending millions and lobbying hard to put Medicare on a fast track to privatization, a goal long sought by fiscal conservatives and their allies in right-wing think tanks.|1

Cryptocurrencies, outside of Bitcoin, have failed to garner much attention from buyers, and while the same can be said of sellers, the digestion of losses over the past month is likely to lead to more losses soon.

Weak price action in ETH/USD has it set up to make another leg lower soon. It could continue to drift ever-so-slightly higher, but the developing bear-flag implies risk is skewed more heavily towards the downside.|1

Bavarian farmers are angry that their famous Alpine dairy cows will apparently have to wear nappies under European Union environmental rules. This is the first time that cows have had to be fitted with special underwear to avoid upsetting the delicate ecosystem on which the animals feed. If the regulation goes ahead as it is expected to, farmers could be faced with a 40 euro a day per cow cost, which would be a real burden for many small farms. The regulation could also affect the Alpine region's reputation as an important milk producing region for the EU, the biggest producer of dairy products in the region.|0

My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors. For example, consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron, or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one. Each of these cells, (if taken from the same individual) has an identical genome — and yet each is “reading” a very distinct subset of that genome and consequently carrying out very different behaviors. The choice of what to read and what to hide away is made during development.|1

Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of flaws in the way universal credit is designed, campaigners say. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG ) said arbitrary rules built in to the way universal credit is calculated leave some families unable to predict how much they will be paid each month, leaving households in debt and unable to budget. It can lead to claimants being wrongly benefit-capped – a penalty designed to “incentivise” jobless or low-earning households by severely limiting their benefits – because the system fails to spot they are working and earning enough.|1

ASTANA , Kazakhstan—Nursultan Nazarbayev , Kazakhstan ’ s first and only president , resigned on Tuesday , ending his nearly three-decade rule and opening a power vacuum. The country’s acting president has vowed to hold free elections, but observers say that the next president is likely to be chosen by an elite of insiders and the former president’s close circle. It will be Nazarbayev’s third stint as Kazakhstan’s leader, having first come to office in 1990. He stepped down in the fall of 1991 after the Soviet Union collapsed, but returned in 1994 after a constitutional amendment granted him another seven years in office.|0

Over the next few months, many federal employees will receive performance ratings. Some may believe their ratings to be unreasonably low. What can be done? There is a review process for most employees, but that process generally functions within the agency’s control (with exceptions for bargaining unit employees and successful equal employment opportunity complainants) and is often criticized as being unfriendly to complaining employees. Nonetheless, an appeal might be successful if an employee is careful, thorough and able to strike the right notes. Appeals take numerous forms. Following is a summary of different groups of employees and how the processes may differ.|1

Black Starlets coach Samuel Fabin says his side were not threatened at any point in their convincing win over India in their last game group at the ongoing U-17 FIFA World Cup. Ghana impressively saw off host nation India 4-0 in their last match of Group A at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi on Thursday. A brace from captain Eric Ayiah and substitute attackers Richard Danso and Emmanuel Toku were enough to send Ghana through to the next round as group winners.

Where will he wake up next? A prison cell? A tropical hammock? Or suspended on a cliff? It has the makings of a pretty good TV show, in the vein of Quantum Leap. Each day, a man wakes up to find himself in a different bed in a different part of the world. The experience, while clearly always disorienting, can vary dramatically based on the circumstances. Some days he’s in prison, or squatting in a storage bin. Other mornings he wakes up in a goat pen or a tropical hammock.|1

The callers are offering to register residents over the phone, and in some cases, to send the voter an absentee ballot. In Louisiana, residents cannot register to vote or request an absentee ballot by phone.|1

Eighteen years ago Monday, on June 24, 1995, South Africa’s Springbok rugby team staged a stunning upset to win the Rugby World Cup against the heavily favored New Zealand. But the game was much more than just one day’s win. This was the day Nelson Mandela cemented himself as leader of all South Africans. Elected the year before, democracy was still fragile and the racial divide was still raw. Rugby was an all-white game and Springbok captain Francois Pienaar was its hero. But Mandela enlisted Pienaar’s helps to use this final to unite, instead of divide.|1

We chose to question the narrative of history by simply quoting words which Churchill used himself. At a glance, Blighty Café appears to be another one of those trendy and sophisticated coffee shops that offer the terribly appealing combination of tasteful beverages, off-beat music and the inviting aroma of freshly-baked sourdough bread. As a university student living in the area, of course, I couldn’t resist. Sounds perfect, right? Except, sitting in the mock air-raid shelter, drinking my flat white, I couldn’t help but feel ever more uncomfortable.|1

Four detection stations throughout the Large Hadron Collider will help gather huge amounts of information about what happens during each collision, possibly revealing new information about the basic makeup of the universe. Today was perhaps the most exciting day in a more than a decade for scientists and science lovers around the world.

Rather than corresponding to a massive, cosmic event, today’s news focused on the sub-atomic level.|1

Until further guidance is issued, USCIS is temporarily applying interim procedures to H-1B non-profit entity petitions filed with the agency seeking an exemption from the statutory H-1B numerical cap based on an affiliation with or relation to an institution of higher education, an official announcement said. Effective immediately, during this interim period USCIS will give deference to prior determinations made since June 6, 2006, that a non-profit entity is related to or affiliated with an institution of higher education – absent any significant change in circumstances or clear error in the prior adjudication – and, therefore, exempt from the H-1B statutory cap.|1
“Overwatch” was pristine out of the box. The character and level design were excellent. It combined elements of hits “Team Fortress 2” and “League of Legends” to create something completely new. But for a multiplayer game to have any longevity, it needs to consistently improve and add new content. 20 millionBlizzard announced in October that “Overwatch” had hit 20 million players in its first five months. “Overwatch” took a step back in late June when it unveiled a deeply flawed competitive mode, but it rallied the following month.|1

The “digital workforce” may sound like science fiction, conjuring up images of lines of robots running through an office. In truth, the digital workforce is a tangible reality. But, rather than teams of robots, it involves a more promising environment with people, automation, and artificial intelligence working side by side. This hybrid workforce is coming to life thanks to businesses that recognize the transformative potential in automation and AI. In a study by Genpact of 300 C-suite and senior executives, 79% of AI leaders – the companies generating impact from AI – expect their employees to be comfortable working alongside robots by 2020.|1
The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep. That is the provocative implication of recent research that examined investors’ financial risk-taking following periods when their sleep was disrupted. I concede that advice to get more sleep is hardly new, since we’ve been hearing that most of our lives — and the advice is honored more in the breach than in the observance. Furthermore, retirees typically would like to sleep more, but can’t — due to the disruptions in sleep patterns that are a normal part of the aging process.|1
Throwing knives at your HSC project and then dunking it in the pool is n't the usual way of checking whether or not it is done. It's far more common for you to have to check that it works properly in order for it to be finished. I'm sure you're right that you didn't really mean it that way. In the first place I don't recall ever throwing any knives, not only did I not think of doing so when I was in the throes of the exam but I also don't remember ever throwing knives during the exam.|0

In recent years , platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their technical prowess. While most of today’s games are more realistic and grounded in reality, it is refreshing and invigorating to play a game that has no qualms about throwing you off of ledges and having you die multiple times in the first minute of gameplay. Some of my favorites include Super Meat Boy, Braid, and Hotline Miami. Most platformers follow the “Run and jump” gameplay mechanic, where you must jump in order to traverse to the next section of the level and avoid obstacles.|0

"The right sheet set and pajamas can help you stay cool. Today’s memory-foam mattresses don't sleep as ""hot"" as older models did, thanks to air-circulating layers and ventilated toppers that keep the foam from absorbing and retaining all your body heat.

If your memory foam mattress leaves you sweating at night, a few remedies can help turn down the heat -- if only by a few degrees. Anything you can do to distance your body from the memory foam will help keep you cool."|1

Although state trademark registration offers fewer benefits than trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, state trademark registration can be a cheap alternative for securing limited trademark rights. Federal trademark registration can run anywhere from several hundred dollars to $3,000, depending on the type of mark being registered and the amount of attorney's fees. On the other hand, many states charge less than $100 to file a trademark application. Keep in mind that state registration will not offer multi-state protection, nationwide priority status, incontestability, a presumption of validity or the ability to file a trademark on an intent to use basis.|1

So the latest Star Wars game has made tea-bagging Darth Vader ’ s smug Jedi son ’ s face an iconic moment for the franchise. I know the game was released a year ago, but there have been enough recent developments that I thought it was a good time to update my review. The most notable change: I can now play the game at home. For the past year, I’ve had to spend $200 on the game every time I played it. Why did it take a year to get a home version of the game?|0

LOS ANGELES ( AP ) — The Oscars are adding a new category to honor popular films and promising a new era of diversity at this year's 91st annual ceremony. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said Saturday that it's adding a best documentary feature category for films released in 2019.

The change comes after the Academy decided to award the best picture prize for a documentary as a separate honor from the Oscar for best feature-length picture.|0
While the SP-BSP-RLD alliance may disrupt the caste math in many pockets , the Congress is relegated to the role of junior partner. In the past, whenever the Congress had been on the verge of forming a government, all its rivals – the BSP, SP and the LDP – would be forced to ally with it. In fact, when the Congress formed government at the Centre, it is the LNP that had to take on the role of the BSP-SPs’ junior ally. This time around, Congress may not get the chance to form a government at the Centre.|0

The decision on 15 December 2005 in the case of Jones v Garnett was a victory for the taxpayer and a blow for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The case concerned a husband and wife, Geoff and Diana Jones, and their company, Arctic Systems, which was set up in 1992. In common with family businesses' tax planning and on the advice of their accountants, one share was issued to Mrs Jones and one share to Mr Jones.

The Scimitar-horned Oryx no longer lives in the African desert . It is considered extinct in the wild . But the animal continues to survive . And thrive . And even reproduce , in the wilds of Israel, in zoos . And even on farms. So why is Israel the last place to see this endangered species? In the mid 1980s, an Israeli-American conservationist named Uri Avnery decided that if the world could not stop the extinction of a species, the least it could do is help save it. So he decided to create a program to help save the Scimitar-horned Oryx .|0
Timeshare management companies foreclose on homeowners who do not pay the bill . 1 Can I Be Sued for Not Paying a Bill? No. Only a mortgage loan holder can sue someone for breach of contract if they don't pay their mortgage payments.

Sunkett said the running back positions are still up from grabs and that the ground attack will be by committee, at least early in season. A young East St. Louis defensive unit gave up a lot of points a year ago. With three starters returning on the defensive line, a group of strong and quick linebackers and a secondary, which will be led by Thomas, the Flyers should be better this fall. Gone up front is all-American defensive end Terry Beckner Jr . — now at the University of Missouri — but LaMontre’ Harvey, Antuan Quinlin and Terres Lagrome, are quick agile linemen who return.|1

It 's hard to imagine that 2001 : A Space Odyssey would have its incredible cinematic impact without that classical soundtrack composed by Vangelis. That's what I want to talk about in this article and you'll discover how it's done. How is the soundtrack made ? To compose a soundtrack for 2001, it was like writing a new chapter for a story that Vangelis always wanted to tell since the 70's. The story of 2001 is not only about a voyage into space and an adventure, it's also about an intellectual and philosophic adventure.|0
You have to give Square Enix points for honesty ; Bravely Default : For the Sequel wears its primary intentions so clearly on the sleeves of its clothing, and not one bit more than that. It’s exactly what you would expect the next iteration of a game bearing the title of “sequel” and based upon an already established game would be. That’s not to say that it doesn’t look like the most visually impressive RPG of 2014. Quite the contrary, as this game really looks like a visual leap forward from what we’ve seen previously with the series.|0
Currently a team of 15 based in Bangalore, ConfirmTkt has had a significant increase in traction over the past one year with 20-30% increase every month. “Waiting list” is one term that every IRCTC user hates to hear. Booking a waiting list ticket not just makes a journey unpredictable but also causes huge inconvenience to the traveller. Making situations worst, there hasn’t been a feasible solution to the unpredictability of ‘Waiting List’ for ages, resulting in last minute cancellation of plan. It was a few such experiences that sparked the idea of ConfirmTkt in Sripad and Dinesh Kotha.|1
Damn, aside from Tom Tykwer desperately trying to get out of there at the 30 minute mark, and their publicist throwing out a bit of a burn towards DP at the very end, it was a great interview.

Amazing interview…I wish I had the chance to catch the late screening with Q&A at Fantastic Fest…Profound love/respect/admiration to the Wachowskis, Tykwer, and you David.

The Pentagon report recommends that the armed forces ""establish a legal framework for contractors"" operating in combat zones in Iraq.

For Wrexham this was their sixth cup final in a row, having lost on all six previous occasions.|0

Let ’ s dispense with the question of whether Democrat Ralph Northam is being treated unfairly . His grievous political sins are well documented . But the questions raised by his apparent involvement in child pornography are worthy of consideration . And it is important not to fall into the trap of using his alleged offense to explain his poor performance as Virginia’s lieutenant governor. There is far too much evidence that his poor performance as Virginia’s lieutenant governor is his own doing. Northam is not a child pornographer . No doubt about it . And if this were all he did , this would be an interesting and revealing scandal .|0

What Steve Lonegan can teach Republicans about making life hell for Democrats. New Jersey Senate candidate Steve Lonegan may not beat Cory Booker, but his run offers some interesting lessons for Republicans. I’m betting that the candidate with the poll lead, higher favorables, and more experienced campaign team will, indeed, win, but I’m interested in how the race has become a test kitchen for attacks on liberals. Steve Lonegan, Booker’s opponent, is running his third statewide campaign, his first as a nominee.|1
Oh , how the mighty ’ do has fallen ! Disgraced former senator and presidential candidate John Edwards , reviled by nearly the entire country as a liar, has been sentenced to more than 2 ½ years in prison for violating campaign finance law by funneling illegal campaign donations to his mistress and having them paid for by a wealthy supporter. But even as Edwards’ supporters have celebrated the end of a political career that seemed destined for the history books, a troubling question lingers: How could an apparently honest man, a pillar of the Democratic Party, become such an unrepentant fraud?|0
Against the odds, Auburn Smith, 16, has become a nationally ranked wheelchair tennis player. She will participate in the USTA-ITF Junior Wheelchair Tennis Camp. PORT ORANGE — Auburn Smith was born into sports.

Jack Kerouac cruised the bohemian North Beach neighborhood here in the 1950s intent on achieving nothing less than freedom of thought in his work, but it’s a bit of a myth that he spent most of his time at the St. Mark’s Hotel and writing feverishly. “If I didn’t have the job, I wouldn’t be able to write.” This was the explanation offered by Jack Kerouac to those who questioned why, despite being a writer and being famous, he still had a job.

A jaunt through October's art highlights. Eighty-eight-year-old Jack McLarty has had a distinguished career, with an exhibition history stretching back to the 1940s and artworks housed in collections such as the Smithsonian Institution's. His paintings this month at Broderick show evidence of his fascination with Central and South America. A riot of tropicalia, The Garden of Good and Evil is all parrots, crucifixes, Dia de los Muertos skulls and anacondas wrapped around naked women's legs. The best of McLarty's works have a kooky exuberance, executed with a neo-Impressionist technique and a folk artist's naivetÉ.|1
"The storm we're bracing for is the type of January variety everyone prepares for: monitor school closings, check flashlights and stock up on bread, eggs and milk. It's hard to know exactly how any storm will hit until it actually arrives. But there's a foreboding sense about what to expect in the coming days. ""We had something comparable in January 2014,"" said Aaron Reynolds, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Buffalo. That storm launched Buffalo's first official blizzard in 21 years at the time."|1
How will fuel prices and driving in Europe be affected by Brexit?

Driving abroad will also change, with drivers having to display a GB sign with the potential of a fine for those that don’t.|1
Should Bikes Be Allowed On Muni Metro ? A recent news report on an injured cyclist denied passage on the Muni Metro for wearing a helmet made us think a little more on this issue. We recently wrote here about the dangers of riding on San Francisco's streets, including the risk of being involved in a traffic accident. There is no question that the city is dangerous for bike riding. However, we would like to point out that riding on sidewalks or on the edges of the road are equally, if not more dangerous.|0

Other events add to the excitement. They, too, are a lot of work. But they add up to a great feeling of celebration that gives us a moment to reflect on the things we love about our country. The huge water balloon fight that one Richland neighborhood organizes is a fun reminder that we are all in this together. We suspect that a great many of us don't know our neighbors well. People are more likely to have friends on Facebook who may live on the other side of the country than friends on their street.|1

The movement is a global phenomenon – but here it has stalled before even getting started. RIDESHARING SERVICES WHICH supporters claim could spare Irish cities from gridlock are being effectively locked out of the country on the grounds of breaking taxi laws. Transport officials have recently questioned one of the industry’s newest entrants, a carpooling app backed by entrepreneur and Dragon’s Den investor Sean O’Sullivan, on how it fits within rules that have already seen similar operators abandon the market.

Gotham is dealing a familiar Joker in Season 2 . Seemingly confirming what the Fox drama ’ s showrunner Bruno Heller teased at Comic-Con , TVLine has learned exclusively that the character will not be a villain, at least for the first two seasons.

Most people have heard of Scrooge, even if they have never read A Christmas Carol or any other work of Charles Dickens, writes Adrian Hattrell. What is certain is that they have never experienced the story in the form of a folk opera, which is what was presented to Tickhill Music Society by the group calling itself Green Matthews and Guest – which comprised of Chris Green, Sophie Matthews and Jude Rees. The players set the scene with a medley of Victorian carols, music hall songs and folk songs, accompanying themselves on an astonishing range of period instruments, which were variously blown, plucked and squeezed.|1
"This article was published 28/8/2009 (3522 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current. THE virtuosity of musicianship and variety of material in this amazing four-disc box set should persuade anyone of the British folk-rocker's high place in the pantheon. Thompson's 40-year career has had three distinct periods. He spent five years leading the English folk band Fairport Convention, then a decade as half a duo with his then-wife Linda Thompson. For the past 20 years, he has worked solo. Thompson was ""boxed"" once before in the early SSRq90s on a collection of out-takes and obscurities."|1
The Scimitar-horned Oryx no longer lives in the African desert. It is considered extinct in the wild. But this lovely-looking Ungulate hasn’t been completely wiped out because they can still be found at zoos around the world.

Add in birds, fish, reptiles and other living creatures, that number rises to nearly 1200. That’s why the work of organizations like the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute – or SCBI – is so crucial.|1

MANCHESTER UNITED outcast Morgan Schneiderlin has emerged as a January target for Inter Milan, according to reports. Schneiderlin has fallen down the pecking order at Manchester United under Jose Mourinho. Despite Bastian Schweinsteiger also being marginalised, Schneiderlin has been unable to force his way into the side over the likes of Paul Pogba, Ander Herrera, Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini. United are set to cut their losses on the midfielder this summer just 18 months after he signed for £24million from Southampton. And Italian website Calcio Mercato claim that Inter Milan want to bring the France international to the San Siro.|1
To most NBA experts, players and fans, Kobe Bryant is one of the top 20 best players of all time and one of the top five guards the league has ever produced. To some, he is second only to Michael Jordan and to a third, out there, group he is the best of all time. To get the first group of people to consider agreeing with the second (I leave out the third because nobody seriously believes that is ever possible), Kobe Bryant has to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a championship this season.|1
The thorny question of abortion rights is again taking center stage on Beacon Hill and putting some top officials in a tight spot. The Legislature has now passed House Bill 954, which would require all abortions to occur in a surgical center, to be staffed by a physician, and to take place within a specific time frame of 24 weeks into gestation, as well as to provide “women with medically accurate and unbiased information” on abortion. It’s expected that Senate leaders will bring the legislation up for a vote as soon as they get a better sense of how the House is likely to act on it.|0
"The “ digital workforce ” may sound like science fiction , conjuring up images of lines of robots running through an industrial assembly line . But the term is becoming increasingly relevant , as advances in information technology, artificial intelligence and data analytics are reshaping the labor market in a way that may redefine the notion of a modern “jobs.”

In fact , we are living through a period when the term “jobs” may need to be rethought . If a traditional job is defined by a certain number of hours a given person works, “digital workers ” may never clock in at a traditional workplace at all."|0

There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams's performances that could, roughly, be called his American and British sides. On the American side, there was the slushy tendency towards sentimentality, for which he became increasingly known, which, at its best, resulted in Dead Poets Society, The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire, and, at its worst, became Patch Adams and Old Dogs. Hollywood has long had a tendency to adopt the finest and most interesting comedians and then determinedly blunt the hard edges that make them interesting. Along with Richard Pryor, Williams was the most obvious example of that.|1

Most people have heard of Scrooge , even if they have never read A Christmas Carol or any other work from Dickens. Scrooge, however, is a character created by Charles Dickens, whose name, like most of Dickens's characters, is now synonymous with the English language.

It is impossible to imagine the world of nineteenth-century London without the existence of Dickens and his novels.|0

ASTANA, Kazakhstan—Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s first and only president, resigned on Tuesday, ending his nearly 30-year reign and setting the stage for an opaque succession process in the oil-rich Central Asian country of 18 million people. As his speech hinted, Nazarbayev’s departure from office will not mean giving up the reins of power. The aging leader, who has led Kazakhstan since 1989, when it was still part of the Soviet Union, said that Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the speaker of the Senate and a trusted political ally of Nazarbayev, will take over as acting president until new elections are held in 2020.|1
Doing business in British Columbia is particularly challenging because of the province ’ s reputation as a hotbed of environmental extremists. This is not just the province of environmentalists who have decided to do what they can to slow down the growth of the economy and increase the number of regulations. Many business owners, who are trying to do business in the province with a minimum of fuss, face challenges and threats. One of the most serious threats is being a victim of harassment and intimidation from the government and environmental groups, which are intent on forcing the businesses to follow their rules.|0
Fast bowler Matt Hobden has been tipped for a bright future as he bids to bounce back from one of his worst Ashes series. Hobden, 26, returned to Australia's Test team this summer but was hit with a stress fracture in his back which kept him out of all three matches before the series began. It was the third time that the right-armer, who debuted against South Africa in 2010, has had a problem of this ilk and he will be hoping that this is the final time he suffers a bout of bad luck.|0

WASHINGTON — House Democrats on Friday unveiled a comprehensive elections and ethics reform package that targets what they call a “culture of corruption in Washington” and aims to reduce the role of money in politics. The bill, among the first to be considered as Democrats take control of the House after eight years, would make it easier for citizens to register and vote, tighten election security and require presidents to disclose their tax returns. Dubbed the “For the People Act,” the legislation marks an effort by Democrats to set a tone of good government as they take the majority following historic gains in the midterm elections.|1

"For three turbulent centuries , the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into the hearts of English sailors. Even today, more than 100 years later, when a British man-of-war takes up station off the east coast of France, it raises not just concern, but outright fear. The British navy has been waging war with the French almost continuously for more than three decades, but for centuries they have been fighting a far more unsettling enemy. Now the British fleet has a name for the unknown creature that has plagued the country's seafarers for centuries: ""the devil-fish,"" or sea-monster."|0

An online portal aimed at ensuring that the Muslim community gets religious knowledge from recognised sources was launched yesterday by the Centre for the promotion of Urdu and Islam. It is to ensure that there are no contradictions between Shariat law and the Constitution, which is secular in character, a senior government functionary said in the backdrop of a fatwa issued by the All India Ulema Council (AIU) stating that Islamic laws were not meant for women and it was an insult to Islam and the country to make laws that are contrary to the tenets of the religion.|0

Considering all the comings and goings of people involved in the project, we should be grateful that Bohemian Rhapsody has finally landed on the big screen. Changing directors and lead actors puts a seed of doubt in minds as to how successful a film is likely to be. However, it’s a worthy biopic of Freddie Mercury, and Queen. There’s no argument that Rami Malek is great as the famed lead singer, but Ben Hardy (Roger Taylor), Gwilym Lee (Brian May) and Joseph Mazzello (John Deacon) also look and sound the part.|1

Let’s dispense with the question of whether Democrat Ralph Northam is being treated unfairly. His grievous political wounds — by Monday, virtually all Democratic Party luminaries in the state and most Democratic presidential hopefuls had called on him to resign — are self-inflicted.

Tactically, in terms of crisis management, that was the right move — own the transgression and say unambiguously that you’re sorry.|1

An injury at work left a husband and father facing a layoff. He couldn't return to the job until his hand healed from surgery, but recovery was complicated by an ongoing struggle with diabetes.

Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “Thank You” rally was the crowd’s silence when Trump mentioned that everyone should come together. The irony being that his campaign has been anything but unifying, which is why his supporters backed him. They’re tired of seeing this country’s demographics being changed, their white privilege being challenged. Unity and inclusion is far from what these people want — even after the election’s over. I left Cincinnati tired and disheveled, but perhaps mostly worried about our future.|1
"BAMAKO, Mali – The head of an ethnic Dogon militia blamed for a massacre in central Mali is denying that his fighters were involved in the gruesome attack. Youssouf Toloba also dismissed the Malian president&apos;s vow to eliminate the group, because ""he isn&apos;t the one who created it."" Human Rights Watch has said that Toloba&apos;s ethnic militia known as Dan Na Ambassagou has been implicated in scores of attacks in recent months. Suspicion immediately fell on the group when at least 134 people were slain over the weekend in an ethnic Peulh village."|1

When Pacers coach Frank Vogel announced he would sit all five starters for last night 's game against the Bucks, there was a lot of concern and speculation on who would start in the place of the Pacers ' best player, Paul George, in what would have been his final game in Milwaukee.

For three turbulent centuries, the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into the hearts of medieval Europeans. Indeed, the Viking Age, from A.D. 800-1100, was the age of the sleek, speedy longship. Without this crucial advance in ship technology, the Vikings would never have become a dominant force in medieval warfare, politics, and trade. With their invention of the longship, the Vikings spurred a literal sea change in medieval European affairs. The drekar, or dragon-headed longships, were stealthy troop-carriers.|1
Plushenko’s glorious career was finished. He had hoped to cap it at home after a comeback from spinal surgery, which he did, partially, by helping Russia win the team competition. But his 31-year-old back, after all those years of wrenching revolutions and hard landings, gave out two nights too soon. In essence, Plushenko sacrificed his chance at another individual medal to put his country on top. He was a longshot for gold, but in a sport of sequins and stuffed animals, he brought pugnacious sizzle. He was the James Cagney of the ice.|1

Boulder has sued the fossil fuel companies. Probably 15 percent or so of us would be alive today without fossil fuels since without them we would be living in the Middle Ages without medicines, electricity, real sanitation, etc. Those of us who did not die in childbirth or by an infection caused by a scratch could enjoy living a short life behind an animal pulling a wooden plow. Maybe it would be best if we recognize that fossil fuels had their role, evolve our power supplies to renewable, storable resources, and stop demonizing everyone.|1

It has seemed for a while as though the global financial storm was going to deal a mostly glancing blow to the technology industry. Everybody hurts when markets go into free fall (and, as we're writing this on Wednesday afternoon, the Dow Jones has just closed down another 189 points -- although, as always, it could be up 500 points again by the time you read this). But if Wall Street and the banking sector are having a tornado rip through their gilded trailer parks, tech has, thus far, mostly just experienced some rain and a few gusts of wind in its relatively quiet suburb.|1
Labour leader Ed Miliband doesn't have an image problem, he has a policy problem. The problem is he doesn't have any, or at least policies that answer the gravity of the situation. Millions of people suffer as inflation outstrips wages. The cost of food, transport, fuel and housing skyrocket. A million people have visited food banks. This is not only a joyless recovery, for the vast majority of people it's a moneyless one. A smirking George Osborne may don a hi-vis jacket and march through building sites in Northern England to boast of recovery.|1

In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don’t report to presidents. In Russia, things are different.

In 2000, when Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency, he consolidated competing power centers — media, business, local government, opposition parties and the Parliament — under his authority. He called it “a vertical of power.” This system now includes organized crime and cybercriminals.|1

BAGHDAD -- The Iraqi government launched an investigation yesterday into the apparent torture of detainees in a secret Interior Ministry jail after the US military found 173 prisoners inside who appeared to have been abused, Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari said. It was the first time that the country's US-backed government installed in April had acknowledged the possible abuse of prisoners at one of its facilities. The detainees appeared to have been mostly Sunni Arabs, a group that has long contended that Shi'ite Muslim militias close to the political parties that dominate Iraq's ruling coalition are carrying out a shadowy campaign of vendettas against perceived political and sectarian foes.|1

The team that brought you driverless cars and Siri is now fighting a new kind of war on information. In the world of internet memes, Instagram filters, and Photoshop, seeing is no longer believing. Everyone is a photographer or videographer once they have a smartphone in their hands, which often comes equipped with alteration tools already installed.

WASHINGTON — Thousands of commuters across the region were delayed Thursday morning by an apparent work action by Metro’s largest union.

Millions of refugees have fled their homes in war-torn Syria since 2011 . President Barack Obama previously planned to resettle 10,000 over the next year. But following the massive terror attacks in Paris over the weekend where at least 129 died, many governors and legislators — mostly Republicans — have called for Obama to rethink the resettlement strategy. Delaware is one of at least nine states to openly welcome the idea of refugees, despite an avalanche of largely Republican governors opposing. According to a count by Vox , 25 governors have said they would bar admission of Syrian refugees to their states and 15 governors said they still support resettlement in their states.|1

"Crucially though, these guys don't stop at food production. While their commercial services seem to focus on landscaping and food production planning for now, the team is also involved in research on designing low impact, low energy, resilient structures that can withstand future shocks—be they natural storms and other challenges, or man-made disasters such as peak oil. Based out of a purpose-built multi-purpose dwelling at the research farm, Whole Systems Design clearly puts an emphasis on low tech, appropriate and ""passively survivable"" sustainability features, by which they mean systems that can keep operating if there is an interruption of power supply or other crucial resources."|1

This will also apply to all life insurers that have completed 10 years. Irdai said firms that have already exceeded these criteria must list within three years from the date when the guidelines are issued.|1

Yet no one would have ever dreamt that the house with the modest appearance is the place where a former minister of Bangladesh's first elected government spent over a year of his life. Founded in 1952 as part of a plan to bring political representation to the people of East Pakistan, the Bangladesh National Party was elected to power following a landslide victory over the Awami League. The Awami League won a majority of the seats in East Pakistan, but not in the national parliament.|0
