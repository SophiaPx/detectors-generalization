"Girls Like Biology, Boys Like Physics? We all have our stereotypes about which subjects appeal more to girls or boys. Well, in perusing a new report on the Advanced Placement program, I was intrigued to discover some hard data to help shed light on the matter.

When George Orwell wrote â€œ1984â€ he included a vision of the future in which people would converse in a language called. Orwell described Newspeak as “the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year”. Orwellâ€™s idea with Newspeak was to have a world where all shades of meaning were removed from language, which reinforced the total dominance of the State. Calling something one thing when itâ€™s the exact opposite also might be an example of Orwellian Newspeak, like calling a bill full of spending on liberal social programs an economic stimulus plan.|1

"Trisha Pollard believes the Texas social services system relies too much on the courts to police Medicaid fraud and not enough on a tool placed in its hands nearly nine years ago: criminal background checks. ""It just seems like something so simple,"" Pollard said Tuesday. ""People in other walks of life are routinely put through background checks."" The 52-year-old retired attorney stumbled across the issue last fall when she served as a Harris County grand jury forewoman. During her term, Pollard and fellow grand jurors returned indictments against two Medicaid providers, each of whom had a criminal past that included involvement in Medicaid fraud."|1
Tech execs discuss the impact automation technologies are having on their organisations. For many organisations and their workers, technology automation is an opportunity and a threat. On one hand, using robotic process automation and other tools creates efficiencies by automating manual and repetitive tasks. On the other, it has the potential to make jobs redundant. Tech execs gathered at roundtable events in Sydney and Melbourne recently to discuss the impact automation technologies are having on their organisations. A key issue raised during the discussion was the challenge of ensuring governance policies and procedures are followed as ‘bots’ replace tasks carried out by humans across the business.|1

With the economy beginning to stall, Ben Bernanke's war on the nation's savers rolls on. A few of these funds even pay juicy double-digit yields — like the one my Permanent Wealth Investor subscribers have earned 20% on in two years. Dividend harvest funds: These funds buy shares in companies that are about to pay a dividend, and then sell the stock after the dividend is paid. By doing this, they can rotate through companies with different payment dates, and thereby achieve a high dividend payout. The problem is that shares generally trade lower after a dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend.|1

A search for ‘toxic mold’ will result in hundreds of scary warnings and ‘studies,’ but few are based in science—and many are motivated by profit. Recently a patient of mine was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well documented, but he adamantly denied that anyone had warned him to avoid alcohol. An initial confession of “a few drinks” turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact.|1
It 's safe to say Cleveland Browns cornerback and ASU alum Damarious Randall was n't expecting a response like this from ASU fans after making his initial comments on social media following his team' s 20-17 over the Arizona Cardinals at University Stadium last Sunday. His tweet was innocuous enough, thanking all the ASU and Sun Devil fans that came out to watch. But that's not all Randall said. He followed it up with a series of videos. One of those videos shows a group of women walking through the stadium and asking fans about what they think of the Cardinals' chances.|0
WASHINGTON — South Florida has long been a laboratory for some of the nation’s roughest politics, with techniques like phantom candidates created by political rivals to siphon off votes from their opponents, or so-called boleteras hired to illegally fill out stacks of absentee ballots on behalf of elderly or disabled voters. But there was never anything quite like the 2016 election campaign, when a handful of Democratic House candidates became targets of a Russian influence operation that made thousands of pages of documents stolen by hackers from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington available to Florida reporters and bloggers.|1

The overstuffed roster for X-Men : Days of Future Past just got a little bit smaller . Although Anna Paquin was originally on board for the project, it looks like her character of Rogue will be left out of Fox's mutant ensemble epic.

Plus, Paquin has only had a couple of brief cameos in the X-Men films to this point, so her absence from the next installment wouldn't be all that shocking anyway.|0

First, we looked at which major brands cost the most to maintain over the first 10 years of a car's life. We grouped all years of all models by brand to compute their average cost by brand.

German imports lead the list by a fair margin, which isn't too surprising. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners on at least $10,000 over ten years compared to a BMW.|1

"Will Chelsea switch gears vs. Arsenal? Judging by his body language, you would never think Chelsea is only two points off the top of the Premier League table. After an extra-time defeat to Sunderland in Tuesday’s Capital One Cup quarterfinal, Jose Mourinho cut a bedraggled figure, a strange mixture of irritability, weariness and defiance. ""We may have to take a step back in order to be more consistent at the back,” he said. “It’s something I don’t want to do, to play more counterattacking, but I’m giving it serious thought."|1

Can you put a price on faith? That is the question churchgoers are asking as the tradition of tithing -- giving 10% of your income to the church -- is increasingly challenged. Opponents of tithing say it is a misreading of the Bible, a practice created by man, not God. They say they should be free to donate whatever amount they choose, and they are arguing with pastors, writing letters and quitting congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teaching and rejected what has been a favored form of fund raising for decades.|1

The foremost name among all such group is that of Bajrang Dal whose activist burnt alive, an Australian missionary, Graham Staines, along with his two young sons in Orissa in 1999.

Part two of Naomi Klein's report on the events that triggered a momentous new kind of politics in Argentina. Up until quite recently, Argentina pursued a policy of official amnesia when it came to the crimes of the Dirty War. Sure, the human rights non-governmental organisations still issued numerous scathing reports, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo still marched and the children of disappeared parents still showed up, from time to time, outside the homes of ex-military figures to throw red paint. But before the Argentinazo, most middle-class Argentinians regarded such actions as macabre rituals from a bygone era.|1
She’d grown up in a predominantly white, working class housing estate. “We were the only black people, and I was called racist names on a regular basis,” she recalls. “In bed, I would pray and ask to be taught to teach the children to be kind to me and others. “This then drew me to having a ‘rainbow of friends’ — Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Rastafarian and Christian.

The centerpiece of the rebuild is the warehouse, which was constructed in 1943, according to the date scrawled in concrete. It is made of wood. The roof leaks. There is no air conditioning, let alone a cold-storage unit for fresh fruits and vegetables. The warehouse should have been leveled years ago. But those at Poverello House trudged on, as they always have, doing a lot with very little. When it rains, it pours inside. The extreme temperatures spoil our food.

ZAMBOANGA CITY—Terror is stalking residents of the island town of Pata in Sulu and it’s not coming from extremists, but politicians.

to go on for years? According to analyses by Net experts, the mass-mailing MyDoom worm, which began propagating yesterday, is the fastest-spreading software virus to date with an effect that could linger for years. MyDoom, which is also know as Novarg and Mimail.R, began spreading over the Internet yesterday. It now accounts for one of every 12 e-mails traveling through cyberspace worldwide, CNet News reported.

Guess what? The NBA really is a showbiz affair. Only super-producer David Stern isn’t pulling all the behind-the-curtain strings (otherwise, New York somehow would have won the draft lottery). To the contrary, the league lurches along in the manner of an over-budget, out-of-control Hollywood spectacular — propelled by the ego of big-money players, rife with jaw-dropping plot twists, subject to endless rewrites. And to think: We haven’t even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers. Regrettably, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball.|1

The life of the mind puzzles poets and neuroscientists who go about mapping it and labeling it, and, in my case, trying to find it. Thought itself is something to ponder in the Irish tradition and so, there are lots of concepts in the Irish language involving the mind, dreaming, and imagination. I'm only a student myself, so many of the nuances will be lost on me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear native speakers offer more sophisticated thoughts on the vocabulary of Irish thought.|1

For a passenger on an aircraft with 168 seats, the number of passengers in the plane represents 2.4% of the U.S. population.

The fourth episode of Aaron Sorkin ’ s The Newsroom is called “ I ’ ll Try to Fix You. ” I’m sure Sorkin is aware of the irony in the episode ’ s title, and I ’ m also sure he has no idea that he ’ s trying to fix the problems plaguing his show. Sorkin’s show-runner approach has always been one that works in his favor — he knows how he wants his characters to behave, what lines to write for them to say, and, as the series progresses, he gets better at understanding how to make his characters feel authentic to their surroundings.|0

The response to the bombs by the crowd at the finish line was , I think , exemplary . Sure there was some panic and confusion and disorder but there were a large number of cool headed people helping people to find safety. People went to help people that had been hurt.

The main task of North Korea 's junior minister for re-information is to refute everything ever said by French intellectuals, or by anyone else, against Kim Il-sung, his father. This is because the cult of his father and grandfather is central to North Korea 's claim to legitimacy, so that to criticize them is seen as an existential threat to the regime and the state. To put it into context: this junior minister of North Korea, who has an honorific title, would be equivalent to a UK junior government minister, or a US presidential aide. It's an important job.|0

The life of the mind puzzles poets and neuroscientists who go about mapping it and labeling it , and , like the mind, is a shape-shifter. From the moment we are born, our mind begins to grow. At first it consists of only a few neural cells, each a miniscule dot in a vast expanse of the brain. By our early 30s, however, it is estimated to consist of roughly 100 billion brain cells. As we get older, more cells are added, and connections are forged between them and between different regions of the brain.|0

That may sound like a strange thing to say about a neighboring community, but it's common in this one: Jacobson lives within the confines of a gated Jewish community in the northern Dallas suburb of Plano . There's an unwritten rule here: Don't jump on the lawn and shout ""USA"" after midnight, or after Shabbat is over, or when your neighbors are sleeping."|0

Vodafone Hutchison Australia ( VHA ) chief Iñaki Berroeta has sought to temper expectations about the imminent rise of 5G in Australia, warning customers not to expect the next iteration of mobile broadband to deliver 10-times faster download speeds than 4G. While VHA will roll out 5G at some stage – Berroeta promised it would be in the “next 12 months” – it would be at a pace that is more evolution than revolution, the executive said. “It’s going to be much more measured than we did in 3G or 4G because 5G is going to be different,” he said at a recent analyst function.|0
The best element of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film, Split - and one of the few things it did right - happened at the very end. The brief, surprising reveal of Bruce Willis reprising his David Dunn character from Unbreakable created a shared universe that Shyamalan was all-too-eager to exploit. Unfortunately, there's a wide gulf between teasing fans with a momentary appearance and building a story around it.

Multiple bills at the New Jersey statehouse are of interest to truckers and others using roadways throughout the state. Repeat drunk driving offenders could soon face harsher penalties for their actions. New Jersey law now limits punishment for affected offenders to a traffic offense. Bail typically is set at $2,500. The traffic offense designation allows drivers charged with drunken driving to continue to drive while awaiting their court date. Awaiting consideration on the Assembly floor is a bill to end that practice. Instead, A3057 would boost punishment for a person convicted of driving under the influence two times or more within 60 days to a fourth-degree crime.|1

Californians, of all people, should recognize what it means to drive people off their land. In the 1850s and 1860s, the state funded yearly expeditions that emptied entire areas of their Native American presence. But this is not only a historical phenomenon: In the West Bank, Israeli settlers and the Israeli government have attempted for decades to eradicate the small Palestinian village of Susiya. The village has existed near Hebron since at least the 19th century. In the 1980s, it was declared an archaeological site to enable settlers to move in and replace the former inhabitants.|1

In the lead up to the Super Bowl last week , NFL Hall of Famer Ladainian Tomlinson gave his projection of who he thought would take it home in the big game, and I’ll give you one guess who he picked?

Since he was a rookie in the NFL he has been nothing but supportive of Manning and all that Manning does on the field and off.|0

Forget announcing your latest album with a gigantic, budget-crippling open-air concert - Oasis have been hiring street musicians to do the heavy promo work for them. A gaggle of buskers and street performers were collected on Friday to perform new Oasis songs at various sites around Manhattan. The ragtag group included violinists, guitarists, and – we can only hope – some of those human statues covered in gold spray paint.

Want to end the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the act has metastasized into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has done much to shape the freedom of political debate in the modern U.S. What began as a vague statute that gave President Woodrow Wilson power to jail critics and censor the news media during World War I has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by policing secrets, not speech. Censorship did not end when the war did. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute.|1

Does the ‘perfect’ bourbon exist? In fact, for about 20 years, the distillery has undertaken Project Holy Grail: its systematic, clinical quest for a “perfect” whiskey. By its own account, it is close. Will this happen in late April? We can’t know for sure, since it’s all super hush-hush.

Let me explain. In the Budget, the Government announced an increase of about $15 billion in company tax over the forward estimates. It’s very important to point out that most of that increase is not new company taxation it is a write-up from under-taxed income over the past 3 years."|0
Edgar Wright has never made a bad movie. He’s never even made less than a very good movie, and so it makes sense that thus far in his career, Wright has shied away from straight-up sequels. However, that could possibly change with Baby Driver. When Shaun of the Dead was a massive hit, instead of capitalizing on that with a zombie follow-up, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost instead made a thematically connected trio of films—the Cornetto Trilogy—with the also excellent Hot Fuzz and The World’s End.|1

Van Dyke's attorneys have filed paperwork requesting he be immediately released while he appeals the conviction, according to his attorney.

DARTMOUTH — On June 14, Flag Day, the students of the James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth gathered outside to celebrate Flag Day. This in itself is not unusual, but this year it took on a more personal meaning. The reason being is that Dr. Carol Karafotis' cousin, Ted Cote from New Bedford is serving in Iraq.

The students responded and made cards that were then sent to Iraq.|1

I have just been reminded of why I quit financial journalism after 11 years in the saddle , including a stint as head of news at one of the big four Australian banks. Journalists are taught to be sceptical, questioning, thorough and uncompromised. Banks don't like that much. In a nut shell, they want good copy about them that makes their share price rise.

NEW YORK — Just before noon on Wednesday, Australian ambassador and president of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty conference, Peter Woolcott, released his final version of the global gun control agreement. Upon publication of the document, Woolcott informed delegates that they have 24 hours to confer with their respective governments and then report tomorrow for a final vote. For so many reasons, the United States delegation must choose the latter option. A few sections of the proposed agreement are provided below, each of which would require the federal government to unconstitutionally infringe upon the right of Americans to keep and bear arms as protected by the Second Amendment.|1

WASHINGTON - RFK Stadium, the once and future home of major league baseball in the nation's capital, doesn't yet look like a field of dreams. It's configured for soccer, not baseball. The field must be replaced, and the dugouts, locker rooms and press box need upgrades. On a rainy day last week, a quarter of the field was mud and tire tracks. It looked like Vince Lombardi should be coaching football here - which he once did for the Washington Redskins. But that was in 1969.|1

The Korea Offshore and Shipbuilding Association has released numbers confirming the expectations of many analysts : the number of actively employed ships in the Korean fleet fell 10% in 2018 from the previous year to 1,161 vessels. A total of 157 ships left the domestic shipbuilding industry’s fold in 2018, while 140 foreign-built vessels were included in Korea’s commercial fleet. “The number of Korean ships decreased last year on the back of a sluggish economy and increased regulations,” KOSA officials said.

Manatees are large, gray aquatic mammals. They have fat bodies — I believe that “husky” is how clothing companies would attempt to get manatees to buy big jeans — that taper to a flat, paddle-shaped tail. Average adult manatees are about 10 feet long and weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds. Manatees are among God’s ugliest creatures in the ocean, and there are a lot of strange-looking seagoing creatures. Those are facts — well, the ugly observation is an opinion, but it’s obvious enough to be fact — that I learned from the Save the Manatee Club website.|1

Drones come in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes these days , but generally speaking , most of them are powered by some form of lithium battery. These batteries are great for keeping the thing in the air for some time, but the fact that they are flammable means they can be a little bit of a hazard if they are left unattended, and especially so when you are flying them indoors. This is one of the reasons why people started to think about replacing them with a safer and more environmentally friendly option, and that is what we are going to talk about in this guide.|0

The incline bench press is a strength-training move to build your chest and fronts of the shoulders. The move is performed in a face-up position on a workout bench set at an angle. You then grasp dumbbells or a barbell in an overhand position, and extend and bend your elbows to elevate the weight over your chest. Incline chest press machines that simulate the movement in a fixed plane are another way to perform the move. The incline press is one of several exercises that help create symmetry and strength in the muscles of the upper body.|1
Washington D.C. , Jul 31 , 2018 / 03:01 pm ( ) .- The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority was in the news last year when it refused to permit a pro-life group to have a booth at a pro-life prayer breakfast.

I have just been reminded of why I quit financial journalism after 11 years in the saddle, including a spell as a Wall Street correspondent. While the world of finance had its fascinations, I grew increasingly disillusioned by the dominant narrative that it was always about the money, rather than any other considerations such as values and social impacts. They never registered on the radar. That's not altogether surprising, given the testosterone-fuelled dealing rooms and the fact there is very little connection between the decisions of City executives and their impact on ordinary peoples' lives.|1
Young African-Americans embrace computers as integral to their futures , but they may be missing out on key opportunities to learn them in school, according to a new study released yesterday by the Urban Institute. Researchers found that blacks are the least likely of any ethnic or racial group to use computers at school, and the most likely group to use them outside of school. Black students were also the group least likely to use computers for learning, despite the fact that they are far more likely to think computers are important for their academic success in the future.|0

To involve private sector in healthcare, what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to reach out to more people. The nation has a new health policy after 14 years. The long gap itself indicates the priority, or the lack thereof, accorded to a sector that is in need of some urgent attention and has deep linkages with the nation’s aspiration to grow faster and emerge as a strong economy in the global order. The new policy has proposed seven key shifts in organising healthcare services, among them a welcome change in primary care from selective to assured comprehensive care with linkages to referral hospitals.|1

A communications professor at Texas A & M University wanted to find out about the effects of changes to the newspaper. So what did he do, he asked students in a communications class to read the newspaper. The New York Times has been a mainstay among newspaper readers but like most papers has seen its readership numbers shrink. It seems the younger generations just don't read them as much as their parents and grandparents did. The professor found that younger people do read the news, they just don’t read it in print newspapers and they don’t read it on the web page of the paper either.|0
To involve private sector in healthcare , what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to provide healthcare services, as this sector is not geared up to invest in healthcare, it is already reeling from a huge loss incurred over years due to government’s policy of subsidising healthcare. The situation has worsened further with liberalisation of foreign direct investment (FDI) in healthcare in April 2012. But this is not the only solution. The government can take measures to improve healthcare by investing more in the existing health infrastructure in both the public and the private sectors.|0
He looked the part in his denim and lean muscles . Many fans feel the nickname was an unfortunate byproduct of a 5-inch height advantage in favor of one of the NBA’s greatest players ever. The 1979 NFL Draft’s 6-foot-2 running back had the reputation of being too small to play, even though he proved otherwise by finishing with the second-longest career of any player in history with over 14 yards rushing at 11,894 yards. That was enough to make the Pro Bowl four times and to put him in the Hall of Fame. “It’s a great honor.|0

New research suggests mice with induced Alzheimer ’ s-like symptoms had improved cognitive function when given a synthetic estrogen-like hormone. The results were published last week in the Journal of Neuroscience. This research is the latest in a long line of work examining the relationship between hormones and brain function in both humans and rodents. The findings of this study are interesting as they go against the grain of what has been considered to be an established body of evidence. It is widely accepted that hormone replacement therapy can cause negative side effects, such as heart disease and stroke.|0
When the theme of the convention seems to have been, “Drill, baby, drill,” which is an energy policy in exactly the same way that, “Tax, baby, tax” is a fiscal policy (i.e., it isn’t), slogans are obviously all that the party has left. Even if you think that increasing oil exploration and supply through more offshore drilling makes sense, you cannot really take these people seriously. Unfortunately, yes you can. This, by the way, was the moment when I completely gave up on the convention.|1

One of the core actions of the programme was providing poor children with free school lunches, which were purchased by the state from family farms.

Because of the productivity delivered via computer technology, the tax take for Government is surging.|1

Drones come in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes these days, but generally speaking, most of them still fall within one of two categories. There are those of the multi-rotor variety (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc), and those of the winged variety. Both categories have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor aircraft are typically more stable and easy to fly, but also much slower than wing drones that focus on forward acceleration. Conversely, winged drones can fly faster and further than their hovering counterparts, but are harder to pilot, since they can’t perform vertical takeoffs and landings.|1

Californians , of all people , should recognize what it means to drive people off their land .

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but also for that reason, an extraordinary case study for evaluating the mandate that should determine the relationship between the National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation. Ideally speaking, the national security set up anchored on Intelligence, exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security –external or internal –with the aim of neutralising it in time. At the same time, however, it does this on the authority of the elected Political Executive that is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy.|1

As a veteran of the movement to combat climate change, I have been conditioned to expect disappointment. So when, as administration coordinator for Fossil Free Stanford, I was called into the office of the senior assistant to the Stanford University president in early May, I approached the meeting with apprehension.

Last fall, Brown University flatly refused student calls to sever ties with thirteen of the dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policies at a national and international level had fared no better.|1

A local state representative is calling for fundamental reform of the state’s standardized testing system after the “litany of errors” he claims plagued the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2016. Isaac believes school districts should be able to choose from national standardized tests as the state fixes the STAAR test. When STAAR was last administered in May, issues regarding test administration, along with lost or late testing materials, glitches that erased test results, and mishandling of students’ private information have come to light, according to a press release.|1

Nobody can predict with accuracy when stock markets will end their record-setting bull run . But the best way for investors to prepare for the next crash, say experts at a new conference, is by understanding why they happened in the first place. Ever since the Great Recession of 2008, which followed a financial crisis the likes of which the world had not seen in generations, there has been a hunger for answers. How could so many of us have fallen for the hype? How could some of our most trusted financial institutions have gone bust while others took billions of our hard-earned money?|0

To a watching world, the sight of Britain on fire this week has surely been shocking. The looting and torching has revealed an inner-city London, Birmingham and Manchester seldom glimpsed in the England usually offered for export via soft-focus period dramas, Hugh Grant movies or stories on Will and Kate. If the revelation has puzzled outsiders, it has confused Britons no less. The mood here is a mixture of rage, fear and bafflement. Not that we’re not used to riots: We are. England caught fire during that other royal-wedding year, 1981.|1
VIDEO: On March 30, 2017, Atlanta drivers on I-85 north found themselves in a stunning situation when materials stored beneath the interstate overpass spanning Piedmont Road and Monroe Drive caught fire. The overpass then collapsed. Despite the 2017 I-85 bridge collapse that threw Atlanta into a two-month traffic nightmare — or the massive sinkholes that have erupted around town — Georgia infrastructure is actually among the very best in the nation. That’s according to researchers over at 24/7 Wall Street, who created an index using the share of potentially hazardous bridges, roads or dams to identify which states fare worst of all when it comes to infrastructure.|1

"Veteran congressman Jim Leach (R-IA) went down to defeat in the massacre of 2006. I'm no apologist for ""moderate Republicans"" but it is worth saying that Leach was, in my estimation, fairly clearly the best House Republican. Nevertheless, one can only be thrilled with his defeat. That it happened just goes to show how fundamentally rotten the whole GOP scene had become. Leach was, in many ways, a person possessed of genuinely decent instincts and some fundamentally sound ideas about how the United States should conduct itself in the world. Nevertheless, in practice he was useless."|1

[ Written by Jonathan Starling ] It is not unusual to read and hear complaints about the amount of trash being generated by tourists in our national parks and on our beaches. It seems that many tourists are oblivious to the impact of littering. A few years ago I wrote a blog post about the problem of sea turtles eating plastic bags and dying. The problem is compounded on some islands because there is no landfill for garbage collection. The trash has to be carried off the islands by ferry and transported to the nearest mainland landfill which can be miles away. Trash accumulates on island beaches.|0

New research suggests mice with induced Alzheimer’s-like symptoms had improved cognitive function when given a synthetic estrogen-like hormone. “This synthetic hormone improved behavior much the way that estrogen does,” said study leader Dr. Christian Pike, associate professor at the University of Southern California’s School of Gerontology. But unlike estrogen, which enlarges the uterus and is a known risk factor for endometrial and breast cancer, PPT caused no obvious changes to the animals’ reproductive tract. “This may be a promising strategy to maximize hormone therapy benefits and minimize its risk,” said Pike.|1
"The main task of North Korea's junior minister for re-information is to refute everything ever said by French intellectuals. One year he did a special on Jean-Paul Sartre and began with Sartre's assertion that ""Three o'clock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do"". As it was a drowsy Friday afternoon, the junior minister simply made a quick call and renamed his local football team 4.25 Sports Club. This made Sartre look very silly indeed, because the club play all their matches at 4.25pm. In fact every time they play, their fans chant ""Are you watching, Jean-Paul Sartre?"""|1
New Zealand ’ s Abortion Supervisory Committee is appealing a High Court judge ’ s decision that said there is nothing to stop women aborting babies up to birth under a controversial bill, reports Life Site. The court in Wellington ruled earlier this year that women could have abortions up until birth, which would allow abortionists to abort babies at the last moment of their lives in the womb. The bill does not prohibit any method of abortion. The appeal seeks to have the abortion law amended to prohibit abortions after 22 weeks gestation. This is the point when the abortionist has to use a surgical procedure to perform an abortion.|0
From M1917 to M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps are on the cusp of a centennial—the 100th anniversary of the tank in U.S. service. This animated GIF, put together by the folks at partcatalog.com, shows the evolution of the American tank—from the clanky M1917 light tank to the M1A2 Abrams—and shows how the U.S. went from a newcomer to the world of tanks to world leader. The M1917 light tank, for example, was merely a copy of the Renault FT-17. That kind of copycat engineering is an idea that would be unthinkable now.|1

Did Donald Trump Release Donald Trump’s Tax Return? For a moment, it seemed that Rachel Maddow was in possession of a genuine scoop. And then, all of a sudden, it didn’t….Thanks to MSNBC, the suggestion that Trump has “paid no taxes in 18 years” has now been definitively proven to be false. Moreover, Trump seems to have paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than did most political figures, and to have enjoyed a sizeable income to boot. Whether the report was cherry-picked we cannot possibly know.|1

Russian President Vladimir Putin called Turkey’s downing of a Russian fighter jet today (24 November) a stab in the back administered by “the accomplices of terrorists,” saying the incident would have serious consequences. Speaking in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on Tuesday before a meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah, Putin said the downed plane had been attacked inside Syria when it was 1 kilometre from the Turkish border and had come down 4 kilometres inside Syria.

The Internet has changed beyond anything could have foreseen just five years ago. It is no longer a browsing medium: it is full of Web 2.0 applications, real time communications challenges and a whole range of threats that are designed to piggy back on this new usage. As a result, Web security has changed immeasurably - it's no longer enough to block, stop or inhibit IP sessions. Web filtering cannot hope to meet the security challenge. This Webinar will explain how Internet usage has changed and how your perception of IT may not match what your users are actually doing, resulting in your security controls being by-passed.|1

The first time I heard these verses was in a small storefront church in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember because it was the same Sunday morning that Princess Diana’s tragic death was reported. I had recently left my job on Wall Street and was living in Kiev with my mother after my father had passed away and I was there because I was not having much luck in finding my way forward. I recall the wood-paneled walls of the room where I sat in the back, slightly embarrassed by the evangelical enthusiasm of my fellow expats. But when I heard these verses my wandering mind was drawn back.|1

Anyone who’s ever been frustrated at the task of shooting video in low light should be poised to freak out over Canon’s weird and amazing new camera. It’s a video camera that shoots full HD color footage in almost complete darkness. The ‘multi-purpose’ camera, dubbed only MH20F-SH, has a full-frame sensor with 2.26 megapixels. The reason for the meager resolution is because each pixel is very large—19 microns to be exact. That’s 7.5x larger than, say, the pixels found on a flagship DSLR like the Canon 1Dx.|1

A CANCER expert has hit on a way to kill tumours in two hours — using light . The technique, developed by UK scientists, could be used to kill the deadliest cancer tumours which are too aggressive to treat with surgery. It involves implanting light-producing crystals called nanoplates into tumours . The plates emit a strong beam of light which kills off the rogue cancer cells, and doctors can see exactly where they've hit. Cancer surgeon Dr Richard Graham, 52, who co-led the research from University College London (UCL), said it could be 'transformational' for treating cancer.|0

It was a situation which baffled many around the world , let alone the passengers on board the British Airways plane who had flown into Beirut. Amid the chaos which is Syria right now, Lebanon has remained largely stable and has even seen some modest economic growth, so there was no obvious reason to believe that a bomb would detonate on an international flight as it touched down at Lebanon’s international airport in Beirut, injuring at least four passengers. The reason for the bomb becoming a reality was never really clear, and now it seems it might never become clear.|0
Hull - Where the US goes the UK often follows . This is especially true of negatives . If the United States goes through a recession as it has now done for two consecutive quarters then one can guarantee that this will spread to Europe , especially the United Kingdom .

This was exacerbated of course by the oil crisis with the price of petroleum products reaching record heights .|0

"Donald Trump's tweets have long raised questions about whether they violate Twitter's rules prohibiting abusive behavior on the service. On Monday, after a Trump tweet threatened that North Korea might not ""be around much longer,"" Twitter was forced to explain why the President was not banned from the service. In a six-part tweet from Twitter's public policy account, the company said that Twitter takes ""newsworthiness"" and ""public interest"" into account when determining whether a user has violated its rules. Those considerations have long been used internally when deciding the fate of a problematic user, Twitter said."|1
January 29 , 2015 : Follow the money . One reason the new peace talks are making progress is because the Palestinian Authority is desperately short of money. It is estimated that the PA owes around $3.5 billion to private Palestinian banks, and in 2013, 13% of government spending was financed by borrowing. The PA is almost entirely dependent on foreign aid. The US provides 36% of the $3.5 billion the Palestinians receive in international assistance. In December, the US Congress approved an additional $225 million to the PA’s annual aid allocation.|0
DENVER -- During the summer of 2002, Colorado state officials were dealing with the 138,000-acre Hayman Fire while trying to let potential tourists know the state was still open for business.

This time around, the travel and tourism folks want potential visitors to know less than one-percent of public lands are impacted by wildland fires. When Owens uttered his comments, Colorado had 24 million visitors which spent about $7 billion annually. Denver had 10 million visitors who spent about $2.3 billion. In 2011, Colorado welcomed 58 million visitors who spent $10.7 billion.|1

While giant and spectacular circus shows now roam the Earth, it’s good to be reminded how they evolved from what was essentially street theatre. This Colombian acrobatic troupe, a dozen or so young performers delivering the world premiere of their latest show, are one of the main attractions of Blackpool’s now firmly-established February half-term Showzam Festival, featuring acts from around the world. Circolombia head to London after five days of performance here but nothing is ever going to quite match seeing them in the roccoco surroundings of the circus ring that nestles between the legs of Blackpool Tower.|1

Maenga is disappointed over your press release against the statement of apology from UTM president Saulos Chilima. If you think Malawi is living the past where your police lied to the country that Robert Chasowa committed suicide when in true sense your party killed him, you are mistakenly wrong. Malawi of today is not ready to tolerate nonsense. Few weeks ago when your party terrorized the nation your president Peter Mutharika failed to utter any word. Upon growing pressure the president instructed Mgeme Kalirani to craft a statement that did not address what the nation expected. Till now your government has not announced the identity of the terrorists or apprehend them.|1
THE first acknowledgement of Brent Moloney's redemption for an after-match drinking binge came midway through the season when he was quietly reinstated to the club's leadership group. The second, much more public and significant than the first, came last night when he won Melbourne's best and fairest award. Moloney, 27, claimed the Keith ''Bluey'' Truscott Trophy ahead of key defenders Jared Rivers and James Frawley at a function at Crown Palladium. Two of Moloney's midfield teammates, Nathan Jones and Jack Trengove, were fourth and fifth respectively.|1
Study suggests complex behaviors were handed down for tens of thousands of years. Despite intense scientific inquiry, there are still major gaps in our knowledge about early human life. One major question that remains unanswered: when humans were first capable of complex cognition? In other words, when did early humans develop sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as prioritization and cultural transmission, that we would recognize today? A new study in Nature addresses this; after six years of excavation, archaeologists have unearthed technologically-advanced stone tools that were created about 71,000 years ago.|1
The Bible teaches, “Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are led by various lusts (see 1 Tim.3:5-6). Many great people in God have fallen into fleshly temptations and potentially ruined their lives and ministries. One person has said, “It takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it.” This is a true saying! I believe one of the most important reasons leaders fall is that most have never intentionally set up mental and emotional firewalls.|1

When George Orwell wrote â€œ1984â€ he included a vision of the future in which people would converse in a language that strips words of their true meanings and the people of Oceania would be forced to speak Newspeak. Iâ€™ve written before about Newspeak and how it is being used in education reform. Itâ€™s the language of the test-driven reform movement, the language of accountability, the language of high-stakes testing and No Child Left Behind, the language of data-driven education, the language of the corporate reform movement. Weâ€™ve all been forced to learn it. But Iâ€™d like to talk about a more recent language weâ€™ve been hearing a lot lately.|0
Led Zeppelin stole from the ‘60s group Spirit? And did “The Voice” steal from “American Idol”? A recent court case has the estate of the composer of “Taurus” claiming “Stairway To Heaven” is in violation of copyright laws. Creatives have been borrowing from each other for centuries.

US President Donald Trump said his homeland security officials will make a plea to congressional leaders for a border wall, just hours after he threatened to skip a planned White House meeting to discuss border security. The US president is seeking to end a partial government shutdown that began on December 22, when he withheld his signature on a spending bill until it contained $5billion for his proposed southern border wall, which he argues is necessary to stop illegal immigration. The Democrats have refused to approve the money, and Mr Trump is now considering other options to fund the wall, which he promised in his 2016 election campaign.|0

The lead seal is the first found bearing the image of St. Sabas, local big shot 1,500 years ago. A rare seal from the Crusader era has been found in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Kiryat Yovel.

Despite the importance of St. Sabas — whose Syriac name is Mar Saba — to Christian history in Israel, no seals with his image had been found before.|1
"We'd also want to hide this list if we were Trump. Is his name even Trump? ""I don’t think ISIS would like Acro Cats. I don’t. They’re cute and they’re silly, two things ISIS hates.

While giant and spectacular circus shows now roam the Earth , it ’ s good to be reminded how they were born in small spaces. The circus was a popular entertainment in France during the 1770s and ’80s, but it didn’t acquire its definitive appearance until the end of this period. In the mid-1700s, two traveling showmen, Pepin and Bajat , brought a new style to their show, which was essentially a collection of comedians and trained animals. They presented themselves as “equestrian clowns,” and, in a new twist, they had the animals do tricks in order to make the public laugh.|0

South Bend (IN) -- Thursday morning, the Irish took the practice field for the final time before Saturday's Blue-Gold game. One of the biggest questions the team faced entering spring ball still has yet to be answered: who will step up at linebacker? Defensive coordinator Clark Lea said fifth-year linebacker Asmar Bilal is the closest thing the unit has to an 'absolute' at this point, but he seems ok with the uncertainty. He believes the position has made big strides over the last month and a half, but is in no rush to have everything in place with Week 1 still months away.|1

Led Zeppelin stole from the ‘ 60s group Spirit ? And did “ The Voice ” steal from “ American Idol ” ? All of this to say that the music is based on recycled ideas ( even though they may be new to your ears ). And this is where we come back to the point where I started – originality. I believe it’s all a matter of degree. As an author, I’m a great believer in taking the basic story elements and twisting them in different directions to produce an original story.

To a watching world , the sight of Britain on fire this week has surely been shocking . The looting , the arson attacks , the lawlessness .

This is a national crisis that has to be dealt with in a national way , as the rioters who are responsible for this devastation are clearly a national problem. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, was very quick to recognise the problem .|0

WASHINGTON (CN) – Republicans heaped ridicule on Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood at a Wednesday hearing after LaHood suggested that bicycling and walking are just as good ways to get around as cars. To laughter, Republican House members suggested LaHood was taking drugs, dismissed the very idea of bike lanes and derided any change to a car-dependent society. “What job is going to be created by having a bike lane?” asked Ohio Republican Steven LaTourette. He suggested that environmental sustainability projects have “stolen” $300 million from other programs and to attacked LaHood’s encouragement of bicycling, on a personal level.|1

As a veteran of the movement to combat climate change , I have been conditioned to expect disappointment . So far this year, the world has failed to reach consensus on a meaningful global plan to address climate change . Even in the U.S ., there seems to be little political will to deal effectively with climate change. In the U.S. Senate, climate-change-denying legislators have blocked efforts to enact a meaningful cap on carbon emissions , even as climate-related disasters from the Gulf oil spill to a crippling drought across much of the country have shown the urgency of the need to act .|0
The images we have published out of Yemen may be as unsettling as anything we have used before . Here's one image that has particularly stuck in my mind: A mother cradling her two children who have just died of starvation and malnutrition. I have seen photos like this before, but in my time at MSF I have never come across the images of a malnourished Yemeni child who looks like that. I've never heard of a child who has lost 44 percent of his or her bodyweight. This child looks like he is not going to make it for very much longer.|0

Syria: Why is Assad Advancing? In the Presidential elections held at the beginning of June, Assad was declared the winner with 88.7% of the vote. That is not surprising considering the nature of the regime. However, in spite of the fact that these were in no way “free” elections, and that many people could not vote as they were in refugee camps beyond the borders of the country, what emerged was that a significant section of the population is backing Assad. Why is this? Stop criminal attack on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli army embarked on a ground offensive into Gaza.|1

"Trisha Pollard believes the Texas social services system relies too much on the courts to police Medicaid fraud and not nearly enough on the agency itself.

The carrier operates 744 mainline planes that vary in size, carrying 50 to 366 passengers each. For a typical 737 plane carrying 179 passengers, the reduction would mean about 11 pounds per flight. Per the paper, stopping on-board sales of duty-free items like “perfumes, chocolates and liquor” also saved 1.4 millions of gallons of fuel annually, saving United Airlines $2.3 million. Presumably that also means United was making less than $2.3 million selling the items in-flight or calculated that allowing passengers to pick them up at ground level would not dent its revenue significantly.|1
My daughter, a resident advisor at her college, recently groaned while mentioning that she’d likely get additional foreign exchange students to supervise this fall. When I asked why that’s a bad thing, she said the foreign exchange kids tend to presume Americans are stupid unless proven otherwise.

Oh, she replied, they don’t think our colleges are stupid.|1

Without a doubt, the addiction drama “Beautiful Boy” – not the slasher-flick “Halloween” – is the most terrifying movie opening at the multiplex this weekend. Starring Steve Carell (“Foxcatcher”) and Timothee Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name”), the movie is a chilling and unsettling look at a young man’s plunge into meth addiction (and heroin, pills, pot, etc.) and a devoted father’s efforts to save him. It’s a true and horrifying story so powerful that an uninspired director and clichéd script can’t dilute its impact.|1

BASEL, Switzerland – Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG said Monday that it has had reports of 13 cases the H1N1 flu becoming resistant to Tamiflu, which it calls a very low percentage.

And the resistant variety has been like the widespread version of the virus in that it typically produces only mild symptoms. The 13 cases were scattered around the world in Europe, the United States and Asia, said Reddy.|1

"An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco today to block a California law barring any person under 21 from using tanning devices, calling it an ""unnecessary, overbroad intrusion"" into the right to privacy.

The American Academy of Dermatology, which pushed for the law's enactment, welcomed the suit, saying it shows the industry ""remains reluctant to accept its responsibility in the health and safety of consumers."""|0
Millennials are not a homogenous group of individuals, so a one-size-fits-all marcomms approach won't work. Millennials want healthy food and are willing to spend more on it. Oh wait, no – Millennials are in debt and want healthy food at affordable prices. They are also self-entitled. But they’re creative and tech-savvy, so that’s a good thing. And don’t try traditional advertising with them, stick to social media. If all of this sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a small glimpse of the countless contradicting reports on Millennials.|1

Less than two years ago, I was seated at a South Atlantic League baseball game (low A ball) between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers — Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were charting the game. As I discussed in this post, neither pitcher seemed destined to make the major leagues. Richards had been undrafted in 2015 coming out of a small college, and thus had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016 and he was pitching well for Greensboro.|1
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio isn’t visiting Israel until August. But that doesn’t mean he can’t hold hands and dance with Hasidic Jews before then.

The tide is turning at Frankston, with the Dolphins scoring successive victories for the first time in almost six years with a 13-point win over Collingwood at Victoria Park on Saturday. Coach Simon Goosey had a five-year plan to transform the competition's whipping boys into finals contenders and the results are evident. Frankston knocked off last year's grand finalist Port Melbourne last week and held off a fast-finishing Pies outfit on Saturday. The key, said Goosey, has been getting players drafted into the AFL system.

An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco today to block a California law requiring police to collect a DNA sample from anyone arrested on suspicion of a felony. The law is part of a 2004 voter initiative that gradually expanded the categories of people in the criminal justice system from whom DNA is collected with cheek swabs. The four plaintiffs are challenging a provision that went into effect in 2009 and requires the DNA sampling from all felony arrestees, regardless of whether they are ever charged or convicted of a crime.|1

The data center market in Russia continues to grow. One needs to look only at the considerable increase in commissioned facilities to find evidence of this. Consumers are no longer impressed by data centers spanning several thousand square meters, containing 1000 or more racks—these have become de rigeur. According to data provided by Datacenter Dynamics, for the last two years the Russian data-center market is ahead of India, China and Brazil in terms of total investment. Similarly, based on recent construction data from the same period, Russia places second only to Brazil from BRICS nations in terms of total area.|1

January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are making progress is because factions with responsibilities for large chunks of the population are willing to compromise if that will help stem the accelerating decline in living standards nationwide. Economic activity is shrinking and shortages increasing because of the factional fighting and especially because two governments claim to rule the entire country. Then there is all the Islamic terrorist violence. While most Libyans appreciate the help from Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Kaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become more of a menace than the Kaddafi era secret police ever were.|1

The response to the bombs by the crowd at the finish line was, I think, exemplary. Sure, many people fled from the explosions, and reasonably so. But a remarkable number ran, as they say, to the sound of the guns, even though when two bombs go off, one might well expect more. Many of these were professionals. The finish line of a marathon is a fortuitous spot to bomb, in that doctors, policemen, ambulances and so on are stationed there. Some soldiers happened to be on hand. But others were not professionals.|1

In response I expected compassion, a swell of fellow feeling. But my heart sank as I read the comments. There was so much cruelty.|1

And yet the issue of trash and waste in general is one that affects us all, touching on matters of public health, social cohesion and tourism, amongst others!|1
