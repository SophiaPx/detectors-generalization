It can also be used by developers to try to get a subsidy for providing “affordable” housing at their project, rather than providing it as a stand-alone unit in a new development."

An appeals court wo n't re-seal Cosby court documents , but seems to suggest that a federal judge was wrong to allow the public to read them, anyway. The U.S. Second Court of Appeals said a federal judge had been right to release Cosby court documents to a Pennsylvania newspaper, because the documents involved a criminal case.

I had to chuckle with cynical delight at Steve Hochman 's article about executive Jerry Greenberg and CBS Records ' refusal to play ball. It seems that in a fit of rage, Greenberg is threatening to go to the press in an attempt to humiliate CBS. He's really going for the jugular, isn't he? I wonder how long this thing will last. It seems to me that a good part of Greenberg's public relations game is to act like an arrogant prick. In the long run, it probably serves him to play a tough guy so he can keep the big bucks.

IF the earth 's temperature heats up as mainstream scientists predict it will over the next century , the average temperature of the oceans might rise by a further 2 . 2 degrees Celsius (4 . 4 degrees F ). If, however, atmospheric carbon emissions are reduced enough to stabilise global warming, then the average ocean temperature in 2100 could be only 1 . 4 degrees Celsius (3 . 3 degrees F). The question is not what this average will be, but by how much, if anything, the temperature will be above that of pre-industrial times.
Bibliophiles could be forgiven for suffering a bit of a letdown now that both the Texas Teen Book Festival and the California Book Festival have run their courses.

I’ve already written about that, and it’s a topic that’s very important to me and one of my greatest pleasures.

I’m an expert on doing business. I don’t know how you can separate them,’ Mark Carney said recently. ‘I’m happy to sit here as the bank regulator for as long as necessary.
-- A WALK TO REMEMBER : The Obama administration is preparing to publicly blame Iranian hackers for the 2013 cyberattack that briefly disabled the power grid in Vermont.

In fact, it's so bad, it's beginning to sound like a scene from a Tom Clancy novel or a movie based on one.

The recent revelations in connection with the Brexit campaign raise questions of the utmost seriousness for the functioning of our democracy. The role played by Russia in manipulating information, and its attempts to influence UK politics, is well-known. However, I believe that we must look further into the wider context in which we are now seeing this behaviour manifest itself. If we want to look at the role that Russia has played in Europe, and more recently the EU, then we need to look at the wider history of Russian involvement in Europe.

Several Mac and iOS apps distributed via the App Store have been covertly stealing user data , opening a new front in the ongoing privacy wars between developers and the public. The apps, which have been discovered by researchers from the security consultancy Lookout, can collect information about their users' devices, such as location data, and transmit that data without the users' consent to their developers, who then use the information for various purposes. Lookout has found that at least seven apps violate Apple's privacy policy—and at least two are available for download by anyone, regardless of which platform they are running.

"Automation has become an increasingly disruptive force in the labor market . Reports of robots taking over jobs through self-driving vehicles and automated grocery checkouts have become common headlines. However, many people may have underestimated the impact automation has already had on the job market. In his 2016 book, The Second Machine Age, MIT Sloan School of Management professor Andrew McAfee argued that ""the industrial era ended some time ago"" and ""our era is now the era of postindustrial automation."" His claim was supported by an increase in the number of people working in sectors that have been automated."

It 's not your imagination : Your wallet is under attack by a swarm of sneaky fees and hidden charges, costing you real money. How do they work? Hidden fees cost you real money every time you go shopping. Most of these fees can be avoided or reversed, and the best way to do that is to compare your prices with those of competitors, and choose the lowest-price option. That means you have to find and use multiple sources of pricing information to ensure that you make the best choice. That's a lot of research and comparison.

The choice is between big documents or big bureaucracies . Free trade is , in 2016 , a cause without an enemy. And the enemies are all on the other side. And I’m a conservative.

So, in a way, that’s why we’re here. We’re on the wrong side of the argument.

There is an eerie Orwellian cost to the Obama administration ’ s refusal to use the term “ War on Terrorism ”. It is a cost that is felt not so much within our government as it is by our friends, enemies and the world at large. The administration has, to say the least, made us less safe and less respected. And we are less safe because the administration wants us to fear them, to fear Muslims, and to fear anyone not like us. And they are doing it in the most insidious way possible.
A judge ’ s ruling that New Mexico has not been meeting its constitutional obligation to provide a sufficient education in public schools, and that therefore students should be educated in the private sector, was reversed by the state supreme court. The court ordered that a plan be put in place that sets out goals, timetables, and performance standards for what students should be learning and by when. This, in effect, means that the current curriculum must be changed. The court said that this will be done “over time,” and is “a necessary step” toward creating a public school system that is adequate.

This is not what I was brought up to believe in.

I looked, read, and reread those pieces for the past few days, and in the process I was able to develop some thoughts on the war, and in particular on how it came to end.

Employment has fallen so drastically because coal production has fallen by 15 percent since 2008 as companies have been forced to close hundreds of mines for lack of business.

That's the highest unemployment rate of any major industry, higher than the national average of about 5.8 percent, according to government figures.

MATTALA , Sri Lanka ( AFP ) – Sri Lanka is turning its newest international airport opening Monday into a major international trade show, highlighting its ambition to turn the country into an Asian manufacturing hub and lure more foreign investment to the island. The Sri Lankan economy has struggled since it was hit by civil war in 2009 when Tamil rebels tried to establish an independent state in the northeast of the country. The economy has recovered strongly in the last two years, but Sri Lanka is still a low-income country compared with India and China, and remains heavily reliant on imported goods and foreign investment to help grow the economy.
"U.S. policy that bans export of space technology to potential rivals is failing to halt the spread of the technology that could, someday, be used for warfare. At least that's what a recent visit to the National Reconnaissance Office's satellite factory in Chantilly, Va., made clear to the U.S. government, industry and even a few U.S. adversaries. At least five countries are developing small, maneuverable satellites that can destroy U.S. or other satellites, according to a recent congressional report. ""I'm not going to let anybody shoot down our space vehicles,"" said Bob Smith, the NRO's deputy director for operations."

"Tesla Motors reported just the second quarterly profit in its history as a public company , reversing a string of quarterly losses and sending the electric car maker’s shares up more than 10% to an all-time high. Here’s what investors should be focusing on:

Tesla’s profits and cash flow. Tesla didn’t sell any cars during the quarter, and its only major product was its powertrain. But its powertrain still generated $1.5 billion in cash during the quarter, a big reason for its strong results. Most of that cash flow is going to Tesla’s investors."

The rumour mill will be working overtime between now and the NHL 's March 4 trade deadline , and Tampa Bay Lightning center Nikita Kucherov has generated considerable chatter. The Lightning, as you might imagine, aren't in a position to do anything with the pending unrestricted free agent other than watch his value go up. The reality is that Tampa Bay has little to offer up other than cap space. In fact, there's a chance the Lightning could get worse in terms of forward depth over the next four days than they were prior to this year's trade deadline.

It ’ s time for Arlington County to conduct a comprehensive re-examination of whether to continue to install new artificial turf at its sports venues and parks. After months of study and public input, county staff recommended that the Board of Supervisors not install the fields at its nine sports complexes and four parks until it can determine the environmental impacts of grass-turf versus synthetic turf, and determine if those impacts are outweighed by the public costs of maintenance. The county also has to consider whether to pay for turf replacements at its public fields and parks when it replaces aging fields at its complex and parks with more expensive synthetic turf.

History shows that Democrats reflexively blame Republicans without proof , pretend that supporting the Tea Party is fomenting violence and riot, and even blame Republicans for 9/11. This is exactly what they are doing now and exactly why I believe that we will see more violence as the 2016 Presidential campaign moves into high gear. The left is trying desperately to paint Republicans as being racist because they have lost the debate about Obama's birth certificate, the lies they told about Obama's religion, and because they don't want Obama's policies to fail. They can't stand to see that they have lost that debate.

The Brakeman is the lead vocalist of any country-western band that does not include a full-fledged lead singer. This man is not only a singer, but is the focal point of a band's showmanship. Because the Brakeman is a lead vocalist, they are considered a solo performer."

CARABAO CUP organisers have chosen Phil Tufnell and Matt Dawson to conduct the quarter-final draw . And that decision has been made just three days prior to the event starting.

At first glance , Fox News chief news anchor Shepard Smith and his employer share an odd relationship . Nonetheless, they appear to be quite cozy, which is a problem because, as I have been explaining for some time , Fox News has become a rightwing propaganda outlet for the GOP , not a news channel . As such, Smith, who covers all things national and international for the channel , has to walk a fine line. On the one hand, as a reporter , Smith should be looking at what Fox News is doing as a news organization and not be afraid to call it out in an unbiased way.

The key is to couple slow motion with attention to the moment . The effect is to block out everything else except what is in front of you. As you move your head around to see what is behind you you will not notice that your hand is shaking and that you will need to take a drink in a bit. You do have to be aware of your surroundings though, as you can get tripped up by a falling object, or someone coming in through your door. This is not something you want, as they could hurt you.

Thanks for mentioning your thread in the PTSD forum . Folks there seem more supportive than in the thread I started. I'm glad I have a place to vent here, even though there is no point because I know I'm not going to find the answer in here, but I feel it's better to keep a record of the symptoms and what's happening rather than forget it all and let it go. I don't think anyone would have any idea of my PTSD had I not written it down, and I know I have a better grasp of things now.
Why should you set goals before investing ? Investment is a long-term activity where the investor tends to invest in large chunks. In other words, he will put some amount of money and let it grow into a large amount over a very large period of time. So, it is important to make sure that one has a good idea about how large the chunk he will invest in is going to be before investing. When one invests, he has to think about his future. If he wants a certain return, he has to think about how to earn the amount of money he wants.

It does n't mean Obama is going to lose , but the failed attempt to recall Scott Walker gives Democrats an opening to do more in Wisconsin to help the recall efforts. I suspect the Obama administration is behind the recall efforts. But there is no way to tell for certain until the recall vote. I'd bet money on the recall. The Republicans in Madison are trying to destroy themselves. If the Democrats don't win, I'd be shocked. But I'd also bet against them. The GOP in Washington is so desperate to hold onto their majority that they'll probably get what they deserve.

Should Marijuana be legalized or not ? There has been a lot of debate for decades on whether marijuana should be legalized or not. Some people believe that marijuana is beneficial to our society. But they believe that the negative aspects are too high. Marijuana and alcohol are both psychoactive substances. A lot of people feel comfortable to use marijuana instead of alcohol.

Trump said Obama didn’t call the Paris attacks an “attack” until after he took office.

If you use a main desktop PC at work or at home , and also use a laptop , you may be surprised that the performance of the machine at home or work and the performance of the machine in the hotel room or other remote locations are often very different. Most often, the performance of the remote PC is lower than the desktop PC. When you connect to a local network and use your PC from remote locations, you are connecting over a network. In order for you to connect to the network from another location, you must first be able to establish a connection to a router.
What is the first thing you would recommend I do if I want more positive energy in my home ? This is a common question.

Not just think about what to do with the living room or kitchen, but how to improve everything that you have in your home.

EVERYBODY knows that soft drinks can wreak havoc on our health ... not to mention our waistlines . And earlier this month, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a stark warning about how much sugar is in our favorite sugary beverages — and how much of it can do harm.

Rather, it is a history of people fighting for their freedom and dignity and, for those who remain in their homes, continuing to have a rich and diverse cultural heritage.

As the media tramples Parkland , it ’ s impossible not to notice we ’ ve been here before .

“ Revolutions are the locomotives of history , ” wrote Karl Marx . As the ongoing turmoil of the Middle East shows, they can also serve as the engine of human self-destructiveness. But they are not an inevitable law of nature; rather, the outcome of human choices and actions. It is hard not to compare the popular uprisings in the Middle East to the revolutions of 1917. Both events were sparked by Western intervention in the Middle East—1917 with the Russian revolution, and 2011-2013 with the Arab Spring. Moreover, the outcome of both events has had far-reaching consequences for the modern Middle East.

NATO is a popular punching bag for President Trump . Days before coming into office , he called it “obsolete” and “unfair” to American taxpayers. “I used to think we were paying to defend other countries,” he said . But “obsolete” and “unfair” are not the only criticisms of NATO that he has espoused. In recent months, the president has also made clear his view that the military alliance is an impediment to addressing America’s strategic needs at home and around the globe. It is not surprising that NATO has become fodder for Trump’s anti-establishment rhetoric.

Election coverage is an odd but predictable beast . While the electorate seeks clarity on key issues that matter to them, it can often feel like journalists and politicians alike are talking to a different audience. One of the ways to understand this is to examine how people in the United States have reacted to the recent rise of socialism in the United States and in Europe . And what we find is that there are some clear differences in the way Republicans and Democrats view socialism . The first thing to note is that the Democratic Party has not formally adopted any sort of left-wing policy platform.

Everyone is trying to build scale into their data infrastructure , but the question is : How much is enough? Scale is the holy grail of many a distributed systems researcher, but it seems to be just as elusive in enterprise environments where many organizations are struggling with their existing architectures and legacy applications, as they strive to build a modern data center. There are three main issues at play in enterprise data center architecture. First, many organizations have legacy applications built on a decade-old technology stack. Secondly, their data is usually spread across multiple sites.
After watching both hack it up for five holes , the nicest thing I can say about their golf games is that they were not the worst.

Well that's really all I can think of right now.

The FBI didn’t just go with the name, though."

The identified genes can make wheat resistant to stem rust disease , a fungus that threatens to destroy crops . Scientists have been working on developing stem rust-resistant wheat for years but have had limited success. They have also been looking for genes that make wheat resistant to stem rust but have found very few. This means that the disease has evolved to attack wheat plants that have this gene.

After you watch this dash cam horrorshow from inside an automated car wash , you will find a new appreciation for your human driving. A self-parking car wash has two modes: human and automated. And the video below, taken from a human mode car wash, shows a rather terrifying example of what happens when the person is not paying attention. The person driving the vehicle makes no effort to brake before entering the space, and he is not aware of the car in front of him, or the vehicle in back.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton got a Gaza cease-fire right at the moment hope seemed dead for a rapid end to the Israeli offensive and for a quick peace process, which was the main aim of the offensive. This was no small achievement. Indeed, at this stage, the only reason why the war is going on at all is because Secretary Clinton made an offer to negotiate with Hamas that was not rejected. This is a great accomplishment. This is not a time to be modest about it. It is a time to give Secretary Clinton the credit for the achievement.
August 02 , 2007 ( LBO ) – Sri Lanka should unilaterally liberalise its telecommunications sector even further and update the regulatory system to create an international competitive environment. This recommendation is in line with several recommendations in the “Communications Sector Reforms” published by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU-T ) in August 2005. According to the report the current regulatory regime in Sri Lanka has the effect that Sri Lanka is in a position similar to that of a “closed” economy and as such, there is no incentive to move away from the monopolistic regime, nor any reason to liberalise the sector.
How do our ideas change ? One of the biggest criticisms thrown at Jeremy Corbyn is that his left wing views have changed. They have changed, he has changed his mind on lots of things. But does that change mean his views have changed at all ? It’s a difficult question and one that will be hotly debated in the Labour Party and among the public over the coming days. I’m here to make the case that Corbyn has changed his views in many ways but has not changed his underlying views.

"There was a sound brewing in the back of guitarist John Jorgenson 's mind in the 1980s and '90s that he struggled to understand and identify. It came from his past, from his early years as a musician in San Francisco in the mid- to late-'60s. It came from a sense of purpose, which Jorgenson felt as he played with the San Francisco Blues Band, a seminal band that included keyboardist David Crosby and drummer Bill Vitt, two of Jorgenson 's idols and inspirations. ""We used to play the Fillmore in the '70s,"" Jorgenson says."

A colleague tipped back in their chair with their mouth open snoring like a bulldog is not an attractive sight. In fact it can be rather disturbing, and if that colleague is in an interview situation, they’d probably have to go back home and think about why they were doing it. I’m sure it wasn’t intentional, nor was it the first few times they’d done it, but eventually it will stick. In my experience it’s the people who stop breathing through their mouth during interviews. Breathing through your mouth isn’t very efficient.

Just a week after the election , the cracks were starting to show between Trump and Republicans on some pretty key policy issues. Trump’s new “deal” for the DREAMers is really not that different from what Obama did—but Trump got a lot of criticism for it from the right and some even called for it to be stopped. Now, with an Obamacare repeal being pushed through Congress , Trump is starting to have his cake and eat it too. Trump can claim that Obamacare repeal will be “easy” and that repealing it will make the country more free and strong.

They do the sentencing and the laws they follow to do so may not make sense . We 're asking you to weigh in. Florida 's sentencing guidelines aren 't clear . Drug offenders in many cases are sentenced to hard time for a simple drug offense , even with no prior criminal history. In some cases , offenders receive a life sentence, even though they 're convicted of a second-degree felony , a second-degree felony .

Suicide is a major cause of premature mortality worldwide.

Astronomy did n't start with the Greeks . Thousands of years earlier Aboriginal people scanned the night sky , using it as a navigational guide . But as civilisation evolved and the world became urbanised, our view of the heavens was obscured . Until very recently. For the past 60 years astronomers have been discovering thousands of ancient sites in North America and Australia that were once occupied by some of the first people to see the stars . These sites were occupied by people who used the sky as a way of telling time , to count the days and seasons and to measure the passage of time .

The press here may be the most competitive in the world . Local papers strive so hard for fresh angles and good local colour that there is almost no limit on what they can print. There is not much of a middle class here as it is still a developing country , and there are few opportunities in the private sector outside of the government. So it is not surprising to find that the people who make the media are also quite ambitious. But this does not mean that they will not do their job well. Most editors are also journalists.
It ’ s about time we had a hero older than Silly Putty but younger than Yoda . The concept of Captain America is a tough one to pin down. In the beginning, the comic and movie version of the character are pretty much identical. But by the time we were getting to the early 2000′ s, the movie version had moved into its own, more heroic version of the original character. Now, in the current decade, Marvel seems to be trying to blend the two together. And the results are a little schizophrenic.

I was a 19-year-old philosophy student , and starting to play the jazz bass , in Sheffield when I first heard about Miles Davis. I saw him first in the film Blow Up, and then at the Palladium on the London Jazz Festival in the early 70s. The music was something extraordinary to me. I went to see his band with Stanley Clarke and Chick Corea, then I bought his first solo album and went home and listened to it endlessly. Miles was a master of everything. My first meeting with the great trumpet player was very strange.

Most people know it as razor wire . It coils atop the walls and fences that divide the U.S. and Mexico at the southwestern border to prevent illegal immigrants from crossing. Others know it by its technical name: anti-climbing wire. But to Border Patrol agents who patrol the area along the U.S. – Mexico line, what it’s most commonly known for is as razor wire. The agent who brought it up to us was joking with us on a sunny day in late October, when we visited the border near Lukeville, Arizona.

While San Antonians consistently get a bad rap for being inactive , the undulating popularity of Síclovía proves this notion to be incorrect. In spite of all the negative stereotypes and misconceptions, San Antonians continue to be an active and engaged people. Despite the negative stereotypes about San Antonians and their level of political participation, a poll by the Center for Responsive Politics shows that the number of residents who participated in federal, state, and municipal elections in 2015 was the highest since 2008. The 2015 election cycles marked the highest level of voter participation since 2008, and San Antonio was no different in this regard than other communities.

It was only 8 months ago that the world was screaming that deflation was a foregone conclusion and the only question was whether it was a gradual or an acute event. Fast forward 8 months and today there are a few people in the blogosphere, some of whom I like to call, the deflationistas, who are arguing that deflation is very much a possibility that could be quite painful for the majority of Americans. My first argument to them is that we are not there yet. Yes, there are problems with the debt that have to be dealt with and they are serious problems.

Humanitarian gestures such as relief ships and truck convoys may or may not get through , but they can not change the status of the war in Syria unless they are made with the support of a military campaign, and the US is very unlikely to launch a major attack against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, if only for the obvious reasons. The UN Security Council has adopted Resolution 2165, which is supposed to impose a ceasefire in Syria. It is just one step towards the goal of a political settlement, because the ceasefire is supposed to be in place for just 30 days.

Gov . Rick Scott has a plan to prevent gun violence by banning sales of firearms to anyone under 21. He has said he'll sign the bill if it gets to his desk.

Scott says the new law won't help solve the problem.

If you see a dermatologist and they can’t find anything wrong with it, then you need a new one. The same goes with your smartphone. You know how we know the rash is not a skin condition?

And so why would the Olympics include a sport such as Golf. The Olympics are designed to be the greatest sporting event in the world. So why would they want to put golf in their Olympics ? I think the Olympics are a big mistake.

POMONA – It may not be a normal sight on a Friday in September in Southern California : Santa Claus is about to roll into town at the Santa Monica Farmers Market. But if you look closely, you’ll see that there are no little red-coated, jolly man in the suit. There’s just a man who wears a Santa Suit, who stands on a box on the stage, who uses a microphone, who says “Ho ho” and who makes kids smile as they wave their little flags in the breeze.

Rubber flip flops are hotter than ever in Manila . The timing of this trend is strangely premature since the flip flops here in the Philippines have been on the rise for a while. A good reason to look back at why flip flops continue to find a place in the Filipino’s wardrobe.

Rubber flip flops are worn in the summer months and are usually worn with shorts or cut-offs since flip flops are not allowed with jeans.

This new right fielder for the Cubs is impressive . Not like the last guy . The last guy couldn't hit a ball to save his life. This one has a little power and hits the ball over the fence. He can also hit a ball down the left field line, which is big when a left handed batter is hitting. He has no problem getting on base and is an excellent defensive outfielder. Not as good as the guy who left the team but pretty darn good. Well he is a rookie. Maybe he can come around and hit 30 homers by the end of his first full season.
"Stephen Harper has shown the ability to adapt his foreign policy position in other parts of the world , notably on Israel and Iran. But the most significant shift has been in his domestic policies.

Ched Evans is set to make his long-awaited return to action against Preston North End on Saturday after Chris Wilder gave him the all-clear following his successful return from a long-standing knee injury last time out. The Welsh international defender has been a constant source of controversy during his time on Tyneside, first with his decision to return in January 2014 after allegedly being told by then boss Alan Pardew that he would not be playing again in the club's first team. Ched went on to play just three games under new boss Steve McClaren, before being loaned out to Bury and Stockport County.

So Nintendo went and did it again with the reveal of Labo , their curious new set of build-your-own accessories for Switch. We've had a glimpse of some of the cardboard build-it-yourself sets, and now we've seen some hands-on footage with the Switch's new controller add-on, which looks to be much more elaborate that the cardboard. You will need to build it yourself in order to actually play with these, as it requires you to add your own buttons and joysticks, but that doesn't really matter, because the Labo concept is much more interesting than a game controller.

MANCHESTER UNITED may not be able to attract their top transfer targets to the club this summer . That is not because of the lack of money. It is because United have not been able to demonstrate their intent to get the deals done. The club’s chief executive, David Gill, and chief scout, Richard Arnold, know that there is no point spending big money on players if they are just going to join another one of Manchester’s clubs. Gill and Arnold have to make decisions on a number of players, starting with Juan Mata, who could leave if United were to win the Champions League.

National academy recommends legalizing tests where there is risk of serious incurable disease . The Leopoldina , Germany & apos, Portugal, and the Royal Society , U.K. & apos, France, recommend legalizing tests that pose risk of serious incurable disease.

HALIFAX—A group of courageous summer campers left their wheelchairs on the dock Wednesday afternoon to try water skiing for the first time in decades — a moment captured for the ages by a video that has gone viral.

After practising for 20 minutes with a trainer, they finally got into the water in the early afternoon — and it went surprisingly smoothly.

VANCOUVER—A loud , proud and operatic Pride celebration will descend on the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden on Aug. 31, but it’s no longer the festival of the season. Organizers say the event, the first of its kind to take place at the garden, is taking on a new theme: the celebration of all identities. The change comes in part because of a shift in how people are thinking about what a Chinese festival should be. Instead of being a traditional Chinese celebration, like the Lantern Festival, it will have a more international flavour.

Ten Brits embark on one of the toughest weeks of their lives with the secret advice of strangers from around the world. For most, their first experience of living abroad was when they attended university. But some of today's top executives have had far more extensive trips to far away lands in pursuit of their career ambitions – and have come away with a few pearls of wisdom they'd do well to bear in mind. For example, former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond was so traumatised after spending three years in South America that he quit the business in disgrace.

I remember vividly the day I realised I had diabetes . I was 12 . I was watching the ABC news, and saw a story where a woman had just had a baby. Her baby was crying , and crying . The woman had diabetes and she was having to give her baby a lot of insulin . It was such an eye opener to me , I realised that this little girl was probably crying because of diabetes . She may not know it but she would probably be crying because she was in pain and not because her mum was being unkind or mean to her.

Environmentalists also raised the alarm about the plans of the Pallekandal Catholic parish to expand its congregation. In the face of environmental criticism, the church’s pastor, Father George Kattilil, responded by saying that he would “rather have 1,000 sinners than no sinners.”

Kattilil’s response to the controversy may have been in response to a recent statement made by the bishop that the expansion would continue. He has also asked for more help from the Church’s hierarchy."

A small and shrinking school district near Los Angeles has come up with a novel way to stem its enrollment slide. Instead of sending out pink slips to nearly 500 employees, the West Hollywood School District is encouraging some employees to resign and give their jobs to those who stay. In exchange, the workers will receive a $12,000 severance package that will not be taxed under federal law, according to West Hollywood Unified School District officials. The move is the latest in a nationwide effort to stem the loss of teachers and other school employees in an era of budget cuts and high turnover.
In the days leading up to the what hopes to be the final stages of hammering out a highway bill, opponents of a $500 billion road-funding plan, known as the Surface Transportation and Recreational Development (STaRD) Act of 2015, have had plenty to complain about. Their main argument is that this bill, which was approved by the House and Senate and awaits a final signature by the President, is nothing more than a “pay-for” that will benefit the already-congested highways of the Southeast and Southwest at the expense of local roads, which they claim will be harmed.

Society could collapse at any time . Meteors , zombies , global warming , dystopian cyberpunk corporate statehood , old-fashioned plague , alien invaders -- any of them could be the final straw that sends us into the darkness. There is no shortage of ways our species could die out or be conquered by the forces of entropy. So what if we're not in danger of extinction? What if we're in danger of going extinct? You might not know it from reading the newspapers, but we're in a state of biological extinction right now, the result not of some catastrophe but of ongoing, human-driven climate change.

The New York Times ’ Farhad Manjoo recently argued for “ abolishing ” billionaires outright . Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang have made more than a passing nod to eliminating billionaires from our economy. The United States is the world’s leader in billionaires, according to Forbes , with a total of 736 in 2019. We should be doing more to stop the concentration of wealth, and we shouldn’t let an absurdly large number of people hold it. There are two big problems with the proposal. First, it would be incredibly unwise and dangerous to try to reduce billionaires’ wealth or income.
A French member of a UN patrol has been killed in an Israeli air raid in south Lebanon after a stray Israeli bomb fell on a refugee camp, the UN and French sources say. The member of the patrol was killed by a mine that detonated as he was clearing a path through the camp for UN peacekeepers, the sources said. The incident occurred around noon on Tuesday in the Tariq al-Jdideh refugee camp near the southern Lebanese town of Sidon, the sources added. The attack comes amid a wave of Israeli strikes across Lebanon following the killing of a top Hezbollah military official in a suspected Israeli strike in the country.
U.S. stocks edged up Friday , with the S & P 500 eyeing its best August performance in 14 years. The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 1,907.81. The index is just 1 percent away from its record close, set on July 24. But that level has been tested three times this year, which makes it a point of potential interest going forward. With the index at its record high, some traders may want to take a wait-and-see approach before jumping back in at such levels, while others may take a position.

ABC reports that the group `` Democrats for Life , '' whose title gives new meaning to `` oxymoronic , '' filed suit today in state court to prevent the state from imposing its abortion policies on counties in Maryland. The suit asks a judge to declare a state law that ``prohibits counties from providing public funds for abortions for county employees,'' unconstitutionally ``impermissibly discriminates'' against counties that don't provide the abortions. The suit argues that the law is an attempt to force the counties in Maryland to comply with state law.
The US has announced it is easing sanctions on Iran , allowing exports of computers , cellphones and software to the Islamic Republic, a move welcomed by Washington’s allies but which Tehran has vowed to reject. The announcement was made a day after Iran warned the move would lead to a “major war” in the region. What are the economic sanctions? US President Donald Trump signed the executive order on 11 May 2018, in a bid to increase pressure on Iran, as part of a wider strategy to isolate the country internationally.

Laura Perry from March ( back row , third from the right ) is pictured with the rest of the band. One thing that sets Perry apart from her contemporaries is that she is a singer first, and a composer and instrumentalist second. She is also very self-effacing, and does not expect much in return when she shares her musical gifts with the public. Perry grew up in Santa Ana, California. Her father was an architect, and one of her favorite memories of being a child was spending the summer in Hawaii with her dad and his work.
The star of many a board game night , Settlers of Catan is a series to which I am deeply indebted. I’ve played the game many times and I enjoy it. I can’t recall whether I played it as a child (probably not) or whether I played it when the series first came out in the early 1980s (probably not). But I do remember playing it many, many times as an adult in a friend’s living room. We’d all take turns to buy and build our own little colonies, competing for the most territory.

The Standard & Poor's 500 Index had fallen more than a fifth since April of that year and had not regained the level of the summer of 2007, when the economy had been in the throes of the housing boom.

A week ago, all you heard from the White House was, ""I've got a mandate to do X, Y, and Z."" Today, a new tone has been set."
With the massive beer tanks removed and the once-exposed rooftops patched and braced , developers of the American Brewery building are making plans for its future. But it will be a different kind of future – one far more diverse and urban-focused. A proposal has been submitted to the city planning commission for a “mixed-use development,” and would include an office building, condos and retail space. Plans are being drawn up, with architects expected to present the proposal at the March 13 planning commission meeting. The site, once used as a beer distribution warehouse, has been vacant since its current owners sold their property to American Brewery.
Appearing most recently in Amazon ’ s comedic drama Mozart in the Jungle and David Lynch ’ s Twin Peaks—in both cases, as a small role—Hudgens has also been a staple of film and television. She’s also appeared in a slew of films that, while not as big as those aforementioned three, have also made an impression on her career. Most notably, her breakthrough performance as a young girl coping with her mother ’ s sudden death (though she was actually eight at the time of filming), in The Fisher King, helped her secure a number of roles in adult films.
As children rode their bikes to the sound of leaf blowers on Wednesday , Redwood Avenue in Costa Mesa showed just how much a person could do to improve public health in their community, and just how quickly things could change. For years, city officials have talked about changing the law to allow homeowners to use outdoor power tools like leaf blowers and snow blowers, as well as power washers, while children walk or bike to nearby school zones. The problem was, city staff and the Planning Commission said it was illegal, and in 2012 the City Council declined to change the ordinance.

The U.S. Open and Stefan Edberg go together a little bit like hot pastrami and mayonnaise . The last time that happened was in 1985, and Edberg was just a wild-card entry in the tournament. The Open is the pinnacle of men’s singles tennis, and when a player wins the event it’s like a gold-medal-winning marathon runner being crowned the world-class champion at the Summer Olympics . And while that was true for a lot of those Open champions before the Open became the Open (which started in 1969) was, there was one notable exception: Boris Becker .

Consumer advocates say the rules will help the majority of people and will save borrowers from the exorbitant fees imposed by payday lenders.

`` While subject to change , it is currently anticipated that Time Warner will not need to transfer any of the assets for sale to the buyer .

If Time Warner did decide to sell the assets however , the buyout of Time Warner would be a lot more complicated .

The answer they got , it's not us , not the sun, no one knows what it is . And all they can do is say that science is wrong and we should all go on with our lives and not worry . And they're right , we should just stop worrying , but if we do that , we can't have an economy , we can't have a future . So we just have to do nothing and let things continue as they're going .

In an era of big data , where our every move is seemingly captured and recorded , traditional means of identifying who we are through our identity documents could soon become obsolete.

But are our faces the only things we carry with us?
She yearns for clarity and certainty . Or does she ? Deep ambivalence is the spirit Greengrass conveys in a film where the protagonist's actions are governed not by any discernible logic but by her emotional state . At times she is self-destructive , and at others , self-assured. She does things for no apparent reason, and is unable to explain her motivations. At other times, she appears self-sacrificing . Sylvia's character is a cipher , one of the film's key strengths. She never explains herself or the choices she makes . She is simply . . . there.

Stephen F. Cohen , professor of Russian studies at New York University and Nation contributing editor , joined Democracy Now! to discuss Russian disinformation and how it has spread on the internet during the US election. He discusses how Russia has become more active on social media in the lead up to the election, and how Russia has been successful in using Facebook, Twitter and other social media to spread its disinformation. Cohen argues that Russian disinformation is a part of the Russian plan to undermine democratic elections and the United States as a nation.
From now until Saturday , millions of people globally are joining in with actions around the world with the single purpose of saying “enough.” We are declaring a worldwide day of action in which people will take to the streets, the road, the rails, the canals, the rivers, and all other means of transportation to draw attention to the growing threat of fossil fuels and to demand immediate and urgent action on the part of our governments and political leaders. This is the week that all of that comes to a head, because next week’s COP21 climate talks will commence in Paris.
"Developed by Frictional Games , survival horror and deep-sea thriller , SOMA , boasts terrifying scenes of high tension while maintaining a calm and patient atmosphere

SOMA's story takes place in the year 2155, when most people live in high-rise underwater habitats. These habitats have all but disappeared in the oceans of the world, replaced instead by massive floating cities that contain everything that the people of the past could desire. However, the high-rises themselves are in danger of sinking, and a group of scientists are attempting to discover what caused this to happen."

"It ’ s easy to book a three-hour flight online , but a five-day cruise has a bit more riding to do . “ It ’ s an adventure in a way but also very relaxing ,’’ she says . “ If it ’ s an adventure, the cruise can also be challenging, because I don ’ t know where I ’ m going or what I ’ ll see . ”

The rush to suburbia that transformed the United States over the last 50 years began to slow down in the 1980s. But it’s still moving in the wrong direction, the Census Bureau projects. In 2014, nearly 45 million households — more than the entire population of Sweden — will rent their homes to someone else, up from about 37.8 million in 2010, a Census Bureau report released Monday showed. At that pace, the nation won’t hit the 50 million mark again until 2033, and will likely pass the 65 million mark sometime in the mid-21st Century.

A report in the South Africa Press Association on Saturday (9 July) said the Tshwane mayor said the tournament has lost the city millions in the past three years, and if the organisers are serious about a solution, they should hand it back to the Soweto Municipality. In 2014 and 2015, the South African city lost more than R15m in tournament expenses because the organiser could not find accommodation for the players in Pretoria.
The U.S. Senate is set to vote on a measure this week that conservation groups say could have devastating consequences for the country's imperiled bald eagles. It could also undermine conservation efforts to save the bird, one of the most iconic American species. The House and Senate will vote on the Save the Bald Eagle Preservation Act, which was introduced in 2013 by Rep. Mike Simpson, a Republican congressman from Idaho. If the measure passes in the Senate later this week, it would go next to the White House for a signature. The bill would also go into effect 90 days after the president’s signature.
The totalitarian left should be upset because “ Expelled ” is a wry , funny , well-crafted documentary . The documentary tells the story , in a wry , funny , documentary sort of way , of how a few college professors , aided by some of their sympathizers , launched a campaign to remove from college campuses a man who has devoted much of his life to exposing what they regard as the flaws and evils of communism . I don't think it is the left's job to promote their ideas on campuses . They don't have the time or the resources .

Studies in this week ’ s Hutchins Roundup find that an increase in the duration of unemployment benefits had little effect on employment, and that raising the minimum wage does not lead to higher employment levels in low income households. We also examine the impact of the Great Recession on the American workforce, and the effect of the Great Recession and the Great Jobs Recession on job growth. The Great Recession, caused by the sub-prime loan crisis, began in the summer of 2007. However, it has become clear in recent research that the effects of job losses and foreclosures had begun much earlier.
I decided last weekend not to join in on air as raucous media and online condemnation of a group of men in Australia was being expressed. I felt that I was not equipped to add to that, and that it would be more helpful to the men and women of our nation if we instead turned our focus on what was going to be needed to support our brothers and sisters. The men and women who were targeted and their loved ones could have been me. There are so many reasons to support those who face these injustices.

Several experts on riot control criticized the Police Department yesterday , saying it appeared to have moved too swiftly to use chemical agents to stop the crowds of demonstrators. ''There has been a pattern of the Police Department rushing to use chemical agents without a full understanding of the effect of the chemicals, and I think that is what happened again yesterday,'' said James L. Fox, former director of the Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Police, at Columbia University Law School. ''The Police Department needs to learn how to deal with these groups of people in a more sophisticated manner,'' he said.
"Will Steve Mason be the main man in net for the Flyers all season ? As the Flyers prepare for Sunday's game at the Boston Bruins, we examine Mason's performance in the last two games and whether he could be the guy who gets the Flyers out of a slump they are in. READ MORE ›

A week ago, Steve Mason gave up a first period power play goal and a goal early in the third to drop a 3-1 win to the Buffalo Sabres and give him a 1-4-1 record in seven starts. On Saturday, he dropped a 3-0 shutout win over the Vancouver Canucks with 35 saves."
The effects of the government shutdown are trickling down to the TSA , causing longer than normal wait times . The Transportation Security Administration says it’s experiencing severe problems at its airport screening facilities because many federal employees — including airport screeners — are not showing up for their shifts on Thursday. “Due to operational challenges related to the lapse of funding, and the potential for adverse impacts on security operations, TSA will continue to experience severe challenges at security checkpoints, leading to increased wait times,” wrote TSA spokesman Lorie Dankers in an email. Some airports have longer wait times than others.
"As the work and pensions secretary says vendors of the Big Issue exploited a loophole allowing immigrants access to UK welfare schemes, we ask how the DWP is tackling this problem

It is hard to think of a group that is so reviled and distrusted as immigrants are. According to a poll of British voters conducted by Lord Ashcroft earlier this year, almost two-thirds – 64 per cent – agreed that immigration was ‘wasteful’. Almost one in four – 24 per cent – said they thought Britain was being ‘swamped’ by immigrants."
"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un must be eliminated if North Korea ’ s threat to global security is to be eliminated, says South Korean President Moon Jae-in during his speech at a forum of the National Security Council on the threat from North Korea held at the National Assembly on Sept. 27. (Yonhap)



By Kim Da-sol





President Moon Jae-in has said he is ready to end the Korean War by declaring a full withdrawal of the 50,000 soldiers of the U.S.-led United Nations Command in exchange for a full, verifiable halt to Kim Jong-un's nuclear program."
I have to admit : When I imagine an activist fighting to make violence against women a thing of the past, I picture a white woman, living on a farm with her children in a small town. It’s a stereotype, of course, and one I would like to change. But in case you haven’t noticed, white women, particularly American women, tend to get most of the attention in mainstream media and popular culture, as they should. So it makes sense to put that face on the movement in the first place.

Science is not a democracy . But as Paul Willis explains , the consilience of evidence for theories such as the big bang, evolution, and the big bang theory is so great, you can't ignore the data. A few days ago, the New York Times posted an article by Stephen Hawking on the meaning of human existence. It was an excellent interview, with an excellent interviewee. As I've said before, I'm quite fond of his work, although I can't personally agree with some of his claims about the universe's origin.

That's all she can hope to do, is just keep up the work she's doing. I don't know if there is anything she can do more.
Social activists and local authorities in Rapa Nui or Easter Island are calling for urgent action to address rising sea levels that have threatened their ancestral lands. Rapa Nui, the island with the oldest human settlement on Earth, is located in the South Pacific Ocean, 2,000 kilometers east of Chile. The indigenous inhabitants of the island are the moai or moai statues, which can be found all around the island. The Rapa Nui are the original inhabitants of this island, and over the last 500 years the island has been completely abandoned.
Slow growth seen as early sign that tax code changes hurt philanthropy . Charitable giving in the United States rose 3.3 percent in 2016 from the year before. In 2017, it rose 2.6 percent, the first time it has fallen below 3 percent since 2009. The charitable giving rate is projected to increase just 2.7 percent to $312.1 billion in 2018, down from $315.6 billion in 2017. Philanthropy is one of the fastest-growing areas of American society — but a new report released this week suggests that the tax code changes signed into law by President Trump in 2017 may be putting an end to its growth in the U.S.

A U.S. judge is blaming PG & E for most of Northern California ’ s deadly wildfires over the past decade, and the company has agreed to pay more than a billion dollars in civil fines. And yet the electric utility’s customers will not see any reduction in rates, because California’s Public Utilities Commission says PG & E can continue to pay dividends, a practice that has helped the company pay off its most expensive liabilities. That’s because PG & E is not like any other California utility.

Jenson Button admitted he had no answer to Kamui Kobayashi 's pace as the Sauber driver beat him to third place in the Canadian Grand Prix, the first time he'd finished ahead of his teammate this year. Button qualified third for the race, a result that was enough to deny Williams driver Rubens Barrichello the championship lead he held for most of the weekend. Button overtook pole sitter Sebastian Vettel 's Ferrari for second on the grid, and held the position until Kobayashi's move for the last podium position, but was left frustrated after what he believes was an off-track incident at Turn 2.

In memory of a Nobelist and a dear friend . It was after that , though I no longer remember why , that I came to feel that what we call reality was itself a construct , like so many other things in our lives and culture , and that we needed to take into account both our perceptions of reality and our constructs that we had of reality , both of which are often mutually dependent . There are at least three levels of constructs that need to be distinguished. There's the external reality , which may or may not be true or real .
Local political leaders are calling on city schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña to remove an unpopular principal from a top Queens elementary school — even though he has done a good job as a school leader, an education source and a community activist. Fariña needs to act because she made a promise when she took the top post last year, sources told The Post. She told parents she would “ensure that schools are places of safety, opportunity and learning, and that all teachers have the time and support necessary to do the job they are trained to do,” a school source said.

He also will be on the wrong end of a two-shot swing."

NATO turned 70 on April 4 . It is a timely occasion for the world 's largest military alliance to assess itself and to define its purpose and role. It is also a fitting moment for Americans to look at ourselves and to think about how the United States should best be involved in Europe's affairs. The Soviet Union's collapse on December 25, 1991, and NATO 's entry into Bosnia in 1992 was the end of the Cold War, but it also signaled the beginning of the end of a bipolar world and the beginning of a multipolar one.
There was n't much need for coach Steve Spurrier to wear a headset during USC 's loss to Vanderbilt last Saturday. “I guess you have to have somebody on your staff that does,” Spurrier said Wednesday. “We have one, and I didn’t.

But at the same time you just can’t get out of rhythm.

"Are Republican and Democratic Brains Different ? A new study concludes that everyone uses reason to persuade , not to persuade everyone.

Democrats are more likely to argue from the position, “No, we don’t need to do that, because we already agreed to it, or because that’s how we usually do things, or that’s the way we’ve always done that.” Republicans usually make their case by showing “why.”

Do Republicans and Democrats have different brains? Do they look at different information?"

We expect the US stock market to close out the year lower than when it opened the year. A number of economic news items have been negative over the past few weeks.
The three Baltic countries that could be left to the mercies of Russia during a Donald Trump presidency reacted with horror to his election victory, but they may be too late in reacting. The danger is greatest in Estonia, where the Russians have the highest number of troops on the ground and have been steadily increasing the intensity and scope of their operations ever since they occupied and annexed Crimea in 2014. It would be foolish to underestimate the Kremlin’s ambition to reassert control over the country, especially as its forces are still based just across the water on the other side of Estonia’s narrowest border with Russia.

The current talks between the representatives of the Taliban and the US Government in Qatar are an important step but they are only the beginning of a long journey. The Taliban are a fundamentalist group and their agenda has always been the creation of a Taliban-led Islamic State in Afghanistan and beyond.

Afghanistan has been plagued with a number of Taliban insurgency and terrorist attacks and the group is once again in the spotlight.

But to make sure each space was an inspiring and comfortable place for workers to spend time, engineers spent weeks poring over images of everything from Paris to Amsterdam.

Dear people who have worked and struggled for Black Liberation since the 60s: we’ve had our share of setbacks, and much of what we’ve fought for over the years has not yet been realized.

Is Ralph ready to run ? Activists have plenty of good reasons to challenge the Democratic Party operatives who focus more on electing Barack Obama than winning back the House. They know that it will take a strong campaign to make a difference. I have a better question: How can Ralph and his campaign be sure he's prepared to win? Last night, the campaign announced that it has raised $1 million in two weeks. That's fine. But it doesn't mean he's going to win, because the campaign has yet to test the waters.

"2 What Causes a Creaking & Popping Noise in Hardwood Floors ? Squeaky floors are almost always caused by nails that are set too closely together. When the wood expands as it dries (as it does naturally) it pulls the nails out of alignment. This forces the floor to ""creak"". Creaking is more noticeable if you go on a ""creak test"" where you stand on one leg and lightly shake a foot. If the floor moves and sounds louder, it could be due to a nail pulling completely out of the wood. You can use a nail gun to pull nails out."

The interview between Dr. Dre and Suge went viral overnight, but in an interview with Complex on Thursday, OG Ice Cream Truck shared his take on the entire thing.
The media has been awash in allegations of bad behavior by white Trump supporters intimidating minorities and Trump rejectors intimidating supporters.

The original complaint against the people in question was made in a public Facebook thread. It was later amended and expanded to include additional accusations, which I will address below.
Pat Green learned a long time ago to take opinions with a grain of salt . The San Antonio native was never very good at math, he admits. That hasn’t stopped Green, though—he’s been doing the best he can to make sense of how the world’s best team is going to win a title. The NBA has been a long time coming back to the San Antonio Spurs, but when Green first heard about the possibility of the club making it back, he was skeptical of his hometown team making such a run.
Sipping vodka under chandeliers in a cool private club on the Lower East Side , the New York elite — the hedge fund managers , lawyers and politicians — talked about the city’s financial crisis , but their words were drowned out by music. As soon as a song came on, the crowd started to sway. If the music was too slow, they tapped their toes; if it was a fast song, they started to bounce. And when the song ended, someone else took the microphone. It’s a long time since a New York party has been this electric.

The states argued that Trump's executive order violates the Constitution because it treats Muslim immigrants differently than people from other countries.

Quite obviously , India can not move forward unless she takes all her women along . India can race ahead if she has women leaders in the highest positions. We have seen it happening in the past that when women have been in leadership position they have done a great job in taking the nation forward in the right direction. We need to follow up the example set by former PM Rajiv Gandhi where he had given the highest position in the country to women. They have done a wonderful job, and I hope we continue to follow their footsteps in the coming times.

the administration refuses to answer for the lack of job creation and growth resulting from almost $ 16 billion spent in the stimulus plan, it is not credible to believe that they can now claim that this spending caused the job loss that has resulted from the slowest recovery in the post-1945 period. It is not credible because the administration has already estimated the number of lost jobs caused by this spending; it was more than 10 million - the total number of people who have lost jobs since February 2009. So why do they now say the jobs loss was much larger than they thought?
The stock dipped 7 per cent to Rs 1,016 on BSE after the company 's consolidated net profit more-than-halved at Rs 5.8bn for fiscal 2016. It was on course for its third straight annual loss after reporting a loss of Rs 1.19 billion in fiscal year 2015-16. The loss at the end of the current fiscal was attributable to an exceptional item of Rs 9.3 billion. That figure included Rs 8.9 billion in impairment charge, Rs 1.2 billion in net loss and Rs 485.5 million in tax. The tax loss was largely due to the Rs 4.9-billion provision made on the valuation of the non-cash impairment of convertible debt.

The Dartmouth

It is good to see that Dartmouth College — America’s most prestigious school for white males — has joined the ranks of schools that are embracing historical
accountability. Now that the New York Times has called for the
abolition of white privilege, Dartmouth has decided that it would be
advisable for it to take a similar stance."
Excited ? About DLC ? I 'd normally rather throw myself under a bus , seeing as 90 % of people I've met here have said I'm a dick, but I'm all up for the next adventure. It's just that this time, when the time came, there were none to be had at the store. But that was because I got it on release day. So now, with all the money I'm saving by not buying it, I can pick it up on a Monday instead. I think. That's pretty much how I was feeling.

I want to share some things that I have learned over my time with social networking sites. I think there are some things that you can take into your business as well.
I purchased the highest-priced coffee maker of this type because the box says the 6-spray head is a benefit . I think it is a great feature to be able to make lots of different coffees at once with such a small head, however my experience is that I can’t use more than about a 6-cup capacity and have had to buy a 12-cup model. Also, although the basket is small, it fills up pretty quickly. This is my favorite of the espresso machines we tested, and with good reason: it makes an exceptional cup of drip-brewed coffee, perfect every single time.

It might be easier to integrate the processes in your organization using one of the available pre-built modules.

For more than a year , Facebook has endured cascading crises — over Russian misinformation , data privacy and abusive ads — that have upended the social-media platform. But in the wake of the 2016 election and the Cambridge Analytica scandal in particular, Facebook and the tech industry are also facing an existential threat: a backlash against Silicon Valley and its obsession with data-driven algorithms.

After picking up in 2010 , economic growth slowed in the first six months of 2011 , the government reported a 1.5 percent expansion , the slowest rate in three years . While growth is slowing , the pace remains above the 1-3 percent average seen since World War II . The current expansion has been driven by an unusually large surge in U.S. consumer spending, supported by historically low interest rates , which have encouraged borrowing. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, and it has powered the expansion . But that growth isn't evenly spread throughout the economy.
Wild Turkey again ? It looks like Craig Beam 's not the only one who wants what Jimmy Russell makes. This year there is something that has not been happening since last year when he brought in his son to help work with him. Jimmy Russell has a son who has not worked on the farm and has no experience working with wild turkeys. At this rate I don't think the farm will be able to sustain itself. He is getting in over his head at the age of 45. Maybe it would be time to get off your duffs and make some money for yourself and your sons.

New U.S. Air Force calculations put the 6-ton satellite 's death plunge early Saturday thousands of miles from northwestern North Korea on par with the power of a nuclear bomb, though the Pentagon said it was not planning to release any information on the satellite's demise or whether it had hit a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that is also parked near Japan. Officials said they have no way to determine whether debris from a U.S. missile destroyed the satellite, but said it could not be ruled out because North Korea is known to put satellites into polar orbit to track U.S. missile tests.

The tolls were approved in October by the State of California Transportation Agency and are expected to bring in more than $ 1 billion per year in new toll revenue for San Francisco, Marin, Alameda and Contra Costa counties, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.
The Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to sign off on putting a toll increase on the June ballot — not the 2 percent increase that had been under consideration for years. That’s a move that Supervisor Jane Kim has already vowed to block, with her own proposed toll hike to raise the same amount, plus another penny per year for 10 more years — to raise an additional $80 million to pay for schools. The vote came on an emergency motion that Supervisor Aaron Peskin proposed just hours before the July 1 deadline to have a toll increase on the November ballot.
By esiegel on October 24 , 2016 . Ever since we first began observing Mars up close , there was one feature we’ve never understood — how could Mars have so much atmosphere without having volcanoes? We know that volcanism can create an atmosphere, but that’s not what we see. Instead, it seems like the only way for Mars to hold on to all of its atmosphere is if there’s a continuous replenishment from something else. And it seems like a lot of that atmosphere has gone missing. So where did all that extra atmosphere go?

"Are Politicians More Dangerous to American Democracy than ISIS or Al Qaeda ? America can learn a lot from tribal wars, particularly the way in which tribal wars are used to serve the interest of the United States, its allies and NATO, and suppress and/or contain rivals of the West. While Western media focus on ISIS and Al Qaeda, we need to take a broader view of the situation. Tribal Wars in Afghanistan:

The US and its allies use the Taliban as proxy force to attack the Taliban and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan to subvert the Northern Alliance."

His “ child-murderer ” rhetoric about the NRA and its supporters is obnoxious , but so are the Facebook memes he has posted about the shootings in Dayton , Ohio , that have been circulating through the media . In a way, it’s hard to blame him. In a media landscape dominated by cable channels and the internet, Trump’s ability to reach voters directly is unprecedented for a presidential candidate. That gives him the kind of reach that would allow him to dominate the national agenda in ways that previous Republican nominees could only dream of.

A three-day film festival spotlights a few fab flicks . A WISH : We realize that there are a number of films that were produced in the last five years that are not being played at any festival.

One of my favorite films of the 1990 ’ s is Alexander Payne ‘ s brilliant dark comedy Election starring an ensemble cast that features a stellar turn from Robert Duvall and a stellar performance from Jack Nicholson. The film, directed by Payne and co-written by him and Eric Roth , is a satirical look at American politics. Although it was a big hit with audiences when it was first released, Payne later disowned it . The film also features a cameo from Bill Murray ( in the background of one of his scenes ) that is considered by many to be Murray ‘ s most memorable and iconic.

In 2000 , the U.S. Navy decided to outsource the management and maintenance of its computer systems to EDS . The contract was to include a major upgrade and expansion of the Pentagon's network infrastructure. EDS , which had won the contract two years previously to operate the Defense Data Network ( DDN ) and the Navy's Wide Area Workstation Network ( NWAWN ) systems, would be responsible for managing both systems. EDS was chosen over other companies that had bid, in part because the contract was too large and complex for most of the other bidders to take on, even if they won.

Councils across the country are gearing up for the annual moment when they ask their residents to pay hundreds of thousands, or even millions of pounds, more in taxes than they received in government grants. It’s a tricky balancing act. The more money councils receive in government money the more they can give back in council tax. But the bigger that gap, the harder that balancing act can be and the more likely the council will face an outcry of protest from angry taxpayers. This is the challenge facing Birmingham city council this week, as it announces its budget for next year.

READ my lips . An invention can recognise “ silent speech ” by keeping tabs on your tongue and ears . But it’s not easy to create an intelligent machine that can understand and learn your speech from the beginning. That’s why in a recent research work, researchers at Google’s London office created a new AI (Artificial Intelligence) system that can actually learn how to write text, just by hearing people speak. They have achieved it by developing a learning model that can automatically extract relevant audio features such as frequency and timbre , and a word embedding model to understand what a specific word means.

In a possible precursor for Netflix ’ s entry into major Emmy competition , “ House of Cards ” scored big last night at the 2014 Creative Arts Emmys — not just in the best drama category, but in five others.

There are many ways to spend an afternoon in Boston's Greenways, parks, and squares, but the most popular, and perhaps most important, are to exercise, exercise, exercise. In fact, Boston's first Greenway, Forest Park on the edge of downtown, was created for just that: walking, strolling and exercise. So it was fitting last year when the Boston Public Garden hosted the first annual 10th birthday bash for its Greenway."

Despite an encouraging start , Arsenal face another battle for fourth . Who 'd have thought Paul Scholes would offer so much competition for the number 10 position at his boyhood club? The Gunners will have their hands full as they welcome the free-scoring Scholes back to the Emirates as their new midfield foil. The former United ace's influence will be immense on a team he is used to playing as a No.10. It will be interesting to see how Arsenal adapt to his free-scoring play , especially since the team has been built on an all-pervading defensive strategy .
How does the latest release hold up to an OG ? Assassin 's Creed II took players to beautifully rendered Italy in AC1 and ACII . ACII is not a reboot but rather a continuation of the AC1 storyline. I played the game again and there is so much stuff that has been added that ACII is actually much better than AC. It is the perfect sequel. I am really happy with it . It has so much stuff that was left out of the original AC. The gameplay is more realistic and has a deeper plot line than AC1.

Acrylic tubs need to be mounted on a level and stable subfloor . The key to fixing a squeaky acrylic tub is to remove the tub and seal all of the joints and seams with the proper caulk, and then reattach it to the floor to prevent leaks. The key to making sure it doesn’t leak is installing an acrylic tub liner, which is a membrane of acrylic, PVC, or silicone rubber. These liners not only will keep your tub from leaking, but they protect your tub and floor from scratching and damage. There are two different types of tub liners: acrylic and PVC.

Robert Downey Jr.'s new film ""Chappie"" had a decent weekend box office performance, opening to $18 million in North America alone.

Do you think our political system is working great ? If your answer is “ no , ” then you are the perfect candidate to be the next Democratic candidate for Congress in the 11th District. That is because it would be very easy to win and very hard to be elected after you lost the district. If you do not think the political system is working great, you will not vote for a candidate like me and I do not think you should be the representative for the people of Alabama’s 11th district. In my opinion, you would represent the people and not your party.

When you think of military bases , honor , discipline and commitment might come to mind ; but culture ? How do we define it ? Do we have to ? What is cultural influence on the society , on its people and institutions ? How do we measure the difference ? How does it impact our thinking and perception ? How does it help or hinders us ?

Hood also rejected a motion by the university to dismiss the suit based on a statute of limitations bar.

SANDERSON — It is the first time anyone has stepped foot in the space, so it's no small surprise when you learn the space used to be a bar, which closed in late October of last year.

"One of the biggest losers from Tuesday 's election was Women At The Table , an organization formed last year to address sexism, misogyny, discrimination, and racism in business, government, and the arts, as well as other fields. The organization was formed during the 2008 Presidential Campaign, with the goal of ""making it easier for women and people of color to achieve leadership in their chosen fields,"" but since the election it hasn't exactly been making strides. The group started its first round of activism in September 2009 with a campaign against Fox News host Sean Hannity for his comments about Sarah Palin's gender."
What if filmmakers didn ’ t have to rely solely on film markets and sales agents to sell content ? Filmmakers are becoming more aware of their audience, which means that they are starting to understand the value of their audience as consumers and how they engage with content. There is a natural shift occurring in the business of film distribution, which is the rise of self-financed, indie films made with the help of crowdfunding and micro-budget platforms. In the UK alone there are now over 400 micro-budget films, and it is predicted that in 10 years’ time we’ll see over 1,000.

This brings us to a hot take — care of the Catholic News Agency — on the recent meetings held in Washington, DC, between the U.S. bishops and the Obama administration. This was a conference called under the auspices of the United States Bishops’ Conference. This conference was called at the request of the Bishops’ Conference. It wasn’t held in a hotel in DC. It wasn’t paid for by taxpayers. It was paid for by private Catholic groups. The USCCB wasn’t invited to this meeting, but they were told that it was held in their name.
LAKEWOOD , Colo. -- The Colorado State Patrol is using marijuana DUI devices as part of a three-year pilot program to improve the way troopers test for the presence of THC or cannabis in the blood after being arrested for DUIs. For the past several years, troopers have had an option of using a portable breath test or a test of saliva to check drivers' blood alcohol levels. The breath test and saliva test results are sent to state toxicology labs. But troopers can also perform a chemical analysis of a blood sample -- a procedure that costs more, is more invasive and can take longer, according to troopers.

Virginia has a chance to do some major Medicaid-related work this winter, and there are good reasons to think that if we can pull it off, we will. Here are some reasons why:



1. It’s easy. To get the legislature to act on Medicaid expansion (or any other important state program) is easy, and the task will be much easier to accomplish than to do it in the context of the budget."
Bill Belichick has never been one to tip his hand on anything , especially his plans leading into a game or in the offseason. In fact, if he did talk about things, you can bet that he wasn't doing anything that he didn't believe in or wouldn't say anything about it in public. With all that said, it was very interesting to read that Belichick's son-in-law Matt Higgins is now an intern at ESPN. Matt's father, Mike, was a producer with the Patriots before becoming director of pro scouting for the Browns and Browns assistant general manager.

Asian financial markets and regulatory bodies need to understand and learn from the mistakes of the West or risk having the global crisis replicated in Asia. It's time to break the pattern. In 2007-2009, the Western world suffered an economic downturn as the global economy slid into a recession, and many of its economies struggled to emerge from it. Now the world economy is recovering and many Western economies have stabilized, but Asia is still struggling. It is often said that Europe is a problem child for the world economy but Asia is a problem as well.

Can you tell us about how you got to this point where it's time for a major change in Peter Parker's life and the Marvel Universe?
Not everyone responds well to losing . The FBI is searching for one sore loser who apparently was so upset over a recent loss in a contest that he went and shot two of his fellow contestants. It’s happened before, but the victim of that shooting was a woman, so I’m wondering if there are any differences in the way guys and women view these things. I know I’d probably be in a lot less of a tizzy than I am over it all if it was a girl I lost to in some contest and she got hurt instead of me.
Eric Gary Barnes thought his first name sounded too much like “ ear ache ” for his liking . So he decided to add a middle initial instead. “I felt like it sounded cooler, so it just became Eric Gary ,” Barnes, 24, explained while sitting on the bench outside of his parents’ home in New London, Wis., the evening of Nov. 5, 2014 — the day of his 18th birthday. And so he became Eric. For the next four years, however, Barnes’ life would be changed forever.
Almost twice as many people have been deported from Germany in 2015 so far after having their asylum applications rejected as compared to the whole of 2014.

There were 9,943 expulsions from Germany in the first nine months of 2015. Despite the fact it is not possible to deport unaccompanied minors to Serbia and Germany is obliged to inform Serbia when minors arrive at German border crossings, only 8 unaccompanied refugee children arrived in Serbia in the first three quarters of 2015.
Are Men the New Minority ? According to this graph of Canadian medical school enrollment , men outnumbered women by more than 2 to 1 from 1971 to 2001. This was an anomaly, and women outnumbered men in the medical field from the 1930's through the mid-1960's. The number of men in the medical field dropped by over 20,000 and women's enrollment increased. So why is it, that from 2001 on, men are starting to outnumber women again ? Is it something in the water? I don't know, but something is happening to men and it's the subject of much discussion today.
Entrepreneur Arthur Solomon , who already owns two minor-league baseball teams , recently inquired about purchasing the Syracuse Chiefs . He also inquired about buying an NHL team , according to people familiar with the conversation. Solomon didn't get the answer he was seeking, they said.

"PASADENA , Calif. – Astronomers have spotted a swirling debris cloud around a sun-like star where terrestrial planets similar to Earth might have once existed.

Maybe it 's just because I 'm focused on the dead Americans in Benghazi and Algeria and the millions giving up their lives for lack of health insurance, but sometimes I wonder what people are thinking when they decide to support a political party or candidate over the other, as though there are really two different parties. The only difference is that one 's Democrat and the other Republican. It doesn 't have to be a Democrat and a Republican. Democrats and Republicans think the same. They both want more government, more spending, more taxes.

“There is no doubt at all that there is a coordinated information campaign by the Russians to interfere with the presidential election of the United States.” That is the statement, made by none other than the former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John Negroponte back in 2016. Since then we have seen a steady stream of articles by mainstream US media, that seem to indicate, that Russia interfered in the last US election."

Social-service agencies would assist people . The city of Minneapolis has recommended that a coalition of social-service agencies manage the new shelter. It is not clear if the coalition is willing to take over the job or if the city will pursue its option to take over the shelter. In Minneapolis, one of the few large cities left in Minnesota, the issue of homelessness is growing. In 2010, city officials announced that a downtown shelter for the chronically homeless would close in early 2011. They hoped that by eliminating a shelter for the homeless, people living on the streets would be encouraged to seek housing.

To the editor : While a majority of Americans oppose Justice Brett Kavanaugh ’ s confirmation to the Supreme Court, it is clear that many of us remain unhinged, unwilling to admit that Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexually abusing a classmate in the early 1980s, is a rapist. To me, a sexual assault is rape. If I know it and he knows it, why is it any different from an attempted rape? And if he did the things that the accuser has claimed, he’d know that it wasn’t okay.
Researchers at William & Mary , with collaborators from the University of Connecticut , have discovered a way of measuring levels of nitrogen dioxide in groundwater. This method could be of great importance to those who need to know how far nitrogen is being pumped into their water supplies, and whether they need to be concerned. The team of researchers came up with a way to measure nitrogen in groundwater that relies on the use of fluorescent molecules. Fluorescent molecules emit different colours of light depending on their molecular composition. Researchers were able to use a method called fluorescence resonance energy transfer in order to measure the level of NO2.

The fact that Ricky Gervais was even allowed to present the Golden Globes is a joke in and of itself ."
It has n't always been easy to root for the Silver and Black , but the Baseline Bums have been a joy since they were created. They’ve gone winless three times in seven years, but for whatever reason, fans in Columbus keep rooting for them. And the players keep proving they deserve it.

They then went 3-1-1 in their final five regular-season games to win the Central Division title, the second in franchise history.

A ship provides a good example of how organisations should run . If the captain , executive officers and crew have not prepared for a particular situation, even if the captain has a detailed plan, they can still be caught out by an unexpected situation that they are unprepared for. If a ship is carrying oil from Nigeria, there is a reasonable expectation that it should not run aground on the coast of Libya. It may be necessary to alter the planned route because of a military conflict or because of a lack of supplies, or other unforeseen factors.

The world 's a mess . How do thoughtful people make sense of it all ? In this series we look at what philosophers are doing to understand, to understand better, and sometimes even to fix things up.

Then I switched again, and now I’m doing epistemology. I’ve written several dozen books, including two collections of essays, and edited two more.

But this can also be an unreliable way of determining someone's likelihood of ADHD , since symptoms can also arise from other mental health issues. In order to determine whether someone has ADHD, clinicians use a series of standardized questionnaires called diagnostic interviews. In addition, they may perform a physical and neurological exam on the patient to confirm or rule out other illnesses. A number of scales are used by doctors, parents, teachers, therapists, and researchers to determine whether a person has ADHD.

As a stock market investor, you'd be wise to consider this possibility and act before the market starts to turn. If you want a stock market investing guide for beginners, look no further than The Wall Street Examiner."

SpaceX is all about reducing the cost of launching things into space , and right now one of those costs is the price it charges to use a launchpad. It costs the company a lot of money to build these giant rocket launch pads, and then to lease them to customers who want a ride into orbit. That's something that's been in the news for a while now: the fact that the price of launching a single payload into orbit can be much higher than the price of a rocket that can launch that same payload into space.
A recent article in Wired , Danger Room highlighted the resurgence of the US drone campaign in Pakistan . While the article acknowledged the growing international criticism of the US drone use, it largely ignored the human consequences of that use. On May 31, 2011, US drone operators in the FATA fired missiles at three vehicles carrying four alleged Al-Qaeda members. When they stopped to help the injured survivors of the blast, the men fled and hid in nearby houses. But they were discovered and taken into custody by the US military. All four men were subsequently released after the US promised not to file charges.
Between 1300 and 1600 the Western world was transformed . An extraordinary wave of artistic and cultural innovation shattered medieval society. The new Renaissance style of art and architecture changed the world of art and society in the most profound ways. It altered how people saw the world, how people understood their place within it, and how they connected to it. It changed the ways they interacted with each other and made their cities, towns and homes more comfortable and attractive. In this time a new way of thinking about time and space also came to dominate.

Leading the latest edition of the ISMG Security Report : Kevin McDonald , director of clinical information security at Mayo Clinic, says health information systems can be hacked into using traditional phishing attacks, as well as spear-phishing attacks. Read how Mayo uses a risk-driven approach for managing cyber risk. As organizations face an increased level of attacks from hackers, they need to address the problem from the perspective of the people affected by them. They need to identify where and how an attack occurs, and where and how they might mitigate it, as well as the human elements at work behind it.
Next-generation firewalls claim to identify application-layer attacks and enforce application-specific policies while delivering top-notch performance , even with advanced security features. However, the most common attacks that hackers use to get into an application—malware (e.g., spyware, Trojan horses, worms, etc. )—aren’t covered by most next-generation firewalls. How can a firewall defend against malware that bypasses it? Can it protect an application from a breach? What should an application’s security posture look like, and can a firewall be an application’s best defense? Let’s answer all these questions in this chapter.

From the raw , dance-punk rush of ADULT . to the stadium-sized anthems of Rüfüs du Sol , here are the songs that changed our lives . A lot of the time, we write about the music that made a major impact on us at the time of our birth or when we first encountered a band or artist that changed our lives. But there are plenty of artists and albums that made such a lasting impact, but we only really remember them after they've moved on. Sometimes, however, the impact was such that we find ourselves talking about the music long after it was made.

But even then, sharks will be looking to attack. Oh, and they're going to do all this while we're watching them on the TV screen. How is this a good idea?

Much of the music of the Western world is math : fractions and ratios , predictable patterns , calculable qualities . But when it comes to writing songs , that math often gets lost. The reason is that song is an organic thing. You don't force it. It grows and changes according to its natural cycles. The result is something unexpected and new , but also, in a way, unalterable . It's almost as though we have to write a new song every time we start out, because we're not allowed to use an old song's melody or lyrics as inspiration.

On the other side of the spectrum , some people , including some celebrities , have very high levels of self esteem .

A spacecraft launched from the Space Coast last year sped by Earth on Friday to `` borrow '' enough energy to slingshot past the moon, then head back to the planet a few hundred miles above. The flyby of the moon will happen on Monday, when Apollo 11's mission comes to an end after 43 days on the lunar surface. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Mike Collins left Earth last July 23 to make their ``last journey'' in human history. They landed near the Sea of Tranquillity on July 21.

Dylan Larkin never has won in Boston , and the last time the Red Wings played the Bruins at TD Garden, they lost to the Penguins . So, it was the perfect opportunity. There was no pressure because it was a game the Red Wings had no interest in playing. They had already clinched home-ice advantage in the Stanley Cup Playoffs and they had already clinched their division lead. But that's not why this game was significant. It was the chance to play the Bruins , who have been so difficult to play. It's the chance to win against them.

When the discovery of ‘ a new planet called Smiley ’ hit the headlines a month ago , it brought to light a curious fact . The new planet is only half as far away from its star as the planet Jupiter is from the Sun . Although we know a little more about Smiley than Jupiter does, the more we learn about it , the stranger it seems to be . The planet is the closest thing we have so far discovered to our own Sun , but it lacks a lot of our own planets’ features .
While the Tar Heels have been blown out ( by Georgia Tech , by Notre Dame ) , more often than not they have shown their toughness by coming back to win .

UNC came out like the scrappy team they are and came out with a vengeance. They played like it was the second half of a road game after being on a plane for three hours.
Jesus began his public ministry of teaching and healing in the synagogue on the Sabbath at Capernaum , and the synagogue was large. When Jesus finished healing everyone there, he went into the house of Simon the Leper. A woman who was demon-possessed by demons was brought to him.

He starts by introducing them to us.

The L.A. Film Festival is dabbling in television this year , showcasing two programs : AMC 's `` Breaking Bad '', premiering Sunday night, and NBC's `` Crisis , '' starring Blair Underwood . In a sense, I suppose it should be no surprise that L.A. wants to be on television. It's a hotbed of creativity, and the idea that we could become a national center of art and television production is pretty enticing. It's also a relatively young festival, and they haven't yet figured out what it's going to take to become a serious player in that field.

But that changed after her husband, Matt , left their home in Birmingham in May 2014 to move back to Wales."

THERE were times when last Sunday ’ s great G.O.P . health care implosion threatened to bring the thrill back to Republican politics. I thought of them as I watched the President’s presser on Monday. Not only did it provide him with something for which I’ve been waiting, the chance to declare victory, but I’ve been waiting to see whether he’d learned something from his experience with this fiasco, and whether he’d finally figured out that if he wants to save the country’s health care future, he had better do something with it now.

Richard Gowan is UNRWA's deputy special representative for Gaza and Ramallah. He was speaking to the BBC World Service's Business Daily programme in the wake of last weekend's Gaza-Israel clashes, where more than 120 Palestinians were killed. He says that in recent weeks, the situation has improved as a result of UNRWA's food and humanitarian assistance in Gaza. He says this is making people less likely to resort to armed conflict.
It does not seem too difficult for evolutionists to imagine that one species of life gradually adapted and changed into other species of life, if one only looks for the most primitive forms of life such as bacteria, fungi, or viruses. That is the Darwinist assumption. There is nothing wrong with this Darwinist idea. However, there are several problems with evolutionists’ explanations for how one species of life evolved into others. First of all, evolutionists have been forced to invent a large number of intermediary forms which they refer to as ‘missing link’ in order to prove that one species of life evolved from another.

So this list includes a lot of characters who eat in the manga and anime world. Some will be food related or they are just there so they will eat and we can see it, others are there just to make us feel like we are hungry and they have to eat. Some are even there just to have someone else feed them, but they are there anyway.

Spain ’ s high government bond yields are right where they should be given the country ’ s inflation outlook, which the Bank of Spain expects at 3.6% for 2013, down from last year ’ s 3.8%. The bank ’ s forecasts imply that Spain will not hit its target for 2013 inflation of 3%, which has been the objective of Spanish policy since December of last year. It has been a challenge for Spanish policy to reach that objective because the target for 2013 is well below the level of 5% that Spain had previously aimed at.

Thousands of people are expected to converge on Gravesend this weekend for the annual Sikh Vaisakhi festival . Another massive event is happening in London, however, where the British Sikh community is coming together to protest against racism and intolerance.

Today there are approximately 4.6m Sikhs worldwide, roughly 0.4m of which live in the UK. Over a week ago, I visited a friend in a south London Sikh temple where I found a community struggling to find its place within the British society.

The Supreme Court Monday allowed parts of President Donald Trump ’ s travel ban to go into effect and will rule on whether the rest can take effect in its next term starting this fall. The 6-3 ruling leaves in place the president’s March 6 executive order that bars travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. In his dissent from the court’s Monday ruling that parts of the order are in force, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was joined by the other conservative justices, said the court should have deferred to the president and the executive branch on foreign policy.

He later died in the hospital, days later, of internal injuries caused by the dog's attack."
"There ’ s a long list of reasons Matt Whitaker was an absurd choice for acting attorney general , but if there is one that cuts to the core of his lack of qualifications, it would have to be that he never served in the military . If, like me, you watched his confirmation hearing in January , you would have heard that Whitaker is not a former member of the armed forces. You would have heard his answer to Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) when Coons inquired about his service record :

Senator Coons: We ‘ ve all heard about your military service."

Vampires and werewolves are all abuzz as The Twilight Saga is all over the place and far from being complete.

Do You Want to Do What You Did Before … or Do You Want to Do Something Interesting ? Recently a friend and I talked about how, once you hit a certain career level, you have the choice of sticking with what you know, or making something else happen for yourself.

A 48-hour strike on October 19-20 was the biggest since the end of the Greek dictatorship in 1974 . Over a quarter of the population joined demonstrations in Athens , Thessaloniki , Ioannina , and Patras . This was not an ordinary strike. It is not the first that the working class has faced, nor is it the first by women workers. It has deep historical roots, in the struggles for national liberation that were fought during the decades following the dictatorship. This is not just a strike over working conditions, but rather part of a much more fundamental conflict about what sort of society we want.

With all the fanfare surrounding Microsoft ’ s reentry into telecom , I thought it worth mentioning Sun is doing some of the same things for broadband access. They don’t have quite the momentum or the size of Microsoft’s reach in telecom , but Sun has a lot of experience and a very successful product, the Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ). To understand why Sun would want to compete in telecom , you need to understand the economics of this space and understand how companies like Sun have historically behaved. What Is Sun’s History In Telecommunications?

Chronic constrictive pericarditis ( CP ) is a relatively rare condition in which the pericardium becomes fibrotic and noncompliant , resulting in the restriction of cardiac function and diastolic failure in affected individuals ([@b1]). The incidence, clinical manifestations, natural history, and response to therapy of CP remain poorly understood and poorly defined because most patients remain asymptomatic and have only subtle abnormalities on routine imaging studies ([@b2]). Therefore, CP remains an underdiagnosed condition, and the diagnosis is usually made incidentally in patients with advanced heart failure.

Congratulations , North Korea . You have just failed to put a satellite in orbit for the fourth time in a decade. Your record is impressive. Only two other nations have ever launched satellites into space. One of those nations is North Korea. The other is the Soviet Union, and they did that in 1965 and 1974. In the years since they first orbited a satellite, North Korea has had its own unique challenges. For the last two decades they have been locked in what has become one of the most bizarre armed conflict in the world.

This is a four-part blog series that I hope will help you be well-informed going into the public hearing on May 16th at City Hall, and beyond, about the future of our parks. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been in conversations where people ask me why the city should spend so much money on our parks.

This week we got a twofer : a story about race that got Rush Limbaugh and his toadies frothing at the mouth, and also a story about sex trafficking that got all three of the major presidential candidates frothing at the mouth. The reason for the latter frothing at the mouth is that all three of them have a personal stake in the outcome : the candidates are all married, and if it were up to their wives, none of them would be running for president. And, it turns out, the three of them are pretty well up to speed on how the other half lives.

In 2016 alone , over $4.3 billion of federal transportation funding was spent to repair America's structurally deficient bridges .

How many people are the average ? How can we be more than average ? Let's first look at how we measure . The standard measurement device for length is the meter, which is based on the standard distance between the earth and the moon."

"I read that some people believe that nuclear weapons are the best way to stanch the oil-well leak in the Gulf. I'd like to make the point that they're probably the *worst* way to stanch the oil leak, because they won't stop it for very long and will kill the Gulf's ecology. But I think that's a side-point:

What would be the best solution for the oil leak? Here's a few ideas, in no order of priority or feasibility (some of which will probably be impossible), but some would be easy to implement if the government wanted them badly enough."

This is a very fun show that you can have a lot of laughs with. Cons: Can be a tad too silly at times. Can also be very cliche at times. Can be a little too much of a sitcom sometimes. I don’t know if there’s much else that I could say about it that people wouldn’t have already said. Bottom Line: I can see why people are liking this show as much as I am."

Does decarbonisation inevitably mean de-industrialisation ? Ecological disasters in the EU : Can new technologies save lives ? Over the last century we have made a lot of mistakes in our relationship with nature, but we do have tools to rectify them. We should use them. In a climate change and ecology debate we often encounter a concept called ‘ecological modernisation’. The idea is that industrialisation brought about ecological destruction, and now industrialisation’s replacement is ecological modernisation, and that if we want to reduce ecological destruction we have to bring about ecological modernisation.
What do you do when a 200-ton rock renders your road impassable ? Blow it up , of course . And in this instance, you do so by shooting a missile at it and watching it explode in a puff of dust. And as far as getting there is concerned: you may as well have flown the thing. And if you have the money and can afford a nuclear-powered rocket, then you should be getting a seat on NASA's Orion spacecraft , which, once it lands on the Moon , will be ferrying passengers.
A La Presse journalist expressed dismay Tuesday after learning that the RCMP were planning to shadow him in hopes he might lead the agency to a suspect in a $1.1-million Quebec City house break-in. “I thought they were trying to intimidate me.

Nothing Says `` Horror '' Like `` Wii Balance Board '' The Wii Balance Board might not get much exercise, but if used right, it can be an integral part of a killer app. It seems like I can do a lot more things these days.

Back then, I could never imagine myself on an elliptical trainer or doing any of the above activities with a Nintendo Wii Balance Board.

The flu bug got the best of Henry Clay , but so did Paul Dunbar . In a matchup of titans, it was Clay who emerged victorious as the New Orleans Saints won their seventh game in a row and continued on the road to the postseason for the 18th straight season.

“ I HAVEN ’ T paid an electricity bill since 1970 , ” says Richard Perez with noticeable glee . He may not have paid one , but he certainly hasn ’ t owed one either . Perez hasn ’ t been an unpaid bill victim since he was a kid, and his generation of kids hasn ’ t been either. That is , until about six months ago, when the bills started rolling in. But Perez is no victim. He has worked as an electrician since the ’ 60s — for a power company, an independent contractor and now for the city of Austin .
Rival firms Samsung and Apple have struck a partnership deal that will see a new iTunes Movies and TV Shows store launched in South Korea in the near future.

A lot of gamers have the unfortunately incorrect idea that “ censorship ” is any time anyone changes anything about a video game. This isn't true. Censorship is when a person changes something about the game. Like, a video game developer changes a character’s race to make her more like a character of the same race the developer prefers. That is “censorship.” If a person changes the color of a background or an object to make the video game look like something he prefers, that’s not censorship. Censorship is making changes that affect gameplay.
The two snogged right after Ryan Gosling beat out Reynolds for best actor in a comedy—a subtle callback to another great film, where snogging is a major theme of the movie, and even more of an act of rebellion, an act of resistance to the patriarchal culture of Hollywood. As it turns out, I was at Sundance with Ryan, and I have to say I never saw the snogging coming, even though we all knew that one was coming. He was a good boy and he didn't even try to sneak it in!

When it comes to the security of the Internet of Things , a lot of the attention has focused on the software that runs on devices. However, a new report says that hardware makers are actually the biggest threat to IoT connectivity. The new report, titled “Internet of Dangers: The State of IoT Security”, published this week by the SANS institute, points to IoT devices as the most vulnerable to hackers. IoT devices, or “things”, are connected devices, such as cameras and refrigerators, and the report cites vulnerabilities in the embedded software that controls them.

I do, but that’ s not really what I do there. I don’t want to talk about the headlines that have been rattling my cage lately, or even the headlines that are rattling it right now, because they’d be the headlines of any day, and most of us have more than one source of outrage to choose from."
Major league baseball This baseball season belonged to just one person . Orel Leonard Hershiser IV . Singing hymns in a church in San Bernardino, California, on June 29, 1992, the California Angels were on the verge of clinching the American League West division championship for the third straight year.

Jones had just finished directing her first ever feature, ‘A Girl on Fire’, which tells the story of a rebellious young woman who leaves behind everything to follow her own dreams.

When you enter Mark Suchocki 's smithy set in the woods of Royalston at the end of a winding path through pine and maple, you're met by the sight of what appears to be a wall of fire. But there's nothing to see but an enormous circular metal anvil, its inner and outer surfaces charred to a rippling red glow. A few steps away is his forge, a metal pit set into the ground that looks like a deep-fat fryer from the outside. Inside, such equipment is used to shape steel into blades, axes, and other weapons.

"Does it really matter whether racist LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling is a registered Democrat ? Or a Republican ? Or if he's even a member of one of the two parties? The truth is, regardless of which party you're a member of or lean toward, there's only one party that can save us from this mess. And that party is a third party. Yes, a third party. There's no way you can say you're for ""fairness"" in America today and not be a third party. So how does it even matter if Donald Sterling is a registered Republican?"

I understand where the buses come from to shuttle passengers on trains when the train routes have problems . But this is not going to be sustainable . People are going to be paying $50 dollars to be picked up and transported to the next train station when their trains don't even have a fixed route . And where are people suppose to be able to find $50 dollars to make up the difference ? On top of that they could have used more trains. For example, instead of 1 train a day each way , they could have used 2 trains a day each way , thus freeing up 2 buses .

If you ’ ve ever got a leaky phone that won t charge , then you know exactly how I feel when it ’ s time to give my iPhone a bath .

"2016 : Funniest political year ever ? Trump ’ s cabinet picks and entertaining paroxysms of left-wing losers vindicated once-hesitant conservatives in 2016

We've said it before and we'll be saying it again: 2016 was the worst year of our lifetime for conservatives. Yes, it was painful. We lost a good chunk of the leadership team in the Senate during a year when conservatives were in the majority in the House of Representatives. We lost presidential candidate Ben Carson to an early-onset case of reality. We lost former House Speaker John Boehner to an even later onset of dementia."

One said he and his colleagues were contacted by Mr Banks in the summer of last year when Mr Farage was launching the Brexit Party.

They were wrong . Yes , the $ 40 wine came in first place . But the $ 5 wine was right behind it. And the $ 2 wine was the last one to be sold. What was the difference? It was the price per unit that mattered. Let's see what you can get for just $ 2 . You have two choices , a bottle of Coke or a carton of milk. What would you choose? If we asked this question , you wouldn't say Coke over milk because Coke is more expensive . It's because milk is more convenient .
I think it is safe to say that humans are definitely better than Google 's self-driving cars when it comes to learning from past mistakes and taking action to prevent a similar accident from happening again, but Google 's self-driving cars are far from perfect when it comes to learning from previous mistakes. At this point, it is hard to deny that Google 's cars have caused more accidents than Tesla Motors , and a few of these accidents involved the death or injury of one of the self-driving car's occupants. These accidents have left Google 's self-driving cars to face some very tough questions.

CRN rounded up the 10 signs of telecom turmoil as carriers realize it might be time to return to their core businesses. What is happening is not surprising. We have been forecasting for years that the carriers were heading back to the drawing boards, not that they ever really left, and here we are. That said, we still think it will be at least a year and a half before service will be restored, if at all. And, once it does, there is the potential for another two years or more to see what comes next.

Cash—and even checks—may have come back into vogue since the Target security mess , but the example being set by Target is not how to get back in the game. According to experts, you should do everything you can to keep your data off-site and encrypted.

But the incident serves as yet another lesson in the risks of storing sensitive information on-premises instead of storing it off-site and encrypted.

A reputed Aurora street gang member 's attempted-murder conviction was reversed outright by an Illinois Appellate Court 2nd District judicial panel. The convicted gang member had claimed that he was denied his right to a jury trial due to ineffective legal representation.

What the beckoning words did not immediately convey was the existence of a towering mountain range : the forbidding Sierra del Diablo. There were no tracks, no paths, no road signs to direct the wayfarer, and no guideposts. The only sign of life to be seen was an occasional human face peering out of a tent, as if on guard. We had no choice, so we chose to go on. Travelling without any form of navigational aid meant that we found ourselves lost in the most spectacular mountainscape the world can offer.

CEDAR RAPIDS , Iowa ( AP ) — Back in Iowa as a full-fledged presidential candidate , Democrat Elizabeth Warren made one of the most compelling pitches of the 2016 cycle: an argument that America is becoming an oligarchy , with an increasingly smaller number of people controlling a much bigger share of the country's wealth . It was a message that resonated powerfully with voters and made her a rising national star among Democrats. But Warren has largely avoided the topic since she launched her campaign last year — even as Republicans have revived it to try and scare voters about her ideas.

National Hurricane Conference in Orlando stresses how Matthew , Harvey , Irma and Maria challenged forecasting and preparations . If Matthew had been more like a typical hurricane, forecasters would have predicted that his track could have been predicted and preparations made, but Matthew was more complicated because of the complex interaction with the Gulf Stream. This led forecasters to underestimate the hurricane's size, making it the strongest storm of Category 5 in the Atlantic since Felix in 2007. Forecasters did not expect that it would be a big storm and underestimated its wind speed.

Forget all that stuff about `` jury nullification '' and racial divisions as the reason O.J . Simpson was acquitted. In fact, the reason the former football great was acquitted -- or, to be precise, why the trial ended without an acquittal verdict -- had nothing to do with any racial prejudices. In the eyes of a judge and the 12 jurors who deliberated for two months, Simpson was simply not guilty of any of the charges, despite a mountain of evidence pointing to his guilt on all of them. And so the trial went.

Luckily for the Indiana Pacers , the five seed in the NBA Playoffs is a good spot to be in, with a chance to rest players in the second round.

In its analysis the IFS said spending on schools, hospitals, roads and the police could increase by up to £6.4bn next year - and that overall funding for the UK's public sector could rise by a further £7bn. That is equivalent to about 3 per cent of gross domestic product. In an analysis of where the government could borrow from to fund public spending, it says borrowing will increase by £8.6bn next year and by a further £9bn in 2015. This is equivalent to about 3% of GDP.

In fact, he's so reticent that one might think he doesn't know how to be charming. The Prince is trying to put his life into perspective before our interview, and he seems a little lost."

"England may have landed in the ‘ Group of Death ’ when the draw was made for the early stages of the 2014 World Cup

Group D consists of the best four teams, but is probably the most volatile group of the whole tournament so far. From the four, two teams have already had a chance at winning the title: Spain and Italy, with the first game a must-win for Spain. Germany and France have already played and drawn in the group, with both sides sitting pretty in second place in their groups. The two nations are also likely to clash in the semi-finals should they meet."

Ramirez, a four-time All-Star, has been on the disabled list for four weeks with a fractured right thumb. He had surgery last Monday. �I am very happy because I will have the opportunity to have another surgery,� he said in Spanish through a translator. �This means that the injury was not so complicated that I needed the operation. It was a problem of the cartilage, and that was the problem.�

Ramirez has played in only 12 games since the All-Star break."
AWW , who ’ s a widdle planet , then ? Astronomers have got their first glimpse at baby worlds orbiting a nearby star. The results are surprising and surprising to say the least. The infant worlds are so young, they would be just a few billion years old. But their size, mass and location suggest they may have spent most of the early stages of their existence at the same distance from their star that they now occupy — which is a good thing, as otherwise they ’d be roasted to death. If confirmed, this is the first discovery of protoplanets beyond our solar system.
Tim Parker for The New York TimesLeisa Zigman , an anchor at KSDK , a Gannett-owned television station in St. Louis, has had a long career in journalism, but her career came to an abrupt, and humiliating, end earlier this year when her employer cut off her pay and benefits and fired her, apparently for being pregnant and out of work. Like many other media workers, Zigman said, she was shocked by her employer’s action. The station is part of Gannett, a media company that owns a number of papers and other outlets and is owned by the publishing company of Mr. Peabody and Mr. Sherman.
The 5,160-square-foot , brick ranch-style home includes floor-to-ceiling windows throughout . A west-side Sioux Falls topped our metro home sales in November at $245 per square foot. That is down 7.5 percent year over year, but still the strongest month in over a decade. Rising home prices have also made home ownership more affordable for a wide range of income levels. There were 18 home sales in November. The average sales price increased 7.7 percent to $245,988. Sellers were more than half the homes in the market at the start of November, so there were fewer new listings and more sales.

In the years since then , the country has had several leaders who were toppled by the Iranian people.
"Investors who want to buy stocks should do so in the U.S. , concentrating on domestically focused smaller to mid-sized companies. Investors have lost more than half of their U.S. stock market wealth since the 2007-2009 market downturn, but that's not necessarily a reason to invest in foreign markets, according to an annual survey of foreign stock markets by the Bank of Canada. ""It's not that Canada is more risky,"" says senior economist Douglas Porter. ""You don't want to put too much emphasis on Canada when you think of investing in the stock market."""

When my dad ended his life , it felt like I arrived somewhere I had always been headed . I knew what I had been feeling and doing the past few days , and it felt like a big relief to finally stop trying to make sense of it , and just be. I don’t think I have ever fully accepted what happened, but I accept it, I know I am ok now. I am still sad, but there are moments where I don’t think about it. I think I’m learning to not feel bad about that.
Philadelphia 's police union issued a scathing rebuke of Hillary Clinton for including relatives of victims of police shootings at a public event on Saturday, while also praising Donald Trump as a “great candidate” for the presidency. Philadelphia’s union leaders called Clinton an “empty suit” in a statement posted on the website of their Fraternal Order of Police. They said Clinton and her allies were trying to manipulate the public’s perception of the city’s police force – by using the victims’ relatives – to distract from issues that should concern all Americans.

Forward Martin Erat, who had been expected to be a top-six contributor, underwent surgery Wednesday to remove an orbital bone fracture that kept him off the ice for the remainder of the playoffs, but is expected to be ready for training camp next fall. General Manager David Poile had initially said after Game 3 that there wasn’t anything he could do about Erat’s injury, but added that it could be a “possibility” he could return in time for training camp.

Nidal Hasan, 43, of Silver Spring, Md., claims he didn't use his government-issued M4 service rifle to kill 13 people and wounded more than 30 others at the Texas Army post.

- Erin Tomkins was 23 months old when she was rushed to Sheffield Children ’ s Hospital by ambulance on April 20, 2008 after she started choking on a chocolate biscuit. But it took five hours for doctors to diagnose a rare condition which was preventing Erin from breathing. Now a year later, the family, from the Sheffield area, have spoken about what has happened to their daughter since her condition was finally diagnosed. And they are urging parents and teachers to learn about and look out for ‘hidden’ signs in young children that can point to life-threatening conditions.
Child care . Rent . Food . Transit . Across the board , Torontonians are being hammered by the rising cost of living — and it has a significant impact on their children's health and well-being .

As previously established ( and established and established ) , Hollywood is not a fun place for females—especially aging females. As they become older, they’ve been cast as witches, villains, crazy old hags, witches in training, evil matriarchs, villains in training, and many other types of villainous witches, and their roles are mostly played by older actresses. This is something that most of the actresses I’ve worked with have said they never would do. And that’s just one of the many reasons why I love working in film, television, and theater.
November 16 , 2011 ( WASHINGTON ) — At the end of a two-day workshop on peace in Darfur held in the Sudanese capital Khartoum, participants said that the United Nations should focus on ending the conflict in Darfur, while other African nations also need to take a greater role in ending their own conflicts, including Somalia, Cote d’Ivoire and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). But participants also said it would be better if the UN did not directly support peacekeeping operations, because that would allow it to distance the organization from the problems they were trying to solve on the ground in West Darfur.
A political impasse over Oregon 's budget troubles continued this month , following the end of a second special legislative session that was called late last year in hopes of averting major cuts to state services . The Legislature ended its session earlier this month without enacting new budget laws. Instead, lawmakers voted to place the matter on a special election ballot. The ballot measure will be submitted to Oregon voters in June. If approved, the plan would raise taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals through new taxes and fees. The measure would also increase the state sales tax, increase income taxes for some and create new taxes on certain businesses.
HOLIDAYMAKERS have been left furious after one of the UK 's largest tour operators added a surcharge of up to 80 per cent to their holiday bookings during the peak of the school holidays - without telling customers. And they have raised fears that other holiday companies are doing the same. The surcharge, which appeared on travel agents' websites on Thursday, came into force for travel to the UK from October 1, and affected all tour operator customers who booked a package holiday during August. Bookers claim that in some cases, operators added the price hikes to holiday packages without asking their customers to pay the increased costs.

Why do some feel their public imposition of personal values is justified on this issue ? The Canadian province of Quebec is one example. It is governed by the current separatist government and, for a variety of reasons, is known as one of Quebec’s most conservative provinces. This is a province in which abortion has been a divisive and politically charged issue for as long as I can recall. For most of the last century, the Catholic church held considerable sway over the moral and political issues that confront the province.

Nurses and doctors in Irish hospitals have been urged not to call patients “ love ” or “ dear ” because the use of words such as these can be perceived as being “ gender-biased ”. In a document published by the National Union of General Practitioners ( NUGP ), it is recommended that healthcare providers avoid the use of terms such as love, dear, darling, sweetheart and honey. “These words can be gender-biased as they can suggest that the speaker regards the patient or recipient as being a particular gender or as a person in a particular gender role,” the NUGP report says.
"It 's a grab-bag of transit systems that all operate separately in an increasingly-connected metro Atlanta region . ATLANTA -- For more than 100 years, the world 's largest airport has been known as Hartsfield-Jackson . That nickname comes with a long list of accolades.

Yet if you've seen Watson play in the PGA, he's just another guy on the course. ""I don't want to hear about it,"" says Watson. ""I don't care what that car cost, that's nothing."

The volleyball season came to an end last Tuesday afternoon for the Blue Devils of Springside Chestnut Hill Academy , and to say the Dukes' season was not a successful one would not be an overstatement. With an 8-24 record, the Dukes failed to make the post-season playoffs, finishing in eighth place in Class 2A. The last two years, they've had back to back 10-win campaigns, so this year's record was a step down, but the Dukes are looking to rebound in 2011-12. The Blue Devils had a very young team this season, but it was not entirely their fault.

The home side’s Grand Slam heroics have been brought to an abrupt end. Wales crashed out of the 2019 Six Nations at home against France on Friday (AEDT).

"In 2016 , when demanding that the Senate vote on Merrick Garland , President Barack Obama 's Supreme Court nominee, the Democrats said that a president's nominee was the Supreme Court, not the next president's. When Republicans said that an elected president deserved a Supreme Court, the Democrats said that a nominee was only a placeholder until the new president's pick was confirmed. When the Republicans said that a Democratic president's nominee was not the Court, the Democrats said, ""No, no, no -- it's a nominee."""

Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel spoke during a press conference Thursday and revealed that the armed school resource officer never drew his weapon or fired it, but was holding a gun while a fellow officer was trying to get in. At the heart of it, Israel says he believes that Broward County School Resource Officer Scot Peterson is a coward, but also a good officer and a well-respected member of the Broward County Sheriff's Office. The officer has been charged with child neglect, for failing to act when he heard shots and realized the students were under attack.

Police say the gunman is a black male wearing a black hoodie, black pants and a dark jacket."
When official word arrived that Axl Rose 's decade-overdue opus Chinese Democracy would finally see release this year , we weren't exactly shocked. Not after all the delays and postponements , plus the fact that one of rock's most polarizing figures had promised the world that this was the end of the line. When we got a glimpse of it in December, it still looked like any other rock album: overstuffed , full of guest musicians, a little messy at times. All told, we didn't know exactly what this record was going to be until now.

The commotion over Louisana ’ s Common Core testing standards reached the St. Landry Parish School Board last week , and some of the comments left in the meeting were pretty shocking to me. First , there are people who think it’s ok to punish a child because the test is too hard , that it’s okay to blame a child for being unprepared. It’s as if the test is so hard , a student can only fail. Second , there are some people who seem to think that a standardized testing is a magic wand that solves all the educational problems of the school system.

PARIS , Aug 31 ( Reuters ) – A deal was reached on Monday to save hundreds of ferry jobs in the French region of Brittany, as thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of cities nationwide in a show of public anger at the government’s tax on the wealthy. The deal came hours before a deadline for a strike by ferry operators to be averted after a two-week strike crippled Brittany’s main port of St Malo. Under the terms of the deal brokered with the port’s management, union leaders will get 2,500 workers out of a total of 5,700 who would have taken part in strike action.

"Northern Michigan 's abundance of white pine and other popular woods created a timber boom in the late 19th century. White pine dominated this region, and lumber was shipped throughout the Great Lakes, as far as the South. White pine was used to build the decks, houses, docks, wharves, schools, and other buildings. After the timber was depleted, logging in this region continued in other types of wood such as red pine, spruce and balsam. Logging is still the dominant industry in White Pine County. Today's industry
The region's industry today is dominated by a small group of family-owned timber companies."

Your favorite shop or restaurant in downtown Knoxville is probably doing well . Downtown Knoxville 's retail shops and restaurants have benefited from the new Tennessee Valley Authority power plant being built near the city's western edge at Rivergate. One of the reasons for the increased prosperity of the city's downtown core is that it is within walking distance for residents. In the past, most residents of Knoxville and its western suburbs relied on their cars for getting around the city; however, times have changed and residents of the city are taking advantage of the nearby shops and restaurants.

A new poll shows Americans do not approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing and believe the justices are making up their own law. The new survey is the latest in a series of polls showing just how far behind the court is from the approval rating it held at its peak when it was viewed in positive light as a way to save the court. The poll by Gallup found that a majority of Americans disapprove of the court. Fifty percent said they disapprove of the work of the court, while 41 percent approve, the poll found.
The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government ’ s education reforms are overhauling extensive spending on initiatives , numerous collaborations and concentrated capacity-building and technical support in its province in the past four years. In recent months, some of them have been hit with controversies that raise questions about how far these reforms will proceed. KP Education Department Secretary Syed Aqeel Jamal said these reforms were the “largest and the most comprehensive overhaul” the province had ever seen. According to Aqeel Jamal, the province would spend Rs6.7 billion on the reforms in the upcoming fiscal year, which starts next month.
A `` Ludacris '' idea -- free cars . Move over Oprah and Ty Pennington -- you 're not the only ones giving away free stuff. It may sound like a gimmick at first, but it could also be a real game changer. The car-giving phenomenon has taken over the U.S. as more and more Americans give away their free-floating money -- be it by going without groceries or paying rent -- to local charities. It's also a boon to car dealers who give away hundreds of free cars each year at shows and charity events and it helps the charities raise funds.
CHASKA , Minn. – The PGA of America has altered its approach to the Ryder Cup with the tournament returning to venues where the U.S. Open is played the same weekend. As a result, players such as Jason Dufner, Brandt Snedeker, Bubba Watson, Jim Furyk and Dustin Johnson – who would not play in the biennial competition at Hazeltine National Golf Club in the Twin Cities this week – will have to wait one more year to defend the Cup at Bellerive, S.C.

According to reports , a strike on June 25 killed ISIS 's deputy war minister , Basim Muhammad Ahmad Sultan al-Bahlawi. al-Bahlawi was the group's top strategist on military and political affairs. His death will leave the Islamic State in Syria and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS and ISIS) without a top figure to guide their military strategy in Syria. He was responsible for the group's takeover of northern Iraq in June 2014 after it was expelled from other parts of Iraq. In April 2015, al-Bahlawi was appointed the group's military commander of the self-declared caliphate (Caliph) of the Islamic State.
Come Tuesday night , the Red Sox will be back at Fenway Park , where they own a 42-29 record since the start of 2018 . And just like a couple of years ago , the Sox’s bats will be heating up. In fact , it seems they’re on the verge of one of those seasons — which is to say, you can pencil the Red Sox in for a top-three playoff seed after a month of baseball — and they’ll be doing it without the reigning AL MVP . That’s the way it works sometimes.

Not a perfect year for wind and solar , but a better year than coal had . In 2017 , coal use was down for the first time in years . Wind and solar have become a very important part of our energy mix . They will not solve the problem alone , but they are becoming important . The growth of both will be slower in the future , but their importance in the long run will grow . And they will keep growing as long as we can find ways to store energy , which we are improving . The growth of renewables will slow from 2017 to 2022 .
Though the United States and the United Kingdom receive the most widespread criticism for supplying weapons to the Saudi government in its military campaign in Yemen, Israel has become another major military supplier of the coalition which has been bombing the impoverished country for over three years. The United Kingdom and France have also supplied arms to the Saudis. The United States has not commented on the sale of arms from the United Kingdom, and France has only done so for the last month. Israel’s arms trade with the Saudi Arabian regime, however, has been in the spotlight for the past decade.
All British troops involved in fatal incidents during the Troubles in Northern Ireland are to face a fresh criminal investigation into their deaths. An inquiry led by Lord Chief Justice Sir Patrick Maynard QC is expected to examine whether soldiers used excessive force in the deaths of a man shot by troops on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in 1972 and a soldier gunned down during a loyalist riot in 1993. It is also expected to investigate three other deaths in the early 1970s – the killing of two civilians by soldiers in the Dungiven ambush and the shooting of a woman by the SAS in Co Fermanagh in 1972.

A local reporter who covered the `` resurrection service '' still marvels at the media turnout . It 's a miracle. I don 't remember getting the same kind of response when I covered the presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton. As I walked up the sidewalk to get into the church, I saw a number of national and regional media already in place in the narthex of the cathedral to await the appearance of Pope Francis. This is a rare occurrence, even for an international event of this significance . The cathedral was nearly full when I entered.
Trump ’ s excuses and justifications for his performance in Helsinki were almost as bad as the debacle itself . His performance was worse than his performance in front of the American people at the White House on Monday. His performance was one thing, while his excuses in front of the media on Wednesday was another. The performance of the president on Monday was nothing less than a complete embarrassment. The excuse he gave on Wednesday is nothing less than a complete farce, and it’s a farce made up of a series of lies which he is trying to pass off as reality.
I am dismayed by the comments Pope Francis made about the murders at Charlie Hebdo earlier this month . His words show a dangerous tendency to conflate those who have different opinions about Christianity and the state, and to equate those who advocate a more secular state with the Nazis. There’s an old adage that when the left and the right agree on anything, it means they are both wrong. I don’t believe that. In fact, I don’t think that’s even true. There are some things we can agree upon and that is the need for tolerance.

Holiday hiring is underway with many retailers looking for seasonal and temporary employees . The National Retail Federation expects seasonal hiring to peak in January this year for holiday shoppers. Retail job fairs have become a popular way to source employees. The number of these fairs has more than tripled from 2009, according to the Retail Action Project, a research and advocacy group for the industry. Last year, about 1,400 retail job fairs were held, and in 2010, the total was more than 4,300. Fairfield County is home to some of the nation’s largest retail job fairs.
AsiaNews talks to a group of Iraqi Christians who are back in Italy after a long visit to northern Iraq. A few months ago, the Italian group “L'Aquila per la pace” (LAP) went to Iraq and spent six months in Kurdistan, helping Iraqi Christians. The visit was a continuation of similar projects in the past, but this time a different group accompanied the Iraqi Christians. A few months before the trip to Iraq, two young men from northern Italy who are friends of the LAP group went there for the first time.
Jock Reynolds , an art curator who graduated from UC Davis with an MFA , will speak Saturday about the future of art in a world undergoing massive upheaval. The talk takes place as the nation is in the throes of the most contentious presidential election in recent memory, a debate between two candidates who hold deeply divergent worldviews on how the U.S. should shape its future. In this year’s Presidential Election, many have pointed to Donald Trump’s embrace of the so-called alt-right movement and his inflammatory comments about Muslims as the reason his candidacy has gained traction.

Technology and petroleum-linked shares were among the winners on Tuesday as US stocks shrugged off trade worries and finished higher after a weak jobs report was offset by solid factory data and solid corporate earnings. US stocks rose, with the Nasdaq and Dow industrials trading higher by 1.4% and 0.8%, while the S&P 500 gained 2.2% and the Nasdaq was up 2.4% as of late afternoon. All three indexes fell sharply on Monday after the Trump administration imposed 10% steel and 10% aluminum tariffs against the EU, Canada and Mexico and threatened to do the same with China.

With Donald Trump ’ s emergence as the likely Republican Presidential nominee , the question remains so how will “the American Taliban” react to his victory. The obvious answer to this question is that we will see an explosion of violence and lawlessness from the likes of Timothy McVeigh and Ted Bundy . However, in my estimation , we should not assume that there will be a rash of mass acts of terror as we might see if the Republican nominee wins. The reason is that the political environment in America has changed dramatically as a consequence of the economic recession that started in late 2007.
To The Editor : A Sunday Times-News letter writer espoused how much more content the Dutch are than we Americans, but when it comes right down to it we have more content. The first thing that strikes me as being different in the Dutch approach to life, is the content of people. It is not as shallow, the average Dutch person, is not as self absorbed, it seems to me, in the Dutch. It’s hard to describe, but I know I have felt the difference in my own life.
After the way the first half of the season went for Hibs , it has been a very good achievement that they are in the top four, especially as it’s all done on merit. The team has performed well in difficult circumstances, particularly with the injuries sustained to some key personnel, and it’ll be great to see how they perform at this stage. The team is made up of young players and a couple of older players who are doing a job that they weren’t doing when they were in the team two years ago, and there’s not a lot of room for error.
While his life may not be like that of the average New Yorker , President Donald Trump has countless ties to the city, including multiple golf courses, a large luxury apartment building, a helicopter pad, and now a Trump-branded golf course in the Dominican Republic that will open this year. As a city, the U.S. population is growing at its slowest pace in over 20 years. The city is becoming more diverse, with New York as the nation’s largest minority population, and there has been a decrease in crime and poverty.
The cost of bringing up a child from birth to their 21st birthday has jumped to £180,137 , a study suggests.

WHITTIER – It was a day that Teresa Moore hoped would not come . She and 20 other members of a Whittier-area church are suing their former pastor over abuse that occurred in his role as their spiritual leader from 1985 until 2009. Moore, now 60, and the women say their allegations against the now-dead Rev. William E. Shafer include forced confessions, sleep deprivation, being drugged, and physical and emotional abuse. Moore, who was 17 when she met Shafer, says she first noticed something was off during her freshman year at Central Christian Church in 1985 when she heard that Shafer was her pastor.

L.A.-based design duo Brian Wolk and Claude Morais worked with power stylist Elizabeth Stewart on their eponymous line Wolk Morais. The duo's goal was not only to design beautiful pieces but also create a line of products that were useful. To this end, each line features a range of items such as handbag covers, shoe liners and hand warmers. I first discovered their line on the runway a couple of seasons ago and have since found a home for their handbags in my closet. I also have a set of the shoe liners at home to help keep my feet warm during the coldest months of the winter.
As the Prime Minister takes aim at capitalism , chief executives should play an active part in the debate to make sure that the policies which they support are fit for purpose. This will ensure that they can compete effectively in the new, low carbon economy and contribute to growth. Capitalism was developed in Europe in the late Middle Ages. The Industrial Revolution created a new economy, and it took another century to build a new kind of economic and social order in the West. It took longer for Eastern Europe, China and India to develop.
California 's oil regulatory agency acknowledged in a report Thursday that it has consistently failed to oversee oil operations in a way that properly protects California residents from oil drilling and spills. The report was written by the state's Air Resources Board, which has spent years trying to address the problem of air quality in oil and gas extraction areas in the Monterey Bay and Los Angeles regions. The report states the board's staff has reviewed thousands of pages of federal, state and tribal reports, conducted hundreds of interviews and taken numerous air quality measurements at oil and gas extraction sites across the state.

"Yvonne VillarrealVillarreal is a Times staff writer . Downtown L.A. 's one-way streets and narrow roadways are often hard to navigate for non-L.A. traffic. ""People are always confused about whether to turn right, left or straight ahead at red lights, and many don't like having to stop at green lights, even though it's safer to do so, or at least safer than not stopping at all,"" Villarreal said. The city's downtown streets, which have been rebuilt in a grid-like fashion starting in the 1970s, are also difficult to navigate for drivers, especially those who drive large vehicles, like trucks."
A new generation fights for our rights 20 years after one of the nation 's most infamous antigay hate crimes — and what can you do to ensure they aren 't ignored, denied or punished? When I was 10, my brother and I were on the phone together. It was a rare occurrence; most often, when my parents were out of the house, my older brother John and I would argue over what he was going to get for lunch or whether or not we would have to clean his room. We were 10-year-old twins, and we liked to test our limits, but we were also close friends.

Enterprises need tools that work together -- even among competing products . Cloud-based work management and collaboration tools are now widely used in business, but what about in the legal world? In this post we'll talk about some of the leading legal work management (WMS) and collaboration platforms. I don't think there is a single WMS platform that all enterprises need, but rather a wide variety that address a variety of enterprise business requirements. I've decided to break up this post into a couple of posts, with each post focusing on one particular tool.

The Xoom tablet has a respectably fast Verizon 3G connection , but Motorola promises a free upgrade to Verizon 's 4G LTE network within 6 months of purchase, so we'd like to know whether you plan to buy one in the near future.

In December 1996 , a wealthy yet little-known Pompey supporter by the name of Iain McInnes dug deep into his personal funds to secure the purchase of a one-third stake in Fratton Park. This move would become the catalyst for the creation of Pompey in the late-1990’s, a football club to reflect the personality of McInnes. Over the years, I’ve been a fan of Pompey. I supported the Blues when they had their heyday in the late 70’s through to the mid-90’s and then became a fan of the reserve team at Fratton Park.

its maps mostly remind us of our instinctual fixation on knowing our physical whereabouts . the earliest map-makers tried to convey the idea of the earth's surface as it appeared to the human eye by representing land masses and oceans with a single color, such as red for land and white for water (fig. 5.1). The red-and-white color palette was later replaced by other hues as a means of distinguishing between types and regions of land and water. Red is a natural color choice for depicting water, but in most regions today, the ocean is actually teal, a pale blue.

Here are the strengths and weaknesses of Nicolas Maduro and Juan Guaido , both of whom claim to be the leader of Venezuela . Who’s right? There is plenty of room for error in assessing these two men, but the basic facts are clear. Mr. Maduro is the president of Venezuela , while Mr. Guaido is an opposition legislator who is calling for the ouster of Mr. Maduro on the grounds that he is not legitimately elected and is therefore not the rightful president of Venezuela . Mr. Guaido argues that in order to restore democracy in Venezuela , he is now the country’s legitimate leader.

World oil production stagnated between 2005 and 2007 , which given rapid growth in demand from emerging economies sent oil prices through the roof from around $20 a barrel in 2003 to as much as $150 a barrel by the end of 2008 . In 2010, oil production rose back to pre-2008 levels at around 87 million barrels per day, a level which was maintained until 2015 , but is currently rising again. However, with oil demand still rising at a relatively fast rate, this rise in production hasn't been sufficient to offset this demand.

The Netherlands is the host of the Winter Olympic Games from February 9-25, but this nation of 17 million people also plays a vital role in hockey. The Netherlands has won the World Cup in both men and women’s competitions four times since 1995. It has been the top-ranked team in the world since 2009. As such, it is no surprise that a number of top hockey players are from the Netherlands."
In a 2010 talk , TED curator Chris Anderson describes the concept of “ crowd-accelerated innovation ” —a self-fueling cycle in which a new invention, initially made by just a few individuals, is quickly amplified by the collective imagination of the internet, which in turn attracts a new generation of inventors to create a new product. The cycle is self-reinforcing; a new idea, when shared with a community of like-minded people, often becomes the basis for an even more successful product. This idea, as we see it, is now playing out all across the tech industry.

If there was a single moment that marked the introduction and establishment of the United States as a significant world power during the Cold War, it would have to be that of the United Nations founding conference in San Francisco in 1945. This meeting was an important milestone not only because it was attended by all the Allied powers and the Soviet Union, but also because all the permanent members of the General Assembly were represented.

Papa Hemingway ! Where Are the Men ? Daniel Manus Pinkwater , one of the two or three last great English-language fictionists of the generation before our own, is to have a small and special book published in his memory. I wonder if it will do. I hope so. I am not sure, because there is no precedent to go by and nothing to check on. It is not even certain that Pinkwater was right about himself and his own times. And so there is the question of whether, if a man like Pinkwater can't get it right about himself, can he get it right about others?

"LIVERPOOL will hold their staff Christmas party in the city ’ s Titanic Hotel this week . Whatever else is happening in the club, the staff will be treated like royalty for a day, thanks to the generosity of owner John Moores. This is Moores ’ ’ big idea.

In this installment of By The Numbers , I’ll walk through some of the interesting numbers I found when looking into his playing time.

THE news that many youngsters no longer experience the traditional pleasures of playing conkers or picking blackberries – or would if they had the opportunity – is greeted with mixed emotions. In some ways it's a sad indictment of our children, and yet it also gives us great pleasure that we are raising them to live more sustainably. For all our children's access to information, for all the schools' eco-activism, it's clear that we are facing a new generation of eco-pioneers. Whether they know it or not, they are learning about, and in some cases engaging in, the practice of sustainability.

Regarding your May 26 article `` Whose edifice is this ? Spain peels back the layers of its identity '' ( Opinion, May 26): How much of your opinion is written by a member of the Spanish Communist Party ? In your article you correctly point out the problems faced by Spain when it seeks to join the Euro, but you do not mention what Spain could do to solve these problems in an expedient way. This is because you have no sympathy for Spain's problems, but you do have sympathy and a degree of support for those of the Spanish Communist Party.

If you drive along I-96 in Novi , you ’ ve probably noticed a white water tower surround by empty land. The land is part of a parcel that was part of the U.S. War Department. The white water tower is an iconic image for Michigan’s largest city, with a population of close to 700,000. It has been the backdrop for countless photographs, whether by local photographers, or people passing through town to other points of interest like the Ford Rouge Plant, Grand Trunk Museum and the Metro Parks.

With Michael Gove ’ s ears still burning from being made to stand at the front of the class with an embarrassing pair of headphones, it is time to look ahead at this year’s GCSE exam schedule. The results are expected to show that, as predicted at the start of the year, the new tougher GCSEs have done little to dent the number of pupils sitting A-level examinations. There are some surprises, however, with a higher proportion of pupils sitting their AS-levels than last year. This is partly because the pass mark has been raised to 45 per cent.

It all comes to a head August 13 , when the final downloadable content for Dishonored hits the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

However, this final mission could be entirely new as well, bringing the total number of missions to a total of six.

Raising its black flag over the rugged mountainous regions of Afghanistan , the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) has become the largest jihadist organisation in history, eclipsing al-Qaeda as the dominant force in the fight against the West.

Raspberry frozen yogurt smoothies are light and refreshing . A raspberry frozen yogurt smoothie is a healthy drink to include in your diet, especially if you happen to be lactose intolerant like me. The yogurt helps thicken the smoothie for a more filling dessert. It also adds some protein from the yogurt. Add in some spinach, fresh or frozen fruit and you have a healthy low-calorie smoothie. This smoothie is not as thick as an ice cream, which can be good. If you want something thicker, try adding ice cubes to make a milkshake.

"I am probably not alone in noticing that the mainstream media 's deplorable unfair treatment of Israel is strikingly similar to the manner in which Jews were mistreated by the press in Germany during the late 19th century. And just as then, Jews in America and the world today are subject to an unrelenting campaign that demonizes them, and their government, as a ""pariah"" that cannot be trusted, despite Israel's status as a nation with a right to live in peace in its own region. It is also noteworthy that the treatment accorded the German Jews was not due to anti-German prejudice, or anti-Semitism."

As the Doug Ford government continues its assault on education , I ’ ve seen criticism of protesters from baby boomer professors of education. These professors are upset because they ’ ve taught for decades and know nothing of what it is to grow up in a society in which people can ’ t afford to go to college because they have to work two jobs to pay their rent. And yet, the professors complain that young people are “stupid” and should not be given “the vote” because they cannot be trusted with the government.

"Tsinghua University Professor Patrick Chovanec alludes in his latest blog post t o three paragraphs in the FT that are of particular interest to us:





It is well known that at any given moment, a small group of individuals is making the big decisions.

In this post, I will argue that there is also value in knowing how the individual decision-makers are affected by the choices they make."

One, who has talked to him recently , said Romney told them he doesn't think he could beat Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Apple 's cigar box desktop , better known as the Mac mini , has always been something of an oddball. In a way, Apple has never made any sense when it comes to desktops. While the original desktop, released in 2007 , was a big step forward from the original G4 , the current line-up of desktops is almost unrecognizable in terms of design from that original model. Over the years, we have seen the Mac mini make some strides forward, such as when Apple added gigabit ethernet to the line in 2011.
The Joint Committee on Education has one meeting left to discuss what should go into a funding formula for higher education as the legislative session comes to an end. The committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow morning at 9:00 in the Senate chambers.

The House of Delegates would have to pass a funding formula bill in order for the House to consider the Senate bill.
`` Few people are forced to deal with mainframes and COBOL and rarely anyone does so voluntarily ; those subjecting to them are either forced into it or their company wants them to use it. In my case, I wanted to learn it because I found it exciting and challenging. But the fact that I was paid for it made me do the best job I could, because I was interested. If I wasn't being paid for it then I'm not sure if I would have given the full effort. Now, if it's just a learning exercise then you might be in the same situation.

The film's premise is simple enough: a trader on a high-stress day loses his house and is forced to rob the bank where he works in order to pay down a loan he borrowed.

Trump/Republicans put more money in the pocket of all working people regardless of salary/wage range thru paying lower tax rates for low and middle income people. This allows for less money being spent on public programs which helps them, and makes the country as a whole a little more competitive with other countries that pay less. Trump/Republicans believe that by cutting taxes, we will not only have less money to spend on public programs, but that this will also create more economic growth and jobs for us all. This will in turn generate more money for the federal and state governments.
I am not a fan of Mamata Banerjee ’ s rhetorical politics nor do I believe that BJP cant gain power in Bengal through her. I also believe there is a conspiracy to defame her in the media. In this post, I am going to explain why I think it is so. First, let me say Mamata Banerjee is a great leader and she has done many good things for Bengal . In fact, she has made Bengal a model of governance and the fact that the common man in Bengal loves her speaks volumes of the fact that she has brought about some fundamental changes in the governance of the state.

Largest new U.S. refinery since 1976 planned for N.D. Plans are moving forward to build the biggest new refinery in North Dakota since the 1980s, but state leaders say it will create jobs and boost the local economy — at a cost of more than $2 billion. When it comes to refineries, the boom and bust of the U.S. energy industry can often be felt in North Dakota, where a huge influx of investment in the 1970s led to more than 40 large-scale oil refinery projects that fell apart before being completed or completed with minimal use. Now the industry is once again booming.

The Taranaki Iwi Claims Settlement Trust was set up in 2011 and is looking after a number of iwi claims to make money for future generations. There are four claims that the Trust is managing at the moment, including for the Tangaroa Whakamutu claim on the Whakatane foreshore that it has been negotiating for four years. A group of Ngāti Raukawa and Ngāi Tūhoe people are also part of that claim, along with the Ngāti Toa Rangatiratanga o Aotearoa and Te Tai Tokerau tribal trusts.

It was a really tough, long, hot stage race with a climb at the end. The team car in the race was a Fiat.

We ’ ve all heard the naysayers complaining about the lack of affordable housing options in Austin . However , it ’ s not because there are not a lot of options out there; we ’ re simply talking about too many high-demand units in too small a geographic area, leaving far too few options for folks who want the very best housing deal. In the case of downtown Austin, it has been estimated that the current rental market is more than 60% unaffordable to low-income residents, while high-income renters are barely squeezed into the market at 50% of the area’s average income level.

WATCH : A new survey shows what a lot of people already know : many British Columbians are living paycheque to paycheque. That’s despite record-high wages, an unemployment rate of five per cent and high home prices.

I live with three people in a $1,000-a-month townhouse in Vancouver. I can’t afford groceries, I can’t afford clothes, I can’t afford medicine.

Harriet , the eagle that has fascinated millions on Facebook, is not the kind of bird you'd expect to see flying in the rain, but she will do it in order to keep her secret life a secret.

In recent years , the weeks before the draft have seen the emergence of multiple names of players who tested positive for Adderall use and failed drug tests, as well as players whose failed tests are now being scrutinized after they declared themselves “drug free” and cleared their systems. The NFL and NFL Players Association agreed this week to implement a strict policy that will force players to submit their blood samples three times over three days in order to clear the system of a banned substance. Those who fail will serve a one-year suspension, and be subject to additional testing during the period of that suspension.
"One of the most impressive cosplays at this year ’ s Otakuthon in Montréal , Canada was Starcraft-related . But I wasn ‘ t there and didn ‘ t see the coser herself, so let ’ s have a little chat about Starcraft cosplay:

Cosplay as an Industry

For a long time now, there has been a divide between cosplay as an artistic form of expression, and cosplaying as an industry. Both forms of expression are important, and I believe that both should be embraced. I think that the industry side of cosplaying is one of the best parts, and I encourage cosplayers to pursue it as such."
The move makes the Beautiful Group the Edina company 's largest franchisee . Regis Corp. has sold nearly 1,100 of the restaurants to a company in New York with plans to rebrand them as Regis Steak 'N Shake . Regis was a franchisee of the Steak 'N Shake chain from 2000 to 2002.

That company, Edina-based Steak 'n Shake LLC, then bought the franchise back from Regis in June.

Even more on today ’ s Star Tribune Minnesota Poll : The Star Tribune ’ s Mondale/Coleman poll is obviously a disaster in terms of Democratic presidential primary votes, but the numbers are not as bad as you might think. To begin with, the poll is in the field a long time, so a lot of things will change between now and the caucus. Mondale/Coleman has polled for a long time now — the last one was in January, the first was in June. The January poll was before the New Hampshire caucuses, when voters were not looking to find their second choice for president.

COLUMBUS ( AP ) — State officials say Ohio recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program help do not have to pay the full amount of their benefits until they are billed by the federal government. That's the case with Ohio's version of food stamps, known as the Electronic Benefits Transfer System, or EBT. Recipients in Ohio are paid a weekly benefit in three lump sum payments. But the federal government bills Ohio for the full amount of the three payments in a lump sum, as it would for any other state.

The Toros appeared poised for a second consecutive win, down one goal, with the clock just seconds away from expiring in the fifth period.

Football coaches are apt to get a lineman angry before a game ; all he has to do is beat on the offensive line until that lineman thinks that it might be the last time he gets hit. A great quarterback can get an entire defense on their feet before a play even begins, as they try to guess what he will do and where he will throw it before the receiver even lets go of the football. If a football player has played in high school and college, he has already had that game on his resume and should expect to be paid.

Wall Street 's young , ambitious financial analysts routinely work into the night plotting strategies to help their companies make money . And they've got a pretty simple formula: Buy stocks when the price is cheap, sell them when it's time to make a profit and bet the company will be successful when it goes public. Some Wall Street veterans believe the new generation of analysts aren't as smart or diligent as the old guard, and they are concerned that when the next financial crisis strikes, some of these analysts may not have the smarts to navigate the situation.
They are business executives . Political movers and shakers . Sports icons . Media moguls . They 're the most powerful people in business. And as they spend time with President Barack Obama, these high-profile guests will bring to mind a few things.

And if they want to show how good he is, Obama will likely have a few drinks.

Wells Fargo returns to the top of the Viral Video Chart this week with its prosaic campaign about mobile banking security. On the surface, the ad is pretty unremarkable — you can tell that Wells Fargo is advertising a mobile app for banking purposes by the mobile banking app icon, and the ad features a few people in a bank telling people about mobile banking, and a few people in a bank using the mobile banking app — but the story it tells is powerful and memorable, and it's so good that I had to watch it three times in a row before realizing what was going on with the ending.

Those verses and so many more continue to inspire Christians today , so it ’ s real easy to assume that they must have been written by a certain “ author.” But they were probably written by a man named John and a woman named John , and it was a time before the gospels were written and a time before we knew the exact dates of Jesus ’ birth and death , so there is really no way of knowing the author of the verses that we call the Bible . But that is only one of many questions that people have asked and still ask.

It is a good sign if you see him leaving his house on foot. A taxi driver, however, will have to lead you to the mosque, where a small group of men will escort you there. You may be lucky and find the sheikh there.

At least four people were confirmed to have been killed, but this figure is likely to increase as rescue efforts continue and search parties go door-to-door.
`` But among Democratic activists , the debates over the Green New Deal tend to mirror long-running debates over the best way to deal with climate change ― or not. For some, it’s a solution they can get behind: A massive government mobilization to solve all of our problems. Others think it would be a waste of time, money and resources. The divide over the Green New Deal is no different from that among Democrats. The divide is between progressives who embrace a more aggressive approach to tackling climate change and those who look at the issue as a problem that can be solved without a massive government response.

UPDATE: It’s Been A While, But We’re Back And Better Than Ever

We were down for a while due to some hard times in our personal lives that took our focus off of everything we love to do. We had a few family emergencies that put a lot of stress on everyone involved. We were also having some technical issues that prevented us from sharing our stories with you all for quite some time."
Traditionalists might baulk at the idea of an electric classic Ferrari but for fans of cleaner cars who have very deep pockets and a desire for an ultra-rare Ferrari, this is exactly what you're looking for. At £1.6 million, it will set new records as the most-expensive electric Ferrari sold, but there's more than meets the eye. For all the talk of performance, this is a vehicle that takes its time. It may not be quick by the standards of the standard 458, but it's certainly fast by Ferrari's standards.
"Mobile development is as much about UI artistry and screen flow as technical programming . This premium on presentation means that when we create new designs we’re often forced to think in terms of both art and code, with an eye to getting the job done while keeping the user’s experience fast and fluid. When creating these experiences, you need to consider:

How do I make it easy to accomplish what they want? How is the user experience of interacting with my application? Does it work on mobile? How can I make it fit in the screen?"
Jeff Bridges squares off with his digital re-creation in this new poster for Joseph Kosinski 's high-tech sequel . We're not surprised to hear that he's also reprising the role of Rick Deckard for the sequel . But, hey, we're more than thrilled to learn that the film looks just as good (or maybe even better ) as ever, now that we can see a lot more of our man from the future . You know, the future in which Deckard's been on a murder-hunt all these years. Check out the poster below.
"Children on their way to school scream to seek the attention of van driver to stop the vehicle , seeing that they do not wish to get out of car. This is what they say: ‘The van driver is not listening to my cries for help. Why don’t you let us out. The van driver is not stopping for me. There are children on my way to school crying out to be let out. Let us get out of here. Please.’

This happens in my country and I do not know the exact incidence."

The first time I came to Canada was in March 2017, a year after I finished my studies. I was planning to go home after graduation in July 2017, but a new job opportunity presented itself. I applied, got the job and got the opportunity to travel. I decided I wanted to visit Canada as a tourist but ended up traveling alone. I didn’t go out of my way to visit Canada at all."
According to a Nature Nanotechnology paper , a group of scientists were able to create a wearable that fit onto the upper back of each ear and was then powered by a lithium-polymer battery pack, which gave them about two days' worth of power. The battery was able to be recharged in the same way as the smartphones of today; via an inductive charging coil placed just underneath the ear. According to The Telegraph , the team created a working model that was able to power an LED, which they were able to use to blink a message through.

In all the hubbub about the election and the issues that will decide it , one lingering challenge to America seems to have been ignored--the role of the Christian in our nation. This is not because Christians have been silent about their faith; they have spoken out, loudly and with passion. But their concerns have gone largely unnoticed. This is unfortunate because they are among the most important stakeholders in America. In this article we look at how they have responded in the last few years to challenges in our country, and what role they should play going forward.

A ban on trans fats in restaurants in New York state has been linked to hundreds of fewer heart attacks and strokes. A review of the evidence by The BMJ found the ban was the single most effective intervention to lower death rates. However, it has also raised health risks among people who eat less fat. One study has suggested that those eating less could suffer an increase in the risk of dying from cancers, heart disease and strokes. The new research found a 15% reduction in the number of coronary heart disease deaths.

It 's a rare thing that happen to games before they 're even out of Early Access , and it 's happened on both sides: some people want to like the game they 're getting, but their first impressions are either too harsh or too lenient. On one hand, there's no doubt PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds has some great moments. It's a fun, well-balanced game with lots of variety. On the flipside, it 's also got a few rough edges.

"WASHINGTON—U.S . President Donald Trump on Sunday defended his use of the phrase “ Mission Accomplished ” to describe a 2003 military campaign in Iraq, saying, “ I never said that. ”

His comments came amid criticism from Democratic lawmakers and others, including former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. “ I never said that. I never said that. I said it was time to go home, and everybody was surprised when I said it. That was a long time ago, before I was president. But I never said that. That was a mission we were very proud of, and it was done well."
Few people in the world are worse at handling social situations than Larry David . After all , the legendary comedian has been known to be a loner all his adult life.

In fact , he has been talking about this traumatic incident on a semi regular basis . So what is it about the subject that gets Larry to spill his guts? We can only wonder .
"Rural places without many restaurants may welcome your new fast-food restaurant . Fast-food restaurants provide quick meals to people on the go. When they are offered in rural places, a few things may be true about the meals:

They may be better than nothing

People in remote rural places may welcome your arrival because there are not many other options besides fast-food restaurants. They may not mind that you offer a different type of food than they are used to. In some cases, they may even welcome your fast-food meals as a blessing because there are not many other good options available in their area."

A sermon by Art MacDonald , Ph.D. Several weeks ago I participated in a three day anti-racism training workshop which was organized by the University of Michigan. In the workshop we were given several tasks to do in order to learn how to become effective anti-racism educators. One of these tasks was to do a “reality check.” This means we were asked to reflect upon our own lives and experiences, to ask ourselves some hard questions about our beliefs, to really examine our own prejudices and attitudes, and to see if there is any way we can become anti-racist.
Associated Press A few jewelry findings and two skeins of embroidery thread are all you need to create these colorful bead jewelry creations. Use your imagination and choose a color palette to suit the occasion. This is a great way to recycle those leftover pieces from last year. I love how you can change the look of the jewelry simply by the type of thread used or the color of the bead. The best thing is that you can choose the colors and materials you like most and make your own version of this classic look. For example, you can change the colors by using pearls or beads.

EASTER 2019 is quickly approaching as Christians across the world get ready to celebrate . But why do we celebrate? Well, the Bible is very clear, the celebration is a response to Christ's death on the cross, and the hope he offers to us in the gospel. The church has always had a very special place in this celebration, the church has always been seen as the community of faith that Jesus has called us to be, and this is a very special celebration. The church has always been a central part in these celebrations, it has always been central in our faith.
Arnold Schwarzenegger has moved the immigration debate by his acceptance of the principle of universal health care . I can't agree with that. Health care can and must be provided on a voluntary, not on a mandatory basis. The principle of universal health care means that a citizen of any state in the Union of United States can get health care irrespective of the place of his or her residence. Universal health care means that everyone in the entire country has equal access to medical care regardless of his or her wealth or income. Universal health care is a principle, not a law.

Google Transparency Report for July-December 2012 shows law enforcement surveillance requests on the rise . In the first part of this report, we have highlighted the fact that the number of government requests for user data from Internet companies have increased in the last four months compared to 2011 and also that Facebook has been a victim of several such requests. Facebook was granted access to the data in many cases. But, as we have seen in other countries, such access has been given to law enforcement agencies across the world to gather a wide spectrum of information such as IP address, telephone number, e-mails and Facebook profile details.

An exploit for this vulnerability has been created . The exploit sends commands from the shell to the modem via the standard serial interface (COM port) to which the modem is attached. In turn, these commands trigger the modem to send the attacker's own command to the device it has attached to .
WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has announced that the U.S. is pulling out of a treaty with Russia that bans the production and stockpiling of some chemicals deemed to be weaponized. The U.S. says the ban is outdated and inconsistent with U.S. laws, and has been preparing to withdraw for several months. The chemical weapons treaty was negotiated under President George W. Bush in 2001. The Trump administration’s announcement came shortly before the U.S. left the Iranian nuclear deal. The U.S. has been a party to the treaty since then.

The Fifth Columnist , a Legendary Journalist , is one of the very few books written about the media scene in the sixties. The author, Peter J. Knight , a Pulitzer-Prize nominee for his reports from Vietnam , has written an exposé of New York’s tabloid press during the turbulent 1960s. He paints a fascinating and shocking portrait of the time, and of the people and places he was close to. One of the things I like about the Fifth Columnist is its light, wry touch as it recounts the events of a time, the 1960s, that are still remembered.

Following an extended battle with the Motion Picture Association of America , the documentary film Bully has at long last won the organization's R rating. The victory is a bittersweet one for the filmmaker, since the MPAA had originally demanded a PG rating (which Bully doesn't carry) in order to allow the documentary to play on all of the movie theaters in the United States. Director Matthew Heineman's film has been hailed by critics and audiences alike, winning the grand jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival and the coveted Audience Award at Sundance.
Ontario tax money is subsidizing a Bell call centre in Peterborough , ostensibly as part of an economic-development strategy for the city. But the arrangement appears to be more than a coincidence, given that the company is located in the neighbouring municipality of Brantford and, in this case, receives a significant share of its operating subsidies from the province, despite being a separate entity. The centre, which has been in operation since the early 1980s, is one of many Bell call centres scattered throughout Ontario, all of which are funded with taxpayer dollars through a $2.3-billion Economic Development Ontario Corp. (EEDO) enterprise agreement with the province.
ROME ( Reuters ) - A busy road that cuts through Rome ’ s ancient forum to the Colosseum was re-opened and traffic was allowed on Tuesday after Italy ’ s government reopened the country to foreign travellers. Traffic was blocked last week by the closure of state-owned Autostrade, which ran the A1 highway through the city, as part of anti-terrorism measures. Rome police said they had arrested a group of people allegedly linked to Islamic State in a raid on an apartment near the site, in the northern neighborhood of Mignone. There were no reports on Tuesday of arrests.
More Stores Have Closed So Far In 2019 Than In All Of 2018 . So What ? Last week , we asked “what” is wrong with the store closings of 2019? I’m sure we can do better this week.

Here’s the full list with a few other things I’ve read on other websites. I’m not sure if this list is accurate.

Last night I went to the demonstration in Tel Aviv to protest of the killing of Jawaher Abu Rahmah in an Israeli raid in her West Bank village. She was a 13-year-old who was hit by rubber bullets and died later of her wounds. I am ashamed of Israel’s brutality and of the United States and the European Union that have supported its actions. As Jews, we stand with our Palestinian brothers and sisters to demand an end to the ongoing Israeli crimes and inhumane treatment of them. It is time to put an end to the occupation, to the settlements and to the apartheid policies Israel practices against Palestinians.
128MB ; USB 2.0 ; Secure Web surfing , smallest Flash drive available . Tiny size . Very good price . Excellent performance . Relatively fast when it comes to USB 3.0 . Easy to carry . Available in many colors . Can be bought in many countries . In my opinion a must-have . I've been using a 128GB flash drive for a while now and it's still a very good option on the market. The USB 2.0 is not the best option when you need to download big files very fast, but for smaller files and internet surfing it performs really fine.

Two more companies had signed Microsoft patent agreements covering their Android and Chrome devices , under the company 's IP Exploitation and Prevention program (I'm assuming this includes all Android, and Chrome devices from other vendors, too, such as HTC, and even Samsung, who has their own in-house design team). This is a very important move in the smartphone wars, with the number of mobile operating systems out there today ranging from 4 to 20. If you've ever wondered why Microsoft's Windows phone platform is not as popular, it's now becoming clear why.
Teams work better with clear , shared , attainable goals . The acronym SMART stands for specific , measurable , achievable , relevant , and time-bound . This simple acronym can help you define your goals and the steps necessary for reaching those goals. Start by thinking about who you need to work with to reach this goal. Do you need the help of a large company or the aid of a small company? Do you need a lot of money to achieve this goal, or only a little bit? How much time and effort will it take?
It totally lives up to the hype . I 'm not a huge breakfast person , but I do like this. The texture of the cookie dough is very very light , like the texture of meringues , but a little less dense , but the dough itself isn't too soft and it 's not too crispy like waffles either . I think it would also make an amazing cookie . The flavor is a mixture of lemon , lemonade , and vanilla , so it has a nice kick of sweet and tart , which I 'm not usually crazy about , but is balanced well by the cookie flavor .

There are many reasons why some drivers are better than others. A number of them apply to women drivers, too. One is that a female driver can’t make a mistake as much as a male driver can. If we think of a mistake as a failure to recognize a hazard, a woman driver can’t be in the same danger as a man can."

Earlier this week , the Supreme Court had issued an order allowing the government to impose the duty , setting the threshold amount at ₹1,300 per litre of petrol. The order is a major victory for the government , which has been pushing for an increase in tax on petrol for many months. A similar ruling will likely come in the coming days on the levy on diesel, which is expected to increase from ₹1.50 per litre to ₹3, but which may not be imposed on all countries. Expectations are high in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the government.
"the cpu socket . Any help would be great . just got a dragon + board myself a couple weeks ago

Just to clarify, are you trying to get a full speed core i3 or i5? The only difference between those is the TDP. If its a Core i5 then the i5-2500k has a TDP of 35 watts. Yes. My friend just got a Ryzen 3 1300X and his new machine has the same motherboard i have. Its a gigabyte board. Is the i3 2600k and i5-2500k different in CPU socket? My friend bought it for $200 from the local computer store."

Three of the four acting contests are sewn up , and the fourth ( Best Actor ) is reaching mathematical closure. That leaves one more category to be contested. It is the Supporting Actor category and we have a couple of contenders. One in the form of Tom Hiddleston and another in the form of Jim Broadbent . I can’t see a win for one over the other, but both are worthy nominees. I would be happy with either of those guys getting a nomination. I would be ecstatic if they were both nominated. But alas, one of them is not going to be.
A focus on dense , walkable development allows cities to pack more economic punch per square foot , according to a new study by the University of North Carolina. While dense, walkable urban areas are often associated with urban areas in Asia, Europe, and the Pacific Rim, they are spreading across the U.S., including large areas of the Southeast, Southwest, and West Coast. “There’s just a lot to learn about dense, compact, walkable neighborhoods,” according to Greg Lindsay, a fellow at the Urban Land Institute, a nonprofit association that publishes research about land use.

Samsung at CES 2019 is showcasing its latest television technology , a tradition for the company from past CES trade shows. This year the company's TV technology will be introduced to a new audience thanks to its partnership with LG, which will co-produce the 2018 LG OLED TV lineup at CES 2019. The partnership is a big step forward for Samsung as it enters the OLED TV business.

There are a number of elements in the recent release of an indictment of twelve named alleged Russian military intelligence officers, who are charged with the crime of conspiring to act as agents of the Russian Federation. They are charged with this offence in the context of their alleged involvement in cyber attacks and interference in US elections. This is the latest in a growing series of such indictments. There have been three so far, the last being against a number of Russian intelligence officers who are charged with interfering in the 2016 US presidential election on behalf of the Russian state.
HARTFORD -- Six years ago Sunday , Connecticut 's problem with a billion-dollar budget deficit was finally solved when then-Gov. Jodi Rell and Democratic legislators reached a deal on a so-called 'grand bargain.' But, according to a report issued last week, that deal, reached in July of 2002, isn't holding up very well. A new report released by the Rell administration on June 24 found the state's debt to be $10.5 billion higher than the previous estimate, released in August 2001. The deficit, according to the report, is now about $4 billion.
"Many landlords are not even aware of the ramifications of this proposal . If I owned rental property ( which I do) I would be out of business. My rates would go up by 30% and I could not make up that increase in rental value. If I have to charge double for my services, I can't even afford to make payments on my loans and taxes . I need to see how this would impact my bottom line and my ability to make my mortgage and taxes on time. 2

Prime Minister David Cameron threw his weight behind calls for the use of video technology in football , after Frank Lampard and Michael Owen made a series of controversial claims that referees were failing to award them penalty kicks for fouls. Lampard, who was speaking before a charity match between Chelsea and Portsmouth at Stamford Bridge on Thursday, said England’s Premier League side have been denied a succession of penalty kicks following “anomalies” in the system. He claimed that “one or two” decisions had gone against Chelsea when the game had been in the balance but had not resulted in the team being awarded a goal.
TUSCALOOSA , Ala. - A wave of tornado-spawning storms strafed the South on Wednesday , splintering buildings across hard-hit Alabama and killing six people as emergency crews were racing to find survivors and recover victims' bodies. More than 90,000 homes, businesses and vehicles were without power and more than 200,000 people across the southern half of the state were told to prepare for a possible tornado emergency, said Alabama Emergency Management Agency director Allen Sills. After the latest round of storms passed, officials said they had not found anyone still trapped in damaged mobile homes.

The signing was held on October 9th at the Palace of the Grand Master at the Government House. Malta is one of Europe’s smallest nations, but the US delegation that is arriving is not small in number. The United States is expected to sign an estimated $2bn worth of arms agreements during the visit of the delegation to Malta.
Former Secretary Enrique Ona said his successor at the Department of Health is “ solely responsible ” for the dengue outbreak in Metro Manila that has killed hundreds, because the DOH failed to contain the disease in two years of his watch. The Department of Finance has no plans to audit the Duterte administration’s tax amnesty program that has failed to collect billions of pesos in delinquent taxes as it claimed, the tax agency said Thursday. “We are not aware of any audit on the TIN (tax amnesty program) being planned,” tax agency spokeswoman Elvie A. Abay said.
WHILE the release of American hostage Edward Tracy on Sunday brought relief to Americans , the kidnapping and subsequent release of another American captive, Gary Faulkner, is a reminder of Afghanistan's inability to protect citizens who are not U.S. soldiers. Although Mr. Faulkner and Mr. Tracy, an employee of a private security firm, were captured by insurgents on Aug. 1, Mr. Faulkner's family was notified of his status in captivity on Aug. 6, a day before he was freed. In the nearly two months he was held, both men were blindfolded when moving about in their captors' vehicles.

» Play World Soccer Challenge IRENE , South Africa – Bob Bradley sounds more like a student discussing a teacher in his final exam than someone in charge of a team preparing for the Confederations Cup in a month’s time. The USA manager is still coming to terms with losing the 2010 World Cup, the last time his team won at the World Cup finals. ”It is a difficult time for all of us. It was not only a difficult time for all of us,” said Bradley after his team defeated the Czech Republic 2-0 on Tuesday.
LAKELAND , Fla. - Drew Jackson ’ s ability to handle the outfield corners , with today marking his first official game action since being acquired in a trade with the Cleveland Indians , has certainly been a highlight of the early portion of the 2019 season. With the Red Sox’s first game of the season coming off of a day off, it was not an ideal opportunity to debut Jackson at Fenway Park - but Jackson did what he has been doing all spring long - he delivered. While it has only been three innings, Jackson has done well for himself - putting up two ground-ball outs to right field.

SAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco needs to lower the cost of housing . That ’ s the CEO of Yelp, Eric Schmidt’ s response when asked why the company recently announced it was expanding into San Francisco, which is experiencing an affordability crisis.

"Liquor legend Sidney Frank created Grey Goose in 1997 , betting that Americans would pay for quality , whether perceived as vintage or not. He was wrong . Grey Goose has been accused of faking vintage labels for years. But in 2014 , the company decided to make good on its promise of ""the best bottle"" . Grey Goose , which is made at the St. Germaine distillery near Reims, in the French region of Lorraine, is now selling two bottlings: the classic Vermouth de Grey Goose and Vermouth Rouge . And they're both good."
Koepele suggests that replacing our current water-delivery canals with pressurized pipe would miraculously save 300,000-acre-feet of water . The project is estimated to cost about 1,800 acres. But the estimated cost per acre of pipe is only $4.50. I don’t think there is anyone who will seriously argue that the proposed new canal system is not expensive. Yet we have not had any serious discussion of cost/benefit, which is important in deciding whether the government should be doing something like this. I do not think it will cost $6,000,000,000, but I have no idea what the cost of the project will actually be.
THE jury was discharged by the judge on Thursday in the trial of a former Lord Mayor of Bradford charged with the indecent assault of a child under 16 years of age. The trial had been suspended for 10 days after the jury failed to reach verdicts. The jury of nine women and three men had retired on Wednesday to consider its verdicts. Lord Mayor Andrew Bowtell was accused by a complainant of sexually assaulting her in a public lavatory while she was drunk on the night of 26 May last year. Bowtell had denied the charge.

The patient had gone back to her hometown to undergo treatment. ""We've never seen a case like this in the past. Usually this sort of thing happens only after a lot of time and in a very advanced stage."

In May , the Administration unveiled a legislative proposal for cybersecurity that is now working its way through Congress . The proposal includes a set of incentives that would encourage more information sharing between private entities and the U.S. government, as well as additional funding to help private-sector companies and the federal government better defend networks and information against hackers. But the Administration has also proposed a set of new laws that would give the federal government unprecedented access to Americans' communications and data in the name of cybersecurity—and many in the technology community are opposed to those laws, fearing that they would harm innovation, free speech, and other basic American values.

"STOCKTON - To say the Edison High boys basketball team has a new coach would technically be true . But in terms of actual numbers and personnel, it's not exactly new. In fact, it was a lot like last year - or the year before that - when the Panthers went 7-13, which was the last time they played a season in the postseason. ""There was a little bit of a carryover from last year,'' said first-year Coach Steve Smith. ""The new players were familiar with the new coaches, so we didn't have to really go through the learning curve again."
At the 19th extraordinary session of the UN General Assembly , which focused primarily upon the implementation of the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) , there was a renewed focus on the need for the UN Secretary General to provide a “Global Goals Strategy” that outlines and provides the political and financial commitments of the 193 member-states. At the time, I had raised this issue, which was discussed during the UNGA in September 2016, on my blog in the hope that it would gain some more attention at the UNGA this year.

BEIRUT — Islamic State militants attempted to break out of a detention facility in northeastern Syria but U.S.-backed Syrian fighters stopped them with a tank, a spokesman said Sunday. The Islamic State escape came nearly two months after the militants’ defeat at the al-Baghouz enclave in eastern Syria. U.S. commanders said last month that most militants had been corralled in small pockets of the desert, where they are expected to be kept under strict surveillance while the United States seeks a negotiated settlement between the group and Syrian Kurdish forces who fought alongside the U.S. in Syria.
People struggling to cope with their animals have been urged to seek help after two pugs were tossed from a car in a horror smash. Both dogs, believed to be from the same litter, were thrown out from a car on the M25 in Hertfordshire after being driven away from an animal rescue charity. The driver had driven off after being told there was no money to be paid for the pugs they were looking after - and when the charity found them, the driver had left without returning to collect the dogs. Police say the driver crashed the car shortly afterwards, leaving the two animals trapped in the back.

"A new game in the pipeline requires the player to swallow a sensor . Forbes.com says Guts Game requires two sensors to play. I'm not sure how they get the sensors inside, but in my games it would be similar to this:

Is there any good tutorials on how to make games with more than one sensor, preferably using Processing? I'm thinking on buying a Raspberry PI for this, but I wanted to ask people with experience first before buying it."
Los Angeles Rams & apos ; Brandin Cooks understands that being in the NFL and playing in the Super Bowl is a privilege, not a requirement to be successful. Cooks was born in Los Angeles to an immigrant father and a mom who worked hard to provide for him and his three siblings. Cooks went from high school football to the University of Oregon to the NFL. He is the ultimate student of the game and knows the value of not only being smart, but being smart about what he does in his game.
The Oracle of Omaha owes much of his success to the Oracle from India . There is n't a single day on which Warren Buffett has not met a member of India's IT industry, or spoken with them on the phone. In the course of their conversations, they have shared the pain of their lives and the challenges they face in doing business with India . Buffett tells them that he is sympathetic to their problems and wishes them all the best in their lives. In the process he has managed to gain an edge over them. They are his people and they trust him implicitly.
The government has rejected Somerset County Council 's plans for a single unitary authority in the area . An announcement was made yesterday that the government will be holding a series of public consultation events for people in the area which will be held over the coming months before making a decision on whether to make the area a unitary authority from April 2013. This means that local councillors will need to re-cast their wards, and make sure the boundaries of these wards correspond with new constituencies. The government has also suggested that the proposed Somerset/Gloucestershire boundary be altered to meet the criteria for the new boundaries.
It is always interesting to watch true lobster aficionados in a restaurant . To them , everything else on the menu just can’t hold a candle. When I was younger, I was one of these people. It is the way I was raised. My father grew up that way in New Jersey. He was a lobsterman when he was growing up and that is how we ate lobster in my house for dinner on a daily basis. It was something that my mother and I would eat on the weekends. I liked it and I still do today, but that was the extent of how I ate lobster.

Department of Infrastructure , Regional Development and Cities , however , believes the important factor will be how the different parties react to this. “I think what is most interesting to see is whether there is a more unified response from all the parties, and whether you can see some political will on the ground to be able to do something on infrastructure, which is so important to all the people of Australia . “I think the first thing for everybody to do is to recognise that this is a very, very critical moment. “And to work out how best to move forward and work together .
After a delicious romantic saga Thattathin Marayathu , Vineeth Sreenivasan attempts to make a thriller this time , with Thiraikku Thiraikku .

There is a flashback to a year before in the present .
In June , a group of nuclear tech companies , including Silicon Valley startup Kurion , started cleaning the tens of millions of tons of nuclear debris that remain in the U.S. West. At first, the companies didn’t know if they could even safely dispose of the contaminated material. But in January, an agreement signed between the U.S. State Department and U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry allowed for this. And Kurion was among the first companies to win the right to move ahead. “It’s taken a long time and a lot of work and a lot of patience.

You can expect Netflix to work very closely with the government of Pakistan , just like other TV channels . It’s not a secret that the country’s authorities are keen to censor and monitor content that they don’t approve of, so it’s expected that Netflix will continue working closely with the Pakistani government. There’s also a chance that Netflix’s move to the Pakistani market will give more credibility to local content providers , who’ve complained for some time about how easy it’s been to pirate movies and TV content.

A few months ago , Lloyd wrote about how many tiny homes are too cutesy and even `` ugly , '' but that they are gaining popularity due to their affordability. Now, we look at two tiny home builders that have taken that approach and turned the whole thing around. These tiny home builders have taken the idea to the extreme by adding a whole new dimension with their design. Instead of being a cute little box, these houses are sleek and sexy. The homes themselves look as though they are floating, while they can be built anywhere in the world - even in places with the worst weather!

This time last year he was overshadowed by larger acts as he played to a small crowd at midday during the main stage on Day 3 of Glastonbury Festival. This time he sold more tickets than any artist this year at the Pyramid Stage. His performance was met with chants of “Where’s Prince?” The question was asked more than once. Prince was on the main stage of Glastonbury in 1995 and 1996 when he performed at the age of 21, but this time the legendary performer was on the smaller acoustic stage, having performed only once before in the UK in 2008.
"While plenty of attention has been paid to the fact that the U.S. dollar is trading near its highest levels in recent memory against a basket of other world currencies—and against its own 200-year-long gold standard history—it has attracted little attention as to whether or not the dollar is actually trading at its fair market value. As I have pointed out in previous blogs, if you want to get at what the dollar is actually worth you have to start with something called a ""par"" exchange rate which is basically the rate that would be paid if you were able to exchange $1 in U.S. dollars for $1 in another currency."
MANCHESTER CITY are set to beat Chelsea to the signing of Real Madrid right-back Danilo .

MANILA , SEPTEMBER 12 , 2008 ( STAR ) Filipino jobseekers can look forward to brighter overseas employment prospects in 2009, according to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration or POSEIDA. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued an executive order last Friday directing POSEIDA to draw up rules for a new visa category for young job seekers, particularly those in the 18 to 25 age-group.

But the cupboards are far from bare . Blue Springs South has a unique weapon with speedster Jerome Hawkins , a 6’6″ point guard who might be the fastest in basketball. Hawkins is quick enough to get by the defense on his own, but he can create space for others. When he is running around the floor as he did earlier this season, it forces defenders to be more cautious. When they do get past him, it puts pressure on the rim and creates turnovers. If he stays on the floor for a full game, it’ll make a huge difference for the Lions.

OTTAWA–Canada ’ s border guards are struggling under a backlog of federal access to information requests — some dating to the Trudeau era — but they are being buoyed by strong public support and growing business opportunities on both sides of the southern border. Despite a recent uptick, border officers say the number of requests is still far below that of a few years ago when the Conservatives were in office. That has created a backlog, but there’s a growing realization among officers in Canada’s busiest sector that they have a unique role in helping to shape the country’s new relationship with the European Union.
David Gee asks if the ‘ big two ’ ERP giants have seen their day and are making way for something new. When Microsoft announced its Dynamics CRM solution, many questioned if it had any chance in the current market dominated by the ‘ big two ’ – SAP and Oracle. As it turns out however, the answer is ‘no’ – it has a great chance. So what is Microsoft doing differently? What does it bring to the market that the other big two cannot provide? I had the pleasure to spend some time with the Dynamics CRM team and speak to several users.

Recent voting law rulings are complex , but this Q & A sorts them out . Madison — A dizzying number of new and old laws governing voting procedures, enacted in recent years and last week by Congress and the governor, could be put in place Tuesday, Nov. 7 , when voters go to the polls to cast ballots for the 2012 general election. Among them: new voting rights for felons; more time to register and change your address; a ban on some early voting; and a limit on early-voting sites. This is only an overview.

It may be a case of grab that new customer while you can . Wall Street analysts wondered why some of the company's products haven't become standard issue for major banks. It's a problem that affects other companies as well. In the world of software, one company's best-selling software is probably another company's worst nightmare. There's a catch to it all. As the industry moves toward more open software, the most popular software also seems to be the best-protected. That's a problem. The most obvious example of these two trends is the software package used by banks.

The fence along Louisiana Street is a compromise that will keep the crosswalk where it is.

Residents in one of the nation ’ s first planned communities — designed as a place where people could live, work and be together in harmony with nature and each other — are facing eviction and losing a home because the developer of the neighborhood is moving on. For almost 70 years, the residents of River Forest, Illinois, have been able to call their neighborhood home. It’s not your typical suburban subdivision — the houses, built in the 1950s, are built around a creek and a lake, and they were designed to bring neighbors and nature together.

Experts fear the cladding material , commonly used in high-rises , could pose a threat to buildings in cities like New York. In New York, there are more than 2,600 commercial and public buildings that use similar cladding, or façade products. A building with cladding can look just like one made with steel or concrete, but in reality it is made of material that is lighter, less costly to produce, and less vulnerable to fire. There is a growing debate on whether the city should regulate cladding, as a fire safety measure for commercial buildings.

Cable companies have historically played the tortoise to high-tech hares . They let someone introduce a new service , watch how people react , and wait a year or two for that product to mature before offering the service. That's not always the right decision, but there's usually some logic in it. And the cable business has done it well: It's been able to keep up with technology by waiting until companies have proven they have a viable product. Today cable companies have an important new competitor -- the internet . Unlike cable, the internet has been around a long time.

Mike Morrison — gay rights activist , vivid social media presence , brilliant and witty speaker — has a word of advice for younger LGBTQ activists. You might not think that a 40-year-old with two kids has much to offer someone who’s in their late 20s or 30s. But if you are new to LGBTQ activism, you need to understand that this is the generation of people who grew up in a country that was less accepting of us, and who didn’t necessarily have access to all the same resources that older LGBTQ activists were privileged with, like marriage equality and a supportive community.
If you ’ d told me a year ago that a movie featuring Superman and Batman would be one of the biggest hits of the summer I wouldn ’ t have believed it. But with a cast including Kevin Costner as Bruce Wayne/Batman and a script written by Christopher Nolan, I would ’ t have believed that a movie featuring Batman and Superman would be a box office smash at this stage in the DVD market. Batman Begins was the first movie I ’ ve ever watched three times and, in fact, I ’ ve watched it three times since then.

We sold all the big items that weren’t being used. He cut our clothing budget by 50 percent, and we sold everything else. When we had a baby, my husband went to work and paid the bills. I went to day care, took my son to activities, volunteered at church and school, and kept up with household tasks. As soon as we could afford to, we bought a smaller home.

WARSAW — Being a Catholic country has made the Philippines an attractive source of workers for Poland , whose right-wing government is keen to reduce the number of foreigners on its territory to make its labour market more “competitive.” In the last decade, the Catholic Church has helped bring more than 300,000 Filipinos to Poland to work in factories, in agriculture and as construction workers, mostly under contract through recruitment firms. Polish companies are also happy with these workers’ cheap wages and the fact that they often speak Polish and understand Polish culture. But Filipinos are not the only group to have moved to Poland.

With vinyl sales on the rise , and even helping push the sale of physical albums over those of digital files , one might argue that in the long term the vinyl format doesn't make financial sense . While that might seem like the case now, with the price of an LP on the decline , vinyl sales might make more sense in future. The price of LPs seems to be the biggest issue when it comes to whether or not a person buys them or not . Vinyl prices have been plummeting for decades , with records being sold at rock-bottom prices , and sometimes as cheap as the cost of a postage stamp.

You can imagine the science-fiction episode : A video game suddenly appears in an unwitting society . The game proves to be extraordinarily addictive. It turns out that all the game players, regardless of their origin or their education, are equally prone to it.

In the end it would be possible to predict that the game could be addictive and to prevent its development.

The USSR did it . Why not Russia ? During the Cold War , the Soviet Union organized its vast army and built the most advanced weapons system. Its military-industrial complex rivaled that of the USA. Russia has a large population, a well-educated populace, and the will to continue building and improving on the world’s most modern military weapons. However, it is not nearly as good at designing things as is the USA, or at least it’s military does not match up to the US’s military.

Now, that’s all well and good, and we applaud the efforts of these developers , but there are still some huge hurdles to jump. Unity is good, but it’s not very powerful, and it’s still far behind other platforms. For some developers, that might not be enough.

If that's true , America 's railroads shouldn't be too happy with themselves, or with you.

The misperceptions and misdeeds of the United States in the Middle East from the time of Dwight Eisenhower to the present continue at an unending pace. The United States, and its President, Obama, is a disgrace to the rule of law, human decency, self-respect and the concept of democracy. What does this mean? Let's examine some of the missteps. First we look at Egypt. The first misstep in Egypt occurred in 1952 when President Harry S. Truman sent General Eisenhower to depose Gamal Abdel Nasser, the democratically elected Prime Minister of Egypt.
"For Wesley Jordan , the past six days at work have n't been much different from any other week -- except that he's been getting paid instead of grading papers or attending class.

Experts cleaning a supposed imitation of a Botticelli painting have discovered it was actually created in the Renaissance master 's workshop and has been hanging at a London gallery for more than 40 years, it's claimed today. But the real Botticelli's master, Sandro Botticelli, is believed to have painted only four of the works, while his assistant, Francesco Traini, is thought to have executed two of the drawings.

He will be joined in his mission by Trump's daughter Ivanka and the president-elect himself. Trump and Kushner have long talked about the possibility of a peace summit with both China and Mexico. The meeting is part of an aggressive effort by the Trump administration to reshape foreign policy in ways that will benefit the US, particularly on issues like trade and military spending.

Is Clean Energy 's Niche Under Attack ? Clean Energy is focused on building natural gas demand in the industrial sector. In its current form, this is a niche market—it's only a fraction of the overall natural gas market, and it's a market that's been shrinking since 2006, not growing. But that doesn't mean that Clean Energy is under attack. In fact, clean energy could be the big winner from the shale revolution. In the last several years, many investors and analysts have characterized the natural gas industry as being oversupplied.
On May 20 , Mukesh Vaniya ( 40 ) , his wife Champa alias Jaya and their relative Savita were found dead in their apartment in Mumbai . Their bodies were charred in an attempt to burn them. The police had registered an offence under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 302 ( murder ) 302 ( murder by person other than head ) 302 ( b ) (g) (murder of husband and relative of husband or relative of wife) . The case had taken more than two months to probe and file charge sheet.
When Jared and Ivanka first arrived in Washington , the focus on their religious lives was more or less immediate. But the couple’s involvement in the Trump administration was more gradual. It was like their own reality show, with cameras following them to every event and every meeting. They were a big part of the campaign. Now, as they’ve made their mark, the scrutiny has turned to religion. What does their faith teach about how they’re leading the White House? And how does their faith compare to that of other evangelical Christians who serve in other prominent roles in the White House?

Somehow it ’ s hard to believe that Peter O ’ Toole is still in his 70s . Lawrence of Arabia, A Confederacy of Dunces and The Pornographer , his best novels, won’t be seen for another twenty years, and even then will probably only be appreciated by diehards. It is a sad reflection of our literary culture that an author who wrote one of the greatest pieces of satire ever written is now regarded as an obscure footnote to our literary past, and that the most powerful novel in the language is now seen as a comedy by most of the literate public.

"The hallways of the office in Manila that deals with overseas workers are generally packed . About five dozen men, most of them Chinese or Filipino, stand in line outside a window, waiting their turn for an interview. They all say the same thing: “I want to work in Saudi Arabia. But there are no jobs.”

One day a month or so ago, however, this small, windowless room was almost empty. Only a handful of Filipinos were lined up for their interview, and no one had much hope. The Philippines has a problem."
"But they are ready to monitor the steps of the new government closely and return to streets when necessary . ""It was our decision, but we did not force anyone,"" said the former leader.

""I would like to assure people that we are still ready to protect people and our country, and if it needs to be said, then we'll return,"" he said.

Two-generation programs focus on improving education for children and job opportunities for parents at the same time . ATLANTA—This neighborhood has been in the news lately, but for all the wrong reasons: shootings, robberies and other crimes are out of control. On the other hand, it also has an unusually high number of parents who are college-educated and working, which suggests that one reason for the crime problem is that too many kids don't have two parents working full time to raise them. There is no one solution. The real solution is for the whole community to work together to change this situation.

The AFACT has now appealed the decision.

We already know that 84 % of new buses will be electric by 2030 , which should bode well for us. But if we’d really like to live on Mars, then we also have to start planning for that. The most obvious option for an electric Mars Rover is a fully electric vehicle, with a battery providing all the energy it needs. But that only works if we can build a battery as big as all that space. That’s not really practical, since we’re not going to have enough lithium or vanadium, but we can go for an electric vehicle powered by hydrogen.

The Personhood National Campaign, the group pushing this agenda, has raised $10 million, according to its own figures, and they have a good reason to be optimistic.

He was referring to some teachers who went on strike for nine months to demand a pay hike and a better pension for teachers. The Mayor told the retired teachers who attended the ceremony that even though the teachers have been working for the government for over 30 years now, their salary has not increased at all for the last two years.

WHAT IT MEANS : Job gains in November were well below expectations – Yippee ! The idea we could sustain these job gains is ridiculous – and we will have to see if this is all it takes to keep unemployment below 7% – we are way above that. IT HAPPENED : Total Non-farm Payrolls were only up 115,000 in November. These numbers are very misleading as we are only seeing job growth in low wage service jobs with no significant growth in high wage industries like manufacturing or construction which is why we are so far above the 6.5% rate that economists had forecasted.

"Are you ready to flip the entrepreneurial switch ? If you work for someone else now and are thinking about leaving that job, think about how you can start your own company.

Some U.S. small-business manufacturing firms may be boosting their businesses by partnering with Chinese companies , Fox Business reported .

Mainers kill 0.5 bucks per square inch , the lowest rate in New England . With another deer season winding down for Maine, it might be a good idea to take another look at our gun season. While there is no legal deer season this year, I think the state should take another look at gun deer seasons in the interest of fairness. The most common reason given for a short gun deer season is a desire to protect the right to hunt from an overburdened court system. I’d argue that the court system is not to blame for a dearth of court-issued licenses to hunt.

A typical teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District makes roughly $ 80,000 a year , but those wages don't include the thousands of dollars it takes a teacher to pay for classroom supplies like books, paper and chalk, according to the most recent data from the National Education Association (NEA). The union says teacher spending accounts for 10 percent of a district's annual budget and has been increasing at a rate faster than the rate of spending cuts across other education departments at the federal, state, and school district levels.

Some 20 percent of dogs and an unknown percentage of cats develop osteoarthritis . We think of it as a human condition because it mostly affects joints of the body, but it’s actually more common in dogs than we think. In fact, it affects nearly 1 in 5 pets, and most of these dogs live a long life with arthritis that eventually results in an early death. Although the arthritis is painful for the animal, the disease can be managed with diet and lifestyle changes, and many cases can be managed successfully without surgery or even painkillers.

State Bank of India ( SBI ) has witnessed a 46 % surge in the mobile-banking space in the 2014 Q4 compared with the corresponding quarter in the previous fiscal. In the current fiscal ( FY2015-16 ), the bank expects this to grow to around 100 %. To drive this, the bank is now looking to extend its services, which have been limited to customers in the urban area, to people in villages and towns and even in the suburbs. This move will not be limited to only the current quarter but will be a sustained effort over the coming two or three quarters.
For years , some federal lawmakers have looked incredulously at the ever-growing — and in some cases multibillion-dollar — endowments of private colleges and universities. Now, they are beginning to put their own names on the tuition bills of private schools in a way they could have never imagined as freshmen members of the U.S. House and Senate. The latest: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, co-sponsors a bill this week that would give a tax break to private colleges that pledge to help students pay back their college loans. The proposal, the Education Department says, would be a way to encourage schools to help students pay down loans.

The Indian Express had reported last month that these people were convicted of crimes or violation of Passport ( Entry Clearance ) and Visa and they have entered India without any proper documents. India’s passport and visa norms are stringent and no Indian can enter India without his passport.

Hence these cases of passport fraud should also get the attention of Indian Government.

In a letter dated Sept. 5 and made public Thursday, Council President Thomas J. Smith and County Chief Administrative Officer James M.

They said the change will save money by eliminating the need for overtime and travel expenses to get employees’ feedback on the merit increases.

"FORT WAINWRIGHT , Alaska - All United States Army Soldiers raise their right hands and pledge selfless-service . Some Soldiers may swear an oath to God, while others swear to the flag. But none of us can pledge to uphold the constitution because we have been sworn into the U.S. Armed Forces. It is illegal for us to swear any oaths to anything other than a superior officer. However, over the past 100 years the United States has seen a massive shift away from the military as a force for ""the common defense"" in favor of the use of military power and coercion for the personal benefit of a select few."

Horsham manager Dominic Di Paola has ‘ got some thinking to do ’ this week as to whether he brings in extra staff to replace those who went into hospital this week. Horsham have been working in their offices for several weeks now to get themselves in a position where they can go into the Championship after being demoted into the Evostik League last season.

Antimalarial drugs have evolved to target many stages of the parasite's complex life cycle. Unfortunately, as drug-resistance emerges, drug development has slowed down. The emergence of drug resistance has become a global problem, threatening the achievement of World Health Organization malaria control goals. It is crucial that we develop new tools to overcome this problem.

Forty-three per cent of Canadians do n't know how long to wait to drive after consuming pot . OTTAWA — The federal Liberals want to legalize, regulate and restrict cannabis consumption. But Canadians aren't very familiar with the legal rules surrounding marijuana in their jurisdictions, which could play a huge role in how the Liberal plan is received. The Liberals have proposed creating a regulatory system in which pot would be made available to Canadians over-the-counter, with restrictions on sales, advertising and packaging. They'd create a system of government-owned stores, which the party says would be run by a branch of the alcohol and tobacco control board.

"Jaquan Adams ( 30 ) , shown during his senior season at Civic Memorial , is one of the newcomers in the New York Jets’ secondary. It was the summer before my freshman year of high school, when the New York Jets called me and my father to tell him they’d drafted me with the 45th pick of the 2008 draft. It was my first reaction. “They drafted my 15-year-old son? !”

Well , certainly that may be how this fictional story characterises it , however that 's a rather disingenuous jab , as such , for it is not the case that the US 's financial services sector is in a state of crisis . To begin , the US 's banking system is far from being a disaster . It is , on the contrary , doing remarkably well . The banking sector is far more sound that it is perceived to be by many . Its problems , if any , rest on Wall St , not Main St . This is why the Fed is so important in the US economy .

The first theory was that venture capital as it was structured was broken, not the VC model itself . I have argued this theory was partially correct . There are many reasons VC’s are broken . The first reason is there is always a shortage of demand for new investments . There are always more investors than companies looking for capital .

American Trucking Associations has strongly praised the introduction in the 116th Congress of a bill designed to facilitate interstate driving by making cross-state trucking easier for truckers to do. “A bill that would facilitate interstate driving by truckers is an important step toward greater safety and reliability in the interstate trucking industry. This is important for the U.S. economy and the American public, as well, because safer, reliable interstate trucking means less wear and tear on trucks and infrastructure,” said ATA Executive Vice President Todd Spencer. “This bill also makes sense because we are facing a shortage of drivers.

Rosie Martin , an intense teacher with glasses perched on the end of her nose and an oversized passion that radiates with each syllable she speaks, has spent the better part of the last 30 years working with children to help them overcome some of their biggest obstacles. And she’s got plenty of stories. But, as she likes to point out, this is not just the story of the children with whom she has worked. In fact, it’s a story about herself, and how she came to be that way. She grew up in what she describes as a very dysfunctional family.

I ’ ve struggled a bit with the proper role of a sitting councilperson when there are competing candidates for the office. I find myself leaning more towards the candidate who can articulate what he wants to see happen in council and who will do the least harm to current policy. There is very little that would prevent me from voting for someone else, but if you’re not willing to do the work that comes with being a candidate, it doesn’t leave much room for other options, even if that candidate has a better plan for moving our city forward.

Is eye cream worth it ? From cheap to eye-wateringly expensive , Facegoop tests four eye creams . M : The only one that really does the trick is a very expensive product that's been around for years and years. It's the same as what I used in the past , which is probably the best I've felt my eyes in a long time. If I were to say that it was worth the $120, I'd be lying. But at that price, I'd want to give it a try. It's the same as it's always been.

A recent study by Jodi Gilman , professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School , and Hans Breiter , from the University of Pennsylvania, reported that one in ten children with autism have some degree of gastrointestinal problems. It is likely that this problem is even worse in children with autism who receive gluten-containing formulas. The study is important in that it sheds light on the etiology of the gastrointestinal symptoms that are often observed in children with autism, although it cannot yet be considered a cause and effect situation. What Causes Autism? The search for the cause of autism has been a long and arduous process.

The most popular parks are often dog-free for a simple reason. “Most dog parks are in really bad, really poor urban neighbourhoods,” said the Toronto Police Dog Services unit commander, Sgt.

In fact, it has only been two days since the merger was approved but there are already rumors of Disney being interested in a deal with Sony.
When I was in training to be a psychologist , I never imagined that my work would come to focus on how women’s bodies and brains are constructed and how women’s bodies and minds have been used to construct the social order of our time. But this work is what I do now as an academic. And as an academic, I am not surprised by how the stories that we teach to our students are influenced by social order and how we construct the stories we tell about how women, women of colour, disabled people and queer people fit into it.

For 45 minutes , Gary Barta and Kirk Ferentz faced an overflow gathering of media and said — nothing . Not a word . Not an eye roll . Nothing . Not a word . Nothing from the former Nebraska head football coach who, in 2004, helped orchestrate the return of the NCAA to the Cornhuskers. Not from the Iowa coach who just won his sixth national championship last week. Not even a glance in Barta’s direction. And not a single word from the man who, at that moment , was standing behind Ferentz’s chair in the back of the room.

"The university administration -- which has behaved like the restaurant-goer who orders the best steak on the menu and then complains when the steaks are served medium -- continues to blame the public university system's fiscal crisis on external forces: on the Legislature for its lack of money; on the universities themselves for their inability to reduce their spending to the point that it would not be necessary for the state to make up the difference. In fact, as the Chronicle's editorial board pointed out this week, ""Most of the money to balance UC's budget is coming from UC itself."""

"In what can only be seen as a stunning reversal , the president is now refusing to release photographs that would prove he was in Afghanistan, not in New Jersey , to prove he wasn't involved with the September 11, 2012 Benghazi, Libya terror attacks which left 4 dead, including the U.S Ambassador to Libya, and 12 injured. During a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday, the president was asked about the photos. ""Well, as you know I've said before, you've got to release them,"" he told reporters at the meeting."
Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa yesterday told Parliament that the appointment of a parliamentary select committee to look into the Advanced Level results of the 2012/13 academic session would help clarify issues related to the conduct of that year’s exams. “I think that since it is a sensitive issue, we need to set it aside for a day or two, and let the relevant select committee look into this matter,” Mr. Rajapaksa said. “We have nothing to hide,” he added. “We are ready to give our answers in the manner that is most transparent to the people.

Three new products could expand Axon Enterprise 's lead in the body camera business . The last few years have seen a large number of law enforcement agencies adopt body cameras . These cameras capture video footage on or about an officer's face, allowing a court to see what an officer sees, and thus determine if an arrest was justified. Body camera sales have gone from about 1,000 cameras in 2012 to more than 30,000 in 2018 . There are over 1,000 companies making them today . While there is still a large demand for the product , many have questioned whether this is the best long-term solution.
An Israeli American gives thanks for the USA – J . When I moved to the United States from Israel, one thing I didn't expect is how different it was from home. It wasn't the food or the climate or the culture, though those things are also different; it was something much deeper than that. It was a sense of thanks, a deep sense of gratitude that we are not a third-world country but we have this incredible freedom and democracy. I didn't really understand it at first, I was just grateful to be here and I didn't have much time to appreciate it.
No offense to Lindy , but we got the creeps when we initially saw this picture of the U.K. company. A few of us even said we were going to write a letter. Now it’s over, but we do hope Lindy continues to do what they’re doing, and will continue to let us know about them. That said, I’m not one of those people who believes that there are no coincidences in the world, and I’m curious to see how this “coincidental” meeting ends up.

The fact that the archaeological excavations will continue throughout the year on the Harran ruins will contribute to the ancient history of Istanbul.

This space will not only be used by the scientific community of scholars and researchers but will be shared by the public at large.

"On a recent morning , a shirtless Franco Noriega is glistening in sweat as he hauls boxes into his new warehouse in downtown Oakland, not far from the San Leandro border . He's talking about the logistics and the politics of starting a brewery that hopes to become a national force in the Bay Area beer scene. He speaks softly and with measured deliberation. It's as though Noriega is preparing himself to make a speech. He pauses and smiles. ""I'm excited."" The warehouse is a former paint factory, and the beer is in the fermenters and on the taps."

Portal executives have touted television as a crucial advertising medium , but it seems that the tables are beginning to turn on them as the industry shifts away from the traditional model. According to a recent analysis from PricewaterhouseCoopers, television advertising growth will slow by an estimated 5% this year due to the rise in digital spending, an increase in digital ad-blocking technology and a shift toward mobile devices for video viewing. Those factors mean that traditional television advertising spending is unlikely to increase in 2020 as it has the past few years, meaning that the market for video is growing more rapidly than its ability to retain and measure that revenue.

In addition, the article also says, Chinese censors are actively preventing people from commenting on posts or even logging into Facebook from inside the country.

One of them is a bulk enrollment feature that lets organizations enroll Android devices en masse and deploy them to a new app, all in one go. This process is called “crowd-enrollment” because it makes it easier for people to download an app to their phones without knowing how or why their friends or coworkers decided to get one.

Unknown to most anglers , the right to fish hundreds of miles of waterways within New York State has hung in a state supreme court case that was argued this past summer. The case, New York vs. Environmental Conservation, could have huge ramifications for the fishing industry if it wins.

OLYMPIA – Washington might try to protect Fairchild Air Force Base and its other military installations from the congressional chopping block during budget-cutting measures by proposing a “temporary” tax on military bases. But the base could be on the chopping block as soon as the new budget year begins in two weeks if Congress doesn’t approve measures that would allow it to be transferred to the General Services Administration, where it would then have a much better chance of surviving. For years, critics have accused the base of being overburdened and in need of major structural changes.

At SUNY Schenectady , just 68 of the school 's 6,588 students received an Excelsior Scholarship . I had a scholarship. And that was it. I never received anything else. After graduating in 2005 with a 3.4 grade point average (GPA), I thought college was the easy part for me.

Wednesday ’ s announcement goes one step further by incentivizing sugar mills to divert all their sugar cane juice away from ethanol production and use it to make molasses, which can be used by the ethanol industry directly or to be converted to ethanol. In other words, the sugar industry wants ethanol producers to make molasses to be sold to them at market prices as feedstock, because that way they would get a better deal and make a lot more money off the ethanol industry (and the government) than the ethanol companies could do selling molasses as an energy source.

When disaster strikes , Democrats increasingly turn to blaming Bush rather than leading their voters through the proverbial–or literal–storm . They blame him for Katrina. They blame him for the BP oil crisis. They even blame him for the 9-11 attacks! But is there something deeper at work here?

In fact, anger has become a constant feature of the Left, as is evidenced by their reaction to the recent elections.

The Lions are in the last year of coach Justin Leppitsch's four-year tenure at the club.

HACKENSACK , N.J. -- Patrick Calello has crafted consumer products ranging from detergent bottles to high-end speakers for home theaters. Now he's looking for ways to turn around Hackensack's economy. In November, the owner of Calello Corp., a small business incubator, announced Hackensack-based businesses had received $4 million in venture capital and would receive an additional $3 million within the next three to five months.

Strengths science teaches us that every human being has powerful , natural talents in a few areas , but that this power is not fixed , it grows and diminishes . This is especially important when it comes to people with disabilities , because we can see that they often have powerful talents , but that they can't reach them . When this happens , we must help them find and develop these talents , but this is a difficult process . We can't wait until someone's disability is obvious to point to that person , because many people will not be aware of the potential they have until after a serious disability .

Keanu Reeves was reportedly very close to joining the cast of Captain Marvel as Yon-Rogg . The part obviously went to Jude Law , but it seems that Keanu was also interested in taking up the mantle. The actor has made it clear he wants to do more genre roles, and Captain Marvel would seem to be right in his wheelhouse. The movie is due in March 2018, and Reeves is expected to start shooting in August. The film stars Brie Larson, who will reportedly be on set to give Keanu pointers, and Captain Marvel is the first of four solo films she’ll be starring in this year alone.
Get all your duck eggs in a row — they ’ re delicious ! A die-hard eggovore , I never get tired of experimenting with different eggy recipes and dishes. For instance, I’ve made a simple omelet a million times, but I haven’t yet mastered a proper quiche Lorraine. For a few years, this is how I thought about eggs: they’re delicious but I don’t cook them, they’re not healthy (duh!) and I always have a hard time with making a “nice” sandwich with an open-face omelet.
With their ties loosened and shoes kicked off , the Democratic duo also vowed to forgo negative advertising in this election, which may make a huge difference in the outcome, especially in the swing states of Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. After being sworn in, Pelosi and Schumer took the podium and began their first joint news conference. It was the first public appearance for the pair since they agreed to run together, and they wasted no time attacking the Trump Administration and its policies. They vowed to fight for health care, education, affordable housing and equal pay.
For the Bruins to win games these days , sacrifices have to be made , no matter which team they are facing, it seems as if they have been doing this for the last few years. There has been so many losses that it has not been a shock for them. But this season it is different, it is a new season for a new team that is starting a new era in the history of New England college hockey. The Boston College Eagles have been a perennial power in the nation and for the last several years they have dominated their opponents with their speed, skill and depth.

In one of the largest expansions of health coverage to the uninsured , Los Angeles County is enrolling hundreds of thousands of people in private health insurance plans. County and state officials say they expect the program to be financially self-sufficient by 2014, but they don’t want to spend any more money on Medi-Cal than is absolutely necessary. With all of the money that the county is pouring into Medi-Cal, there is a good chance you are getting your medical care paid for without having to spend any money on insurance, and you’re probably getting your prescriptions, too.
Party elites just got blindsided by their own working-class voters . Can they let go of their cherished globalist beliefs to save the future of their political movement? Globalism is dead. But the left-wing intelligentsia doesn't want to accept that. They’d rather turn their heads away from reality and keep pretending globalism is alive and well. But the globalist movement is in freefall. On the eve of the 2020 presidential election, Donald Trump and his MAGA crowd are winning. Globalist politicians are on the ropes. Even Bernie Sanders, who at times has been a vocal globalist, can't seem to get a handle on this.
"While everyone is excited for a big , four-way crossover between Supergirl , The Flash , Arrow , and DC's Legends of Tomorrow , it appears the crossover may be limited to a one-off crossover. Supergirl producer Jessica Queller was on the DC's Super-Heroes stage panel during WonderCon last weekend, and said the crossover will be a one-off event, adding that the producers are looking to do more standalone episodes, not just crossovers, for their shows:

We really want to do more standalone episodes of the show, not just do crossovers."
HAS IT really been five years since Will Clark left San Francisco and took his squeaky Louisiana drawl and golden-boy looks to the Hollywood Hills? He’s the last to mention it, he says, but it has. He’s been making movies ever since and he says he’ll never leave. In fact, Clark is a man of contradictions. A big, strapping, 6-foot-plus man who moves with the lithe and graceful grace of a ballet dancer, his voice is high, husky, and soft. When he talks, he can be as soft and gentle as an old man.
ROCK FALLS , Illinois -- A two-vehicle crash killed a Rock Falls man early Sunday morning . Around 5 a.m. , police officers in a patrol vehicle were traveling east in the 3200 block of North Main Street when a white pickup truck pulled out of a driveway across the road. Officers attempted to turn around but hit the brakes and skidded into a tree. As the officers stopped, the pickup slammed into the patrol car. The driver of the pickup, who was the sole occupant of the vehicle, was thrown from the vehicle and sustained serious injuries .
Let PROF. MILLS the leader and Flag Bearer of the Party lead the march and if JJR the Founder wants to march with the Party he will be asked to do so. But it is up to him to decide. There should be only one leader at a time and the leader should act on behalf of all members. I am also a member of the National Council and I am waiting to see if we have a National President. Mills and JJR should be asked to resign as leader. They are doing a poor job, and it is clear they don't want to lead the party in the current situation.

An insurer will now be able to challenge a claim made by B.C . businessman Ron Shore after his eight-kilogram shipment of cash, stuffed inside $50,000 in $1 and $5 bills, was lost at Vancouver International Airport and left in the baggage area for two weeks. Shore made a claim for loss under his homeowner’s insurance policy in 2008 when his cash was stolen from the bag. Shore was covered under his homeowner’s policy until 2014 when, after he lost his job, Shore made a claim under his auto insurance policy for the theft of the cash, which was inside his SUV.

It was recently princess week at five-year-old Ainsley 's dance studio , so , naturally , Ainsley dressed as her favorite princess: Snow White. Ainsley's older sisters, who are also in dance classes at the studio, were dressed as Ariel and Pocahontas . Ainsley and her other classmates were dressed as fairy and pixie. I think Ainsley's best friends were dressed up as their favorite princesses, as well: one as Ariel, the other as Belle . I love that these girls are inspired by princesses, that they want to be princesses and they're proud to be princesses.
We waste time by doing a lot of little things wrong , or we take them for granted . You’d be surprised how the little details you ignore or forget to pay attention to, can make all the difference between success and failure , or mediocrity and excellence. Most people fail because they fail to plan, or they don’t follow through and complete tasks. In addition, most people make bad decisions, either because they’ve failed to analyze a situation and come up with a clear and concise decision , or they choose a decision based on emotion.

PHOENIX ( AP ) - The attorney general says a luxury hotel group is improperly receiving millions of dollars in state subsidies to operate a state-subsidized dormitory near a prison in Arizona. It is the second complaint the Arizona Attorney General's Office has filed in three weeks against the for-profit prison company running a dormitory that serves nearly 400 men at a cost of about $22 million per year. State regulators are investigating allegations that the company is receiving millions in improper subsidies and has failed to comply with the terms of a settlement agreement it signed with state corrections officials two years ago.
Following are excerpts from the inaugural address yesterday by the new President of Indonesia , B. J. Habibie , and an interview with President Habibie in Jakarta. Thank you, Mr President, for agreeing to speak with me at the opening of my party’s Congress. I’d like to make three points in a very short space. First: We Indonesians have a new President, the country is a new President. We have made the change peacefully, without bloodshed, without violence, and in the same way that Indonesia made the transition from one President to another peacefully.
"Brexit no-deal planning meant a council destroyed 17,000 of Britain 's rarest orchids in one day - and it will be repeated if Britain leaves the EU without a deal and the government can't tell them how to plan ahead, experts warned today. It came after Environment Secretary Michael Gove accused the council of ""gross negligence"" over the damage to the rare plants which are at risk from pests and disease, as the Brexit debate rages. A survey by conservation charity Plantlife last night found 17,000 orchids in one council in Essex had been destroyed over a single day."

"The name of chef Francois Mermilliod 's 45-seat restaurant is a play on the French word baratin , which means ""nonsense,"" a term that describes the food that he makes from scratch.

Northbrook/Glenview School District 30 administrators are proposing a 10 percent increase for the 2018 property tax levy , but the Board of Education is not likely to approve the measure at its Feb. 6 meeting. District administrators, however, said that if there was a delay in approving the increase for the tax levy, the board would approve the additional $2.2 million the district will be receiving from state aid, which is the amount the district lost for 2017-2018 because of a property tax freeze that was in effect for the 2016-2017 school year.

The area is called the “Alsace region,” or Alsace in French. It’s actually in the French language that the name is pronounced, not in the local Germanic tongue, because Alsace and Alsace-Lorraine were once united as one region.

Brett Squibbs has always been the younger little brother who tagged along . At 5-foot-4 and 95 pounds , he has spent the last four years waiting for his chance to get on a field. His chance has arrived. Squibbs will compete for the starting center position on Saturday as No. 8 Stanford hosts Notre Dame in its final game of the season.

New figures released by IDC on the numbers of wearables sold in Q2 2015 show that , despite the hype and the initial sales, smartwatches are still selling slower than we might have expected.

The White House 's new tools for agile-friendly acquisition are a first step , but critics still contend that federal IT agencies lack the proper skills to make the changes. The White House and its Office of Management and Budget, which oversees federal IT budgets, took the first step this week to help the agencies purchase software more quickly. The initiative will allow federal acquisition officers to use a three-stage evaluation process to evaluate and award contracts based on the cost, schedule, scope, performance and price of a software product, rather than requiring agencies to go through a lengthy approval process and then wait for the contracts to be signed.

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas made headlines when he very publicly admitted to being an undocumented immigrant in an article for The New York Daily News last year. His article, titled “My life as a secret illegal immigrant,” was a powerful, emotional expose on his life in America and his attempts to live legally and become a citizen. In an exclusive interview with The Daily Beast, Vargas talked about what it’s like living under the threat of deportation from the U.S. government—and how the recent election of President Donald Trump has made his life, and that of millions of undocumented immigrants, even more perilous.
TEHRAN – A senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander on Monday threatened Israel with destruction if it attacks Iran , state television reported, in the wake of warnings from US President Donald Trump.

On ethics and technology - we all know we have to do better , right ? Many experts – and some politicians – have been advocating for many years now for a better technology and ethical governance of new technologies like the Blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT).

We all know we have to go further.

"Several friends who read Stephen King love the eight-novel Dark Tower series . There 's been talk of a movie, but as King himself said when I interviewed him a few months ago, a movie of his books will probably never happen. ""It will never get off the drawing boards, because the books are too weird to be adapted as anything but the books themselves,"" he told me, ""because they 're more like plays than movies."" In that same interview, King discussed his relationship with Peter Straub, who has adapted most of King’s works into novels."

This new edition is heavy on talk and Deion Sanders . Did Deion Sanders jump the gun by leaking news of the book before the book was released? You can’t call the author out and then ask her to keep the book a secret…especially if her book doesn’t go the way you want. If the book is full of “facts” that can’t be disproven or verified, then there’s probably a good reason for it being leaked. We don’t expect the author or publisher to reveal secrets of the upcoming season of a football or baseball game.

A credit card was being reported lost, but the only people who knew about it were a clerk and a card company. The clerk said it seemed like a scam -- and it did.

What is Connecticut’s child poverty rate? I’ll begin with the numbers, which are shocking to everyone.

Uber is shuttering its self-driving trucks unit , a beleaguered program borne out of the company ’ s controversial multi-million-dollar acquisition of the startup Otto, a startup that had previously built self-driving tech. The company’s self-driving division, called Uber Freight, is now going away, an Uber spokesperson confirmed this morning. The Otto acquisition, made in August of 2016, ended up being one of Uber’s least-liked moves, perhaps in part because of the way the trucking program had been managed from the company’s first self-driving trucking program, called Lidar, which was launched in Arizona and ended in February.

For those who may not know, space weather refers to events that occur in our solar system (the sun, its planets, and the space between).

The BDO will be taking place this weekend, starting on Friday night (February 15) when the Scottish Open is held in Glasgow. After the Scottish Open there are two competitions, the European and the International Open, before the UK Open on February 18.

I think the most obvious difference between this team and most other teams is our lack of experience.

PETALING JAYA : More than 60 types of food items not normally consumed by Malaysians will have the Goods and Services Tax (GST) removed from them when it takes effect on 1 July.

In fact, it was the Malaysian Muslim Consumers Association that had called for the exemption on these two categories of halal-certified and Islamic-named products, saying that it would not be practical to have to check if these items are Halal or not.

Now that Lance Armstrong has lost his seven Tour de France titles and his seven consecutive victories, as well as being stripped of his seven victories at the 1996, 2000, and 2004 Olympics, he may be wondering if it's the end of a ""legacy.""

Even so , when Mr. Berkus , 44 , the interior designer , is at home in Los Angeles with his family, he is at work on a project far less familiar to most Americans: making their own wine. In Mr. Berkus' case, he makes his wine out of raisins. But his idea is the kind of counterintuitive one that endears him to people who know about wine, who drink the stuff for fun, for a toast on a holiday or a sip during an after-dinner conversation. The idea is to do something that no one has done before.

As Chivas pressed forward, Toronto were looking to hit on the break and take advantage of their numerical superiority in the centre of the park.
Tim Gideon Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker SRS-BTX300 The Sony Bluetooth Wireless Speaker SRS-BTX300 is a Bluetooth portable speaker with nice looks and solid build quality.

For the money, this speaker isn’t too bad, but if you’re looking for something to play music with, it doesn’t quite do all the things all the speakers can.

"MARTINI lovers have had a tough decade ; in 1998 , William Grimes of The Times wrote that concoctions like Martini's ""could put you off sherry for the rest of your life ."" (The Times is hardly the place to make a declaration about what we drink.) Now Martini's is the most influential cocktail of the season, even if nobody quite remembers why.

And it is all of them, and something else besides , and something more. We begin, as is the way of mystery , by asking questions of ourselves about what's going on and how we know , and how we know that we know. Who are these people? Where are they? What is this place ?
Tokyo-based journalist Nobuyuki Hayashi reported that Apple and Sony were once close to inking a deal on a Hawaiian golf resort, but Apple balked at the price. Sony had originally proposed the deal at $800 million, but Apple wanted to see that number increase by $200 million, and the company ultimately pulled out of the deal. Sony was able to acquire the land for a lower price, so it is not the end of the world for the company’s CEO, but Apple’s actions did have a positive effect on Sony’s bottom line.
The activism of students at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , Florida give us new hope for progress. Here's how. The last time that I saw Emma Gonzalez, she was still a teenager and on the verge of tears at a rally outside a state capitol in Tallahassee. She stood with the Parkland school shooting survivors — many of whom, like Gonzalez, were students — who had been staging weekly demonstrations since February to demand change and accountability from their elected representatives in response to the school shooting that killed seventeen of their fellow students and educators.

After visiting the country ’ s southern border Thursday , some have theorized that President Trump is inching closer to declaring a national emergency to secure the border. A recent poll showed a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump ’ s move, and Trump has said the government will not be shut down. But we still need to know a lot more about why Americans think the situation at the border is a big deal. To get an inside view on why this topic has become so charged in the first place, I reached out to a few folks with deep connections to the issue.

Great line about Ken Griffey Jr . But dream on . Joltin ’ Junior , as Sports Illustrated called him , hit over . 300 with a . 330 average and slugged 32 HR’s in 1980 . That was his 3rd full season , his first year as a starter , so it wasn’t much of a jump . That year was actually the year I started watching baseball , so I have vivid memories of how he looked hitting . I think he retired at the right moment , when his skills were starting to go down , but before he was too old .

The Green Line disguises the fact that Palestinians in Gaza are no longer being oppressed outside the Israeli state , but within. The Green Line, which has served as a dividing line between Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories for more than 60 years, continues to play a central role in the discourse of Israeli society, and has done so since the creation of the State of Israel. On the one hand it represents a line that has been drawn in the sand by Israel and its colonial occupiers in order to divide and conquer the native population, Palestinians in particular.
At least four protesters in southern Nepal were fatally shot and ten others injured over the weekend in clashes with police during a protest in a village outside the Nepali capital over a recent attack on a local Hindu temple. The protests, organized by a group of local Hindu leaders, broke out last month after a group of masked men armed with iron bars and knives broke into the Durga temple on Oct. 1 and vandalized it. The assailants were later identified as Hindu and Muslim hardliners who had previously carried out the recent arson attacks on local temples in neighboring India.

HONOLULU ( AP ) - The wife of a former Oahu prison guard is expected to be sentenced for bankruptcy fraud next week after a federal judge last week ruled against her husband's objections. On June 21, U.S. Magistrate Judge Steven Sumner ruled on a motion by former Oahu Correction Center Corrections Officer Steven Fong seeking a new trial because he hadn't had a chance to attend the hearing. Fong also asked to be removed from the case. However, Magistrate Sumner denied Fong's motion and ordered Fong to remain in court on July 23 to attend the sentencing hearing.
Growing shares of minority voters have not yet turned these states blue , as many in both parties had once predicted. In New Hampshire, Democrat Maggie Hassan lost to Republican Scott Brown in 2012 despite winning the state’s nonwhite electorate by a margin of 54% to 46%. And in Georgia, Democratic nominee Jason Carter lost his bid for governor in 2002 with a 53% to 46% win among African Americans, even though he won with 54% of the vote overall. To some, this is surprising.

Sometimes the simplest things are the most sublime . At a new national park lodge called Cavallo Point , a few minutes' drive from Sydney’s north shore, we had an upmarket room overlooking Sydney Harbour, complete with a deckchair and a hot tub. When we went for a morning dip in the pool, the view across the water was breathtaking. It’s a wonder that anyone ever needs to leave. But then, in the middle of our time at Cavallo Point, the view suddenly changed. For the rest of the morning – and for the rest of the week – our view was completely blocked.

Phillies skipper ’ s request for free agents fell on deaf ears . If someone told you during spring training that Carlos Santana would be playing for your team, would you have bought it? Probably not, especially if your team just made the playoffs the year before. The problem is, you can never really know whether or not your free agent signings will pan out, even when the team is having a strong season, so the “buy” button is not always an option, and even then, it’ s hard to predict just how the season will unfold.
The League of Conservation Voters will spend at least $ 40 million this election , according to its president , a sum roughly equivalent to its budget for 2016. This is a remarkable figure given that, according to a recent study by the American Conservative Union, the League’s political action committee disbursed only $ 26.8 million in contributions in 2015 and $ 7.4 million last year. The League’s spending will be funded by a $ 4.9 million transfer from the League of Conservation Voters Action Fund (LCVAF) and a $ 4.5 million donation from New Balance .

All of my professional decisions are based on the following question : Will the action or direction I take help or hurt me financially?” If it helps or hurts, I usually go with the action that will help. “Do I really need that extra pair of shoes?” If not, I either sell it, or donate it, or give it to charity. “Why do I have so many toys?” I’ll give them away. If they are still worth something to someone, they will sell it for more money.
"While Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal and Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker made headlines last summer for their declarations of war on teachers, it was another governor who was busy preparing for what he called a battle of ""the great teachers' union."" It was Rick Perry who, in February 2012, launched an effort to replace thousands of teacher jobs with privately paid, but union-free, ""charter schools."" What made Perry's crusade unique was that he was doing so with the approval of the state's top education official."
"UCLA has won three coin tosses this season , and each time , it has deferred possession — electing to punt instead of kicking it. It’s the latest in a slew of odd decisions, which has become so routine that it can only be considered an intentional act of provocation by the Bruins. It’s almost like the players are daring UCLA to do the opposite of whatever they want. For example:

— In UCLA’s game against Michigan State, the Spartans called a timeout to make sure they were in the correct formation for a kickoff."
Hatchbacks appear to be hot again , or , at least , hotter than they once were . Naturally , they appear to be hotter than ever because they have been the mainstay of Honda and Ford since the early to mid 70’s and they have remained as popular as they were in their heyday because they’re practical, durable, easy to repair , and inexpensive . But , let’s face it , over the last ten years , there hasn’t really been much to differentiate a new model , especially in their respective price ranges. .

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes hit record highs just before the opening bell Tuesday, capping one of the biggest one-day gains for both indexes in a quarter century. A combination of solid third-quarter results from financial services companies and strong consumer spending and business investment reports on Wednesday fueled gains for the broader economy and led Wall Street to declare a ""super cycle.""

HARRY REDKNAPP has rebuffed Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini ’ s transfer talk about Gareth Bale and once again insisted he is not a fan of the idea of the Wales international joining his Real Madrid-bound club. Mancini had earlier suggested Bale would be a good fit for the Spanish capital. “Bale would fit perfectly into our squad, we have some space, we need an attacking midfield player, we need someone who is quick and intelligent, who can pass and who can dribble,” the Italian said when asked in the Spanish media about the prospect of signing Bale.

Florida Football : Does Sharrif Floyd 's Adoption by Benefactor Pass Smell Test ? With high school players being marketed to colleges by high-powered public relations and marketing firms, it has become almost as big a deal as the recruitment of recruits themselves. A player who has been adopted by a benefactor, whether it be a family friend who wants to see his kid go to school at Alabama, or a college football coach who has a great connection to the player and wants him to attend a school closer to home, has every reason to want to do whatever necessary to make the arrangement work.

Host Don Lemon had a question for CNN political commentator Van Jones about President Obama‘s response to a New York Times piece by Thomas Friedman that accused him of having “abandoned“ black America . “How much has Obama done for black America since taking office?” Lemon asked. The answer, of course, was “none“: “He‘s not one of the first four presidents that came to my office, that I talked to about the black liberation movement.
Mr. Holmes is a solid ( if unremarkable ) period drama that is anchored by a great Ian McKellen performance. There are also some amusing cameos by Ian's son Patrick McNee ( as Sherlock Holmes ) and Martin Shaw ( as Watson ). While I have no doubt that some of the references will go over the heads of casual viewers, I am fairly confident that they will not be lost on the general public, and will be welcomed by people who know the stories well or are just fond of Sherlock Holmes. For the most part the film has some very good dialogue and scenes.
At least six people were arrested during a raid organized by the Ministry of Public Security on an online football betting platform on Wednesday evening.

The officials were told to make “great efforts” to protect the Kim family, and that “any wrongdoings will be dealt with by the supreme leaders of the party and the state”.

By contrast Stompers were focussed from the word go and their determination was well illustrated by the storming carries of Ciaran Lynch. The Stomper forwards took every opportunity to get to the loose ball as they had a very good game in the air to compliment their strong tackling work. It was no surprise that the Munster scrum were much better than the Scarlets forwards. The scrum was the key element of the game. The Scarlets had two scrums in the game but only one scored. It would be an exaggeration to say that every Stomper player had a good game but the following players stood out in my mind.
Gregg Sulkin might be new to the Marvel Universe , but he ’ s no stranger to working in teen dramas. With his roles as Dylan McKay on MTV ’ s Sweet/Vicious (1999) and later on the ABC Family ’ s Greek (2004), the British actor may be the last man you expect to see on the big screen taking on the likes of Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth or Chris Pratt in Marvel Studios ’ most anticipated film, Iron Man 3. But it ’ s certainly a welcome return to the genre for Sulkin.

On July 14 , 2018 , Cuba ’ s new president Miguel Díaz-Canel addressed the closing session of the Union of Cuban Writers. His speech, the first to be made by a president of the republic in 17 years , was remarkable in so many respects, among them, in the manner in which it was presented by the authorities, the content, the brevity of his discourse, and the number of points he managed to touch upon, without losing his cool. In addition to the usual political and ideological references, the speech was punctuated by references to cultural themes, including those of a personal nature.

Why the House committee chose to support just eight additional aircraft is unclear . One reason could be budget pressures. According to the report, the FAA has projected an approximately $6 billion funding gap between 2020 and 2023, and has proposed $1.2 billion to address the problem. But the FAA could also have decided to wait a few years and see if the budget problems resolve on their own. The report doesn't elaborate on what the agency plans to do with that money. The report comes less than a month after Boeing announced a $170 billion investment in 737 Max production .

As trained medical-care professionals , EMS paramedics serve as an initial emergency response when time is of the essence and a quick assessment is required in order to treat the patient. The role of an emergency physician in the United States is different than in other countries, where emergency physicians generally have a large degree of autonomy in terms of patient assessment and treatment decisions. However, in the United States an emergency medicine physician is a doctor that specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening illness or injury to patients of all ages, from newborns to adults. The scope of an emergency medicine specialist's practice varies.

A teenager who had been given just two weeks to live before a heart transplant died after doctors misdiagnosed her disease as a cold and she went without treatment. Hannah, whose family asked for her identity not be made public, died on February 19, a week after she had been taken to hospital with a fever.

The traveler had very little if any contact with the airline or the hotels or the tour operator. Today air travel and the vacation packages that go with air travel is a much different experience . Air travel now involves more than just taking off and landing . Today there are tours that take the traveler from one exotic city to another , tours of Europe and of the United States as well .

Americans feel more stress than ever , a new survey found . Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that older Americans feel the pressure more than younger ones, and women report greater anxiety than men. As a psychologist, the findings are not surprising to me. But they are certainly cause for concern: More stress can lead to more illnesses, which can lead to higher healthcare costs. Americans are also more stressed than any other nation in the world, according to a major international survey of stress published last month. Our stress levels are on par with war-torn countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria.

What would you do if your 15-year-old developed an obsession with spray tanning ? Hang on , let me define this for you.

"In the summer of 1899 , a band of New York newsboys led a strike against the editor of the World newspaper. They walked out of their jobs and demanded higher wages. The paper printed editorials arguing for their cause. This was the time of the “New Journalism.”

Newspapers were being invented at a frantic pace during this period . They were making money hand over fist — more than a hundred papers were founded and published during the 1890s. With this growth came innovations and experimentation, especially in reporting and layout. The World’s publisher, Joseph Pulitzer , wanted to do things his own way."

The bishops in the House of Lords - along with a motley assortment of politicians there - have displayed a total lack of moral leadership and a cowardly refusal to acknowledge their own complicity in what is arguably the biggest scandal since the sex abuse scandal of the 1980s.

In the incident, which resulted in a loss of life, the pilot ejected over Syria and was apparently rescued by Syrian regime forces and brought to a nearby base.
Amidst the rambling homes and cobble-stoned streets of the Georgian capital Tbilisi 's old town , two stone churches stand side by side. To the north-west of Tbilisi's main square, Rustaveli Avenue, these two churches face each other, separated by no more than a small square with a tree. One, St George's Cathedral , has been around for well over a millennium. It was constructed at a time when the city was being reborn after a period of relative stagnation during which many of its citizens had fled abroad to pursue a life of piety and scholarship at the Georgian capital of Kutaisi .
With my new chart layout , the Archer C5400 sits right near the middle in LAN to LAN at 941Mbps. I was surprised to see how close it came to the R7 250. At 946Mbps , I think the R7 250 will be right in line. The R5 1600 was the only other card in the chart to come close at 941Mbps. At the very least, I'm pleased with how the Archer C5400 performs. I'm still trying to figure out all the nuances of the new chart as I'm not at all sure which number is what.
Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority are undermining democracy . Only a new generation can bring real change . Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas must change direction or face being outflanked by his young rival, Mahmoud “popular” Sisi, in the Arab world, and even in Egypt.

"There may be some debate between baseball and football fans as to which game is America 's game . However, no debate will ever exist that football is more popular than baseball. In fact, if you want to talk about sports in America, the first question you 'd probably ask would be, ""Who do you like best, football or baseball ?"" Of course, the correct answer would probably be, ""Football !"" But, what I 'm saying is that most people who claim to like baseball , or claim that they love the game , are lying."

When Apple reports second-quarter results on Tuesday , investors will hone in on revenue , earnings per share , and iPhone sales, as usual.

To that end, we looked back through more than two decades of iPhone and Apple earnings results to find out whether analysts have accurately forecasted Apple's results and if the company has had a winning streak over the course of the iPhone cycle.

Put this one in the category of good ideas , disingenuous sources . According to Xinhua , the Chinese government wants to increase the proportion of local people in senior management positions. The original idea was that those positions would go to local citizens . But that's only half the story . The real reason is that senior managers who come from the province are loyal to the province . And since they're not willing to do what the Party tells them, the only option for Party leaders to increase their own influence is to recruit people who come from the provinces .
Yesterday I realized that all of my best relationships - professional personal , familial - have one thing in common. They are all based on love. What I also realized, was that love is a process. And that process is not something that is going to happen once and then be over with. The more love that I give the more love that the other person is going to give to me. In order for us to continue to have a relationship we must give love. Love has a rhythm. I am realizing this today as I read this article about love.

Far too many military families will spend this holiday season , and many more , with an empty seat at the dinner table. Too many soldiers and sailors and airmen and women will go without presents because of financial hardship. This is a critical time of the year.

While the holiday season has its own tradition of gift giving, there are other, more important, things to do during this time.

The Medicare program imports approximately $ 100 billion a year in medical equipment and prescription drugs . Nearly all of that comes from United States manufacturers. Under current rules, manufacturers can sell their goods to the United States Government for about 20% less than the retail prices charged in the market. The government then resells them back to the public, at the same wholesale prices. The net result is that American taxpayers are paying twice as much for the same goods as they would if manufacturers were required to price their products in the market, allowing competition to drive prices down.

Berries are a low-calorie filling for pie . With its buttery pastry crust and high amounts of sugar , pie can pack a serious calorie punch. Instead, use a filling made of berries or other low-cal fruit. For instance, try raspberry or strawberry slices in the pastry crust. Or try fresh fruit such as sliced plums and apples. Or, use frozen fruit and thaw it before placing in the pie. A good rule is to fill no more than a third of the pie crust with fruit. Don't be afraid to experiment.

JP Morgan . Goldman Sachs . Bank of America Merrill Lynch . Morgan Stanley . A handful of well-known Wall Street firms account for about 75 percent of global foreign-exchange trading volume.

But because so few people on the street are knowledgeable about the markets or the world's financial plumbing, these firms are not always easy to explain.

`` Saturated Semiconductor Optical Amplifier Phase Modulation for Long Ra '' by Jennifer L. Carns , Bradley D. Duncan et al . This paper presents saturated semiconductor optical amplifier phase modulation for long reach communications. Long-range transmission over a fiber optic link demands low-cost, low-power, and high performance optical devices that can tolerate a large number of amplifying cycles at the transmitter. Recently, several authors have suggested that it is possible to create a stable, high-amplitude optical signal with a nonlinear semiconductor laser by amplifying only a small fraction of the signal. The approach described here uses a diode laser that is biased such that it exhibits a small threshold gain.

The panel will have the power to reduce their ranking – from the current 77th to 72nd or lower – and ban the players from international duty.

Just think of it as a collection of B-Sides from Dark Side Of The Moon . Creating an album is hard enough, and if it’s good it takes you about a month. If you want to do all the “easy” B-Sides, you can take three weeks. If you really want to do all of them, you’re in for at least a month, or even longer. The reason I’ve waited so long, was because they’re really hard to find, even on YouTube.

About 11.30am last Tuesday , within moments of each other , Asma al-Mughair , 16 , and her brother Ahmed al-Mughair , 21 , were stabbed to death. It would be years before their murder became the defining moment in the conflict between Gaza’s Islamist leaders and its people. Their killing, in broad daylight outside their home in Beit Lahiya in the north-eastern Gaza Strip, was a watershed moment in a conflict that has killed more than 1,700 Palestinians, the vast majority in Gaza, and wounded 13,000. It was, perhaps, inevitable that their murder would become emblematic.

Most biotech startups begin with university researchers and are later acquired or sold by larger companies that have more money and experience .

Now, with the rise of two new biotech investment groups — one in Boston and the other in London — the industry is beginning to attract a different sort of entrepreneur.

JUST a week after it was installed the Boscombe Police Box was still drawing in curious onlookers .

A defined contribution plan is a retirement option that lets an employee -- and sometimes his or her employer -- contribute money from his or her pay toward retirement. With these plans, it’s all about the math. If your employer contributes less than you would have otherwise, then the difference could go to you in the form of a retirement benefit. For example, if the total compensation package is $45,000 per year but your employer contributes $40,000, then that’s $5,000 you’re not contributing.

The flat seas couldn ’ t last forever on the Caribbean side ; it finally kicked up a bit but not much. We headed north along the coast. It was a nice day, not too hot or cold, the seas were quite calm. After a while we passed by a beach and I was amazed at what I saw : the sand was completely different. It was a mix between white and pink, like a mixture of chalk and baby powder. As we went further the pink became stronger, and as soon as we rounded the cape the sand was almost completely pink.

Starbucks is banning straws – but is it really a big win for the environment ? The coffee giant has pledged to eliminate the straws – which can be up to 10 times as environmentally harmful as the cup – from all of its 8,600 global stores. The move is intended to “save millions of trees” and reduce plastic pollution in the oceans, the company’s new chief executive has said. However, it may not actually achieve those goals. The move is expected to save Starbucks up to 1.9m cups of waste every year. In other words, that’s not very much.
I got a little perturbed while watching the film “ Hidden Figures , ” which tells the story of African-American women who were essential to the American space program at the dawn of the Cold War . As the first African-American female engineers, they worked as computing operators at a segregated NASA facility, the Goddard Space Center, for decades until their contributions were finally acknowledged in a new NASA film and the naming of a spaceflight center in their honor. The film was based on a 2015 article written for The New Yorker by Margot Lee Shetterly, who was one of the three women profiled, Katherine Johnson.

The creator sat with Comic Riffs for an exclusive hour-long interview on his life, career and the future of Image Comics. You started out working as an editor, how did you get to be an artist?
"At the Kurtz Training Center in Bethlehem where the mentally handicapped are trained for the work place , pipe clamps are used to restrain the patients who have learned to manipulate them

Pipe clamps were one of those things I always wanted as a kid. You could see them everywhere in my neighborhood in Pittsburgh. My dad was kind of an odd guy.

SEOUL , South Korea – U.S . Forces Korea said Thursday it has received `` multiple reports '' of fake North Korean missiles hitting South Korea and is monitoring the situation. The statement came a day after an apparent North Korean missile attack from a submarine was reported in the Yellow Sea between North Korea and the South and shortly after Pyongyang warned Seoul it was preparing for a military operation to capture Seoul. South Korea's military said North Korea launched two ballistic missiles on Monday that flew toward Japan before veering south into waters near its maritime border with South Korea and that Seoul had shot them down.

In the last two months , suicide bombings by Chechens have killed over a hundred people ( most of the time, young men, women and children) , and injured hundreds of others, in Daghestan, Ingushetia and Chechnya. In fact, most of them have been killed by the Russians , and most of the Russians killed are by Chechens, according to Russian officials.

Remember that one time someone put a Lime Bike atop the Virginia Street Bridge back in June ? It got a lot of publicity and was a neat idea . It even made the news . And then just last week, the City put up a poster with a couple photos of the “Lime Bike” and a bit of text about it . But a couple days ago a Lime Bike was stolen from outside a building at 1350 W Virginia Street and, apparently, the Lime team was not aware of the bike being stolen.

Q : That all makes sense when looking at the United States , but why are residents of previously impoverished countries like Mozambique , Zimbabwe or the Congo moving to Brazil? JF: One of the reasons why is because the population growth in other developing countries is slower than in Brazil . But Brazil is a huge country and some areas are so poor that people are coming from everywhere to get away from it. The reason why I’m not too worried about it is that people are coming here to find jobs. They aren’t coming just for the weekend or going on holidays.

To survive Trump/Pence rout of American Constitutional laws , caregivers of reason need become America 's global healing force for all. This will take time , but as a first , they must become a global network of caring, loving individuals and groups. Trump is a man who knows how to manipulate public opinion , but does not respect it . He must be defeated at all costs , even at the price of democracy. The global care-givers of American democracy need to protect American Constitutional laws against Trump/Pence power grab in the name of National security .
With Barack Obama gracing the halls of Naypyidaw this week , the world has quite rightly been calling loudly for an explanation on Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya population. This is the first year of the new President’s five-year term, during which the Rangoon government seems determined to up the ante with its brutal campaign against the Muslim minority. In 2016, an estimated 655,000 Rohingya left their country to seek refuge in neighboring Bangladesh. And so on the same day Obama arrived for a two-day visit, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the Myanmar government to account for its brutality against the Rohingya.

He also criticised the group for ""failing to fulfil its duties"", adding: ""If you fail to act responsibly in these circumstances, you might find yourself answering to the European Parliament for a breach of EU law."""
Pretending to be someone you trust ( your mortgage company , your bank , a government official , a family member or your partner ) is one of the most common tactics used by conmen .

The 23rd-ranked Buffalo Bulls will try and rebound from a loss their last game today when they host the Central Florida Knights in the first of two regular season games. Last night’s result wasn’t the start that the Bulls were looking for, but they are still ranked in the top 10 in the country. However, they have to contend with the nation’s leader in points per game, the nation’s second-best rebounding defense and the nation’s best shooting team. UCF comes into today’s game with a record of 18-1 and the Bulls are only 17-4 on the year.
When you look back at your career , do you see a distinct plan unfolding or a bunch of random choices you made based on how the world worked in those days? I see lots of random decisions, which is actually a blessing. If you could do it all again, would you make the same choices? Probably not. I don't see life in any way as a linear process, where there's only one way to go. I don't believe that, but I've seen it in my clients, too.

GOP tax plan hits upper middle class hard , and that ’ s bad for Mass . President Donald Trump and Republican leaders are trying to push through a plan to cut the corporate rate to 15 percent while slashing taxes for the rich, including a steep reduction in the income tax rate on the wealthiest Americans. It would be a devastating blow to the middle class in Massachusetts, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based think tank, with the state losing nearly a quarter of its tax revenue.

Al Jolson . Photo : wiki commons . In 1927 , The Jazz Singer ushered out the era of silent films . And it also made moviegoing more affordable for a wider audience.

Old , outdated equipment also tends to have old , outdated software – and that means that new , updated versions are often necessary to make it run well. With the increasing number of software manufacturers , you'll need to keep an eye out for software updates , just as you would with any other system component. But before you make the leap and purchase new and up to date computers , one thing to consider is whether to upgrade the existing computers you have in place . There are times when it may be better to replace the old hardware with a new model so that you can get newer , improved features.

All-Rounders have proved to be a vital part of the IPL franchise over the years . What makes them more special than other players is the fact that they can do everything pretty well. From scoring to catching, bowling to fielding, you name it. In the IPL, an All-Rounder is often referred to as a player who is a ‘jack of all trades’. While some of them might be good with their batting, they are not necessarily known for their pace. They are usually a man who can bat well in both the top and middle order or bowl a bit with the new ball.

Place : Point Reyes Station , Calif . This triple cream cheese is named after Mount Tamalpais in Marin County and is the result of a special combination of cheesemaking skills and knowledge of dairy products. The result is a rich, creamy cheese with a delicate, mild, sweet and nutty flavor, and a texture similar to mascarpone. It is available in the Northern California region of the United States. I bought some for a cheese and cracker plate, and my whole family said it was the best cracker topping I had ever made. I will never make my own crackers again!

Dramatic diets for the sake of on-screen authenticity are most frequently associated with Western screen stars Christian Bale or Matthew McConaughey, but Hollywood has a long-established history of turning to low-cal diets for its leading men. In the 19th century, British and American actors regularly took to drinking raw eggs or guzzling a pint of raw cream in an attempt to stay in shape for their roles — and they’ve done the same ever since. Here’s the lowdown on some of the worst actors in Hollywood history and what they ate and drank to look the part.
The airport 's non-police security force believes the change would harm public safety . Long Beach and its Police Department say the city needs the change because it would save more than $2 million . But some airport workers, who fear losing their jobs, fear the change is the thin end of the wedge in airport privatization. As a result of the new law, airport security will no longer be performed by the police department but by airport security forces, which are now working for the city . Airport security will be under the Department of Homeland Security.

Surprising data show that in many places marshes protect shorelines better than walls and are cheaper to construct . Scientists have always known that marshes were a natural way to control erosion, but they didn’t know exactly how they worked. The answer to this mystery lies in the microbial life that colonizes the marsh edges and helps keep shorelines free of sediment. A new study in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology details a new way to protect shoreline areas that are susceptible to coastal erosion, by establishing marshlands near the shore in order to create a more robust microbial community.

Amazon employees better start practicing the Vulcan salute . Their boss Jeff Bezos has landed a cameo role in the upcoming movie Iron Man III, and will be joined by Robert Downey Jr. and co. as they fight the bad guys.

2 Chainz has a nimble flow and can churn out creative bits of wordplay with the best of them . . . but it’s the song that’s got me thinking, not his flow, which, while interesting, has a tendency to wander into territory that isn’t always relevant to his overall style of rhyming. “I Don’t Play That” is the song where Chainz really shines, though. It starts out as just an acoustic guitar, but by the time it hits its chorus you’d be surprised that there’s anything other than the lyrics on the page.
According to reports , President-elect Donald Trump has tapped recently retired Marine General James Mattis to be his secretary of defense, the Pentagon’s top position.

The U.S. war in Afghanistan has been going on for almost 16 years, and there are more U.S. troops in the country today than in the entire period from the 9/11 attacks to the withdrawal of ground forces at the end of 2014.

In marketing , we create personas that are static and think about the customer journey as linear -- from discovery to purchase. But the reality is that most customer journeys don't have a start, middle and end. The customer journey is made up of multiple phases that are influenced by a mix of external forces, like their location, interests, and personal characteristics. It's also made up of personal choices (like what and where to buy) that may occur multiple times throughout their purchase process. The result is that customers may go back and forth to different phases of the decision process multiple times.

But these grim statistics, compiled in the annual roundup by the international Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), are just part of the grim picture. The CPJ‘s annual count, based on data it has gathered and published since 1986, is one of the most comprehensive reports of how dangerous it is to work in the news business.

He was an ex-hippie with an accent from somewhere exotic and vaguely exoticised by American culture, he’d lost his job in the army and ended up having to work in a rock club.

Ten Network is apparently keeping its buddies in the US , and their landslide of TV content , very close to the vest.

But then it's also likely that they already know which shows would work. It would explain why they're in such high spirits , but we're going to assume that there's no smoke without fire at this stage.

"It ’ s dumb mistake that almost all elected officials succumb to at one time or another , but with a little time to reflect , we all have made mistakes we wish to undo . At that point when we find ourselves regretting the past , its time to look in the mirror and ask the self important question , “Why did I do that ?” and “Why do I do the things I do”

"Review : Slither | ScreenRant I was really looking forward to watching Slither . It looked like one of those movies that you would see on SyFy. There were a bunch of really cool creatures in the movie along with a cool villain. Unfortunately, Slither was nothing more than what it showed, a low grade horror/scifi movie with really bad CGI. It didn't even have enough thrills to keep your interest. The acting was sub-par in the movie. The story was very predictable, with everything falling in place just before it was time to finish."

Richie Phillips , the longtime labor leader of Major League Baseball 's umpires , lost another round in his battle against the sport's owners. Phillips and his union, the Major League Umpires Association, took a second strike vote on Tuesday, with a majority of his colleagues rejecting a contract the owners had offered the umpires in mid-June. The vote came just days before the regular season began, which could have cost umpires, who are paid a pittance and work an average of 80 games a year, at least another month's work and maybe an additional season of work in 2018.

Outgoing Foreign Minister Don McKinnon today expressed serious concern at the recent Russian ultimatum that civilians should leave Chechnya ’s two southern republics to allow for more military incursion into Chechenya by Russian Armed Forces. “This ultimatum is a clear violation of international humanitarian law. It is clearly a tactic aimed at using fear as a political tool. This should be viewed as a threat to peace in the region, not a positive step,” McKinnon said. “Russian forces have been carrying out a war of terror in Chechenya, targeting hospitals and schools.

CBN.com  My wife , Cathy , and I stared at each other in disbelief as our oldest daughter , Kelly , was about to graduate from high school and we wondered what lay ahead for us. After Cathy had spent several years struggling to get back on her feet after being injured by a runaway car and losing the man I had hoped would be my partner for life , I had left our marriage in order to protect both of our daughters. A short while later, I was sitting in a hospital waiting to find out if I had suffered a permanent injury.
At a time when the Lakers need Lonzo Ball more than ever to step up with Rajon Rondo out recovering from Achilles surgery and LeBron James out on a short leave of absence, they may be more than a little bit worried. The Lakers are in a strange place this season. No team in the league has played as inconsistently as they have. There are nights when they look like the NBA champions and other nights when they look like they should be preparing for another summer of change. This has been one of those strange weeks.

Few Jews can approach German unification without caution , given the searing emotion of a people who lost 6 million of their brethren, as well as their own lives and cultural identity, in World War I. However, they also recognize that there are some things they cannot let go of, things which, even a century later, define who they are as Germans and who they are as Jewish Germans. In recent years, these questions have become more sensitive than ever. The first major exhibition about German Jewish history and culture to open in Berlin for some 40 years, the recently-completed Das Judentum im 19.

During the Arab Spring , a lot of the footage coming out of Tunisia , Egypt and Libya wasn ’t the sort that the mainstream media had been hoping to cover . Instead, the majority of reports and footage from those countries came from people on the ground, from the people who were protesting. This meant that, for a lot of people, there was a real appetite for more news from those areas and this is what sparked a whole host of new news channels, websites, Facebook groups and even mobile apps, looking to get the news from a place where the mainstream press was missing out.
The New York Times was published in Thailand with a front page story missing because a printer refused to publish it, because it had a photograph of the King. That's censorship, of course. Yet in the US, even the New York Times has a page 3 that's missing every morning because a few editors don't want the story printed there either. This story was originally published at Digg and has been republished here on Digg with the permission of the author. It's interesting to look at what is and is not censored in the news.

When Donald Trump called for arming teachers in 2015 , he was met with the expected derision from gun control supporters and the media, but his proposal was greeted with enthusiasm by teachers and other gun owners. Many school districts were ready to take the lead in providing firearms to their teachers, but they couldn’t do it under a law that requires the principal of a public school to have a concealed weapons permit for every school where guns are on the premises. In 2016, however, that barrier was lifted and school districts were free to arm teachers .
When the United Nations seeks outside financial assistance either for development needs or to advocate social causes , it invariably turns to governments in Europe and North America. The reason for this has a long history, dating back to the United Nations founding in 1945. After the war, the US and the other Western countries in the UN Security Council saw the UN as a tool for the pursuit of a liberal agenda on economic, social and political issues. To them, it seemed self-defeating for the United States, the world's most powerful nation, to also become the world's leading financial power.

Chances of a government shutdown grew Monday as Republicans concluded that they would be unable to reach a long-term spending agreement with President Barack Obama and blamed the White House for failing to negotiate. Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told his House Republican conference that the Senate had reached a bipartisan budget deal that would avert a government shutdown next week — but the White House would not negotiate and instead called it a “bad deal” from which he would not approve. “The American people should be ashamed of what they did to us today,” Boehner said, according to The Associated Press, referring to the White House.
"DENVER — Jamal Murray just could n't get the bad taste out of his mouth , and even a bite from an NBA All-Star wouldn't have fixed that.

""Just go back to my work,"" Murray said Wednesday at the Pepsi Center as the Blazers returned to the site of the franchise's first playoff game."

"Just one day after Relativity Television formally relaunched as Critical Content , the company has landed its first greenlight with a new genre comedy series from Universal TV, NBC and FremantleMedia. “There’s just something about this project we’re developing that we’ve been working on and developing for a long time, and now the opportunity to develop it further at this point and to work with Relativity and Fremantle, we couldn’t pass up the opportunity,"" said NBC Entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt in announcing the pick-up of the project."
On the evening Donald Trump announced his supreme court nominee , thousands of protesters gathered outside of Senate minority leader Charles Schumer's home in New York to rally in support of Judge Neil Gorsuch, who, according to news reports, was a favorite of the Democrats. I spoke to a protester outside Schumer's house. The first thing we need to acknowledge is that Donald Trump won. He won. He got the popular vote by a clear margin. Donald Trump is the president of the United States. What does it mean? We're at a critical moment in American history.

On Aug. 25 , the Chinese-language Liberty Times ( the Taipei Times ’ sister newspaper ) published an article that I translated a couple of days ago. The article was written by the paper’s Beijing-based reporter , Yang Hui-che (杨暉哲). The article is called, in English: “ Taiwan must recognize that it is an illegal entity” ( 台灣不可拿為奪權的國家 ). I translated the article for this blog because it is an excellent example of the many lies spread in the mainstream media on the topic of Taiwan and the Republic of China, or ROC.
Finding alternative gas suppliers and routes has become a matter of national security and key priority for Europe , Bulgaria has been building a network of gas pipelines to diversify its supply and reduce the risks of interruptions in supplies caused by geopolitical or economic disturbances. The first key gas link, the Nabucco Project, which connects Bulgaria to Turkey and on to Europe , was signed in 2002 and is being implemented as planned. The Nabucco Project involves the construction of a single pipeline to transport gas from Azerbaijan across Turkey , Bulgaria and Serbia , and to Europe . The project is funded by the European Commission.
The Bush Administration has tried to downplay the mounting danger posed by North Korea . That might be the understandable outcome of the world’s most bellicose and corrupt regime, but that would be to miss the danger. North Korea is a real threat, not an empty one. And, if we are to take the administration seriously, we must be ready to use every tool at our disposal. The North Koreans have demonstrated their ability to develop a nuclear weapon. They have the means to deliver that weapon to the United States.
Eclipsing men , women and children now comprise 55 percent of refugees entering Europe . The growing number of Syrian families fleeing their country is putting strain on host countries , with some European states struggling to cope even as refugees continue arriving. European Union leaders meet today (Feb. 16) for a second time in a week to discuss the migrant crisis.

Let ’ s face it : NYU students drink during Welcome Week . Despite the university ’ s well-intentioned attempts to create an alcohol-free campus, there ’ s a good chance that at least one student will find themselves falling off the wagon the first day of classes . As a parent with a daughter currently attending her freshman year of school at NYU, I was surprised and a little worried to learn that not only do students drink on NYU ’ s campus, they ’ ve even figured out the best way to get alcohol in their dorms: through the air duct .

Government and industry should work closely together to ensure success as the market evolves . Automakers need standards for key technologies and safety features, and governments need to set those standards. For example, all vehicle manufacturers have been required to meet certain fuel economy requirements, and many have set similar goals for CO 2 emissions, which are directly related to energy use. The goal of establishing a national strategy is to ensure that we have a transportation system that is ready for the future and that our society can continue to flourish and develop as we do.

We spend a lot of time , criticising our Canadian federal , provincial , municipal and First Nations politicians , the media , academia and most importantly each other. This is because, no matter what we do , how much we accomplish or what we believe , our politicians will always be wrong and our fellow citizens will always be wrong. The problem with most people is they think they know the answers and they don't understand the questions , and if you understand the questions , that is the only real requirement to find a solution.

Why does psoriasis increase diabetes risk ? Previous research demonstrated that having psoriasis increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but it was unclear whether this risk was greater than that attributable to lifestyle factors. The current study, which appears in JAMA Network Open, provides new insight by comparing how much the risk of developing type 2 diabetes varies across people with psoriasis and people without the disease. The researchers analyzed data collected from the National Health Survey of more than 9.2 million adults aged 20 years or older from 1999 to 2012 to compare the risk of diabetes in adults with psoriasis with that in adults without the condition.

A three-month tour to visit Korean War veterans and Korean War memorials in all 50 states got started at stop number 10 on a tour of North America this past week. The tour was sponsored by North America’s largest network of Korean War Veterans Groups. Veterans were invited to join in a discussion about the War and about their own experiences. The questions posed during the discussions were: How did you first learn that the war was over and where did you find out the war was over? And what did it mean for you when you first heard the announcement?
DENVER -- Should marijuana be delivered to homes just like pizza or Chinese food in Colorado ? The debate is heating up again in the Centennial State with the start of the recreational sales of the herb. But how to best deliver pot to consumers -- in the privacy of their own home -- has been a hot topic, especially after Colorado's police chief called marijuana deliveries a public safety threat last year. Denver's police chief said last year the delivery of pot -- especially in neighborhoods -- can put children and innocent people in harm's way.

I’ve done some searching and I think there is a website that has all the street views in a single page.
Police have refused to speculate on any link between the shooting of a man in South London last night and the fatal attack on an officer in London Bridge last week. The 39-year-old man, believed to be part of the same gang who stabbed to death a policewoman last Friday, was shot and killed in Plumstead at about 11.30pm last night. Scotland Yard said today that three men, aged 18, 21 and 42, were arrested on suspicion of murder at the scene. Officers from the Met's Trident and Area Crime Command are leading the investigation.
A new study shows that moms with breast cancer who previously breastfed have a lower chance of that cancer returning. This study shows that breastfeeding during pregnancy or early in the first year after a mother is diagnosed with cancer doesn’t reduce the risk of her getting the disease again. The study, published in the current issue of Clinical Cancer Research, is one of the first studies that has looked at breastfeeding during pregnancy or after pregnancy and the risk of cancer recurrence. Researchers say that more studies like this are needed to help inform future recommendations regarding breast cancer survivors.
How about some GOOD news about Tesla 's Autopilot feature for a change ? Apparently some guy suffering from a rare form of dementia, who has no clue about what he is talking about, managed to get the car he was in to kill a woman and himself with no intervention of the driver. If you want to see the footage of this horror, watch the below video . It is really heartbreaking to see these two people get killed and it seems as though it could have been avoided if Tesla had the foresight to implement the feature that warns the user of a collision in the near future.
Libertarian congressman Justin Amash : Critic of NSA , immigration , budget deal . The libertarian congressman on NSA , the budget deal and a possible Trump presidency. (CNN) It's been a long, long road for Rep. Justin Amash. He's the only Michigan Republican in Congress.

And then, of course, came Trump . In other words, Amash's voting record is almost impossible to decipher.

The official ad for this Leavenworth pad says `` full-sized closet , '' for sure a rare treat in efficiency-oriented Kansas City. The floorplan is simple enough; a kitchen opens to the left, and there's a powder room with a tub to the right. That's the only bathroom on the 1,100-square-foot floor, so the master suite with a double sink and jetted bathtub is likely to be used more often than the second bedroom or the office. There is a wood-burning fireplace, hardwood floors and plenty of natural light. Even the price tag is reasonable, given the spaciousness.

Samuel Goldman writes well about the value of “ traditional ” education ( read : classical education ) and studying the great classics of Greek and Roman literature and philosophy. But in his recent book “Why Liberalism Works: A Brief History of How Free People Have Remade Themselves,” published in 2012 by the New Press, he notes that in the United States, “liberalism has become synonymous with secularism, a belief that God is the source of our rights, liberties, and duties.” What does this tell us about the value of classical education? What does this tell us about Christianity?
Google is continuing to slowly trickle new features down to users of its AI-powered messaging app Allo . This week, one of the lesser known ones is now available to all users in an experimental beta version. And it’s a pretty neat addition.

The bungled handling of the requirements of the Child Soldier Prevention Act last week is a clear and disturbing sign of failure of the Obama administration and the UN to do the job. This law requires the UN to investigate the alleged use of children in the wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Darfur. “I am deeply worried that these children will be victims of further atrocities if the Security Council doesn’t fulfil its responsibility to protect these children,” said Louise Arbour, the top UN official in charge of children.

The Associated Press Chris Archer was a two-time American League All-Star for the Tampa Bay Rays . PITTSBURGH — Pittsburgh Pirates left fielder Gregory Polanco will return to the lineup for Thursday night's home game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Polanco missed his second consecutive game Wednesday night at Cincinnati with an oblique strain. He last played Sunday against the San Diego Padres.

Pittsburgh is 4-11 since Sept. 10, including a 9-2 run over the past five games.
No one will know what kind of impact Ridge Wilson will have on UK football as a true freshman until next season, and that’s a fantastic thing. At 6-foot-4, he’s very big and athletic and he could be more of a big play threat than most UK quarterbacks are. What you’re seeing, though, is the kid who has a real chance to become a superstar. He’s a leader, someone who is not afraid to take charge. He makes his own throws. He can run. He can play with his eyes downfield.

When the royal commission roadshow has finished , there is every likelihood that it will be business as usual for the Liberal party. The only question is how long it takes before the government falls. For now, the prime minister and his deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, remain confident that the government can hold on, despite having lost the trust of more than half the country. But if they lose their majority in the House of Representatives in the election that is due by October, the political and economic wreckage will be far greater than anyone had anticipated.
It was awfully sweet of the US Congress to condescend to vote for not sending the US and the rest of the world down the road to ruin in the form of a massive debt bomb. Not that they can do anything about it, even if they wanted to. The world is so much richer than the USA that there's no sense in complaining about how much the US has taken out of the global pie. You don't understand how the whole global economy works. It isn't just that America is rich and the rest is poor.

I thank America for its reflection on the homely ( as the Irish mean it ) spirituality of fatherhood depicted in this video I am sure it will give birth to more reflection and even more good works. I would just like to take this time to remind those who may not have seen this clip that God made us all equal as he made each of us a unique child. I am reminded of this today because I saw this little boy at the end of the video crying because he was tired and wanted his daddy and mommy.

The world must act to contain the risk of another devastating housing crash , the International Monetary Fund warned on Thursday. After a recent sell-off of stocks and bonds, some are already talking about another 1929. The crisis in housing was at the epicentre of the 2008 financial crisis. While some experts have argued the 2008 crisis was not a true collapse but just a slow burn, the latest data from Canada and the United States seems to back their argument. Homeownership rates remain near historic lows, real-estate construction and home prices remain stagnant, and the housing market remains vulnerable to another crisis.

LAS VEGAS > > Ronda Rousey ’ s 16-second victory over Alexis Davis on Saturday night at UFC 175 wasn’t all that close.

After all, this wasn’t her first time submitting the Brazilian veteran in the first round; it was just the first time she did it without using a rear-naked choke. “It was just the first time,” said Rousey.
Too bad Colorado Springs has been shown to actually be one of the most educated cities in the country , it is not even close.

The novel does explore various types of relationships — romantic , familial , friendships — but they serve as a background for the story, and it doesn't seem as though it has much to say about relationships in particular. There's a pretty big problem in this novel as well. It's basically impossible for a novel to be set in the 18th century and yet to be totally set in the near future. The book takes place in 1782, which is roughly the year the United States declared independence from Great Britain. It takes place in Boston, which was originally an American colony, in 1772.

A new report finds that these students graduate from selective colleges at higher rates than first-time freshmen . There ’s a reason why so many of them graduate from Harvard and Yale: They come from well-off families who can pay for high-quality schools with little sacrifice. For the rest of America’s college freshmen, there ’s another option. They don’t have to be from wealthy families to attend the best schools and, if they are from a lower socioeconomic background, they ’ll pay less. They can go to community college, where the average full-time student graduates within four years.

Donald Trump surprised himself and the world by being elected president of the US in 2017 . He then surprised the world again by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2018 and by announcing plans to launch a trade war with China. In recent years, the United States has been seen as a friend, as an enemy or as both. This was the case with Russia and Russia's allies, and also with China and some of its partners. How Trump's presidency will affect those relationships and the broader world order is uncertain.

At the Republican Leadership Conference over the weekend , Herman Cain announced that he may run for president in 2016, and the response from the media and Republican party establishment was not what we have come to expect from Mitt Romney.

Full Circle shows artist Amy Lee Sanford in a circle of pots made from soil from her father ’ s garden, where she lives in a log cabin. Sanford and the pottery are connected because her father built the cabin for his wife. The pots she makes are sold to raise money to fund a new roof for a nearby school for disabled students, who are also her friends. “It is really hard to come up with money for things that are not tangible, but it is about giving and sharing,” says Sanford.

REMEMBER how crisp , sharp and dominating the Jets played in building a 21-0 lead in the first half against the Patriots on Nov. 21, 2015? How did they do that without their best pass rusher and best run stopper in Darrelle Revis or Sheldon Richardson ? In fact, they won’t be seeing them back in a game until next season at the earliest and that makes sense for both sides. The Jets have invested so much in free agency to try to get a better pass rush and a better run defense.

"Why is the gravitational field of the universe another name for space-time ? used by Riemann to describe the geometry of our universe. Let us say we start with flat Minkowski space as the spacetime background and put a particle in that space. Now we ask what is the spacetime background of that particle. Obviously it will be a curved Riemann space, and it will have a curvature radius which is the gravitational field of the particle. So we call the curved Riemann space inside a particle, the particle's ""field of gravitational field""."

President Obama is ratcheting up the pressure on Wall Street to back a financial regulatory overhaul winding its way through Congress. His administration and lawmakers of both parties agree that overhauling the financial regulatory system will be one of the biggest challenges of the new Congress, but they don't necessarily see eye-to-eye about how to fix it. While House and Senate leaders are preparing legislation that would regulate the financial markets and overhaul the system of federal oversight, President Obama called for congressional action to strengthen financial regulation in a speech Friday in Washington.

Found in St. Luke 's Gospel ( 2:29-32 ) , is the last in historical sequence of the three great temptations which have occupied the attention of commentators throughout the centuries. It is interesting to note that the Devil does not tempt Jesus any more as he did in the Garden of Eden, but tempts him as the Son of God. We should note the similarity of Jesus' temptations to that recorded in Moses. It is difficult to decide in this context whether we should look at this passage from the point of view of an individual, or of a community.

Guys ... I do n't know why this has never been discussed at length , but if you like `` The Hobbit `` movies ... I hope that you do n't just watch them but go see them at the movie theater. I know that it has been discussed here before, but this time I mean that seriously. I went back to see them a few years ago and it has been so long since I've seen them, that it was a completely different movie to me than when I first saw them at age 9. I think that Peter Jackson has done a pretty darn good job.
ARSENAL fans turned on each other in an intense debate about their loss to Liverpool . The Gunners were crushed in a 5-1 drubbing last weekend at Anfield, where Jurgen Klopp‘s side cruised to a 6-1 league victory in the north London derby.

"BRUSSELS -- General Stanley A. McChrystal , the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan is finding himself squeezed between a ticking clock in the campaign to capture or kill Osama bin Laden -- and a White House determined to get the job done by any means necessary -- The Washington Post reports.

By this time the main Australian contingent of Anzacs that had fought on the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey had returned to Egypt to recuperate, so Scobie was left with an Anzac force of just over 6000 men, who had fought and lived through the worst campaigns of the war.

There is a very big difference between trying to get enough evidence for a criminal charge , president or not, and a real impeachment inquiry. Why do the Republicans need the evidence?

That is, if they don’t have the evidence, they don’t have any other option than to say, “well it’s impeach for good reason’. So, there is no reason for them to put up a fight. It’s just a ploy.

"A former federal official who earlier this year instructed the Bureau of Prisons to identify inmates to be transferred to home confinement, or community confinement, said last week that he had given the agency guidance on making the determinations.

Scotland’s devolution bill currently in progress is the Scottish equivalent of London’s devolution bill, the London devolution bill (currently in progress), the Northern Ireland devolution bill, the Wales and the English bill. We know that the people of Scotland generally think Scotland should be independent, but are they prepared to follow through with a legal process to achieve this ? If they are, then the Scotland bill is the bill to follow.
Senate Bill 17 purports to address the affordability of prescription drugs but then does nothing to tackle that problem . It would instead make life even worse for the millions of Americans who live on Medicaid, Medicare and who are enrolled in other insurance programs like CHIP . It is time for Washington to start putting people ahead of the drug lobby and the special interests and start doing what is best for our people. We need to repeal this bill and instead put forward real solutions to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We need to lower prices, not push up prices.

EARLIER this week , a remarkable advice came from Washington telling the Syrian opposition battling the crumbling regime of Bashar al-Assad that the best way for it to get the US to support it in overthrowing his government is to overthrow the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood, the most important of the Syrian opposition groups. So far, this advice is having no effect, not least because of the fact that the Syrian rebellion has been almost entirely led by Sunni Islamist groups, with some Christian and even some Alawite rebels. But it is worth examining the rationale for this startling suggestion.
A woman who turned 100 has offered this advice to those looking for a long , happy life : knock on her door. That might sound like an easy solution to living a happy , healthy , long life , right?

When my father turned 100 , I wrote a blog about him and about life expectancy . I have been asked many times to write more on what I learned.
If you find out that your landlord is in trouble and the property you rent is in foreclosure , do you want to know what is going to happen to it after foreclosure sale?

When did a Premier League north-west derby become an endangered species ?

It is an important one in that both clubs have risen from the ashes of the city’s industrial past. Liverpool in the mid to late 1960s and City in the years since 1992 have been transformed by money.

It is hard to fathom that the Pakistani authorities and military have been so ineffective in fighting and preventing this attack. If there is one lesson we have learned from the terrorist attacks in Mumbai and London, it is to take immediate action to identify and stop terrorists and their accomplices and to provide security to places like schools and public transportation. The Pakistani military, the intelligence, and law enforcement agencies must accept full responsibility for not having taken adequate security precautions to prevent and respond to such attacks.

It’s like it doesn’t even exist in the way the dress is made. I think it’s a great addition to the fall collections that are coming up in New York.
Israel may have been the Start-Up Nation for a while now , but never was that title more deserved than in recent times. What has changed? Israel has long been considered as a major player in the field of high-tech and innovation , which was further boosted in recent times as a lot of global companies and startups are establishing themselves in the country. There are a host of reasons that can be attributed to the flourishing high-tech sector in Israel. One of the most important factors is its well-developed R&D environment, which is largely supported by the government’s research funding policies.

Jerry Brown is perhaps the most powerful leader in our country who actually understands what has happened to our schools. He can’t control the federal government (no one can), but he can make it impossible for states to deny federal funding for any program that provides public schools. He can make it easy for districts to accept federal dollars. The only reason he hasn’t taken full advantage of this power yet is that he has to wait until 2018 to run for governor, but once he becomes governor, it’s going to happen.
Artists impression of a pair of giant New Zealand moa being attacked by raptor . Importing Australian emus and cassowaries into North America to create moa and other emu and cassowary hybrids in an effort to bring more moa back into existence in order to increase their chances of survival and reproduction. Moas are extinct flightless birds from prehistoric New Zealand. New Zealand is also a large supplier of emus. They have been hybridized and imported into many parts of the world. They are now common in Australia and New Zealand, but they were common in North America until the early 1800's.
Why do powerful people—the kind with prestigious careers and long marriages and children and parents and homes and money in the bank—go to rehab? And why are they willing to spend the money? Is it to get better or to feel better? To learn something? To stop doing bad things or to stop doing bad things they've been doing for years? Is it so they can be more powerful and more successful than ever before? Or so they can have more fun and be more interesting than ever before? Or so they can avoid being caught?

In a trade that shakes up the Eastern Conference , the Cleveland Cavaliers dealt point guard Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Kevin Love and a first-round pick in 2017 (top-eight protected). Love was the No. 1 overall selection by the Cavaliers in the 2007 draft and played his entire eight-year career with them. Irving was acquired from the Boston Celtics in late June in exchange for a package headlined by the Brooklyn Nets' unprotected 2018 first-round draft pick and center Sergey Karasev. The Cavs now have two of the top three picks in the 2017 draft and have an excellent young core.
House Democrats on Friday introduced legislation in support of the 2015 Paris climate agreement after President Trump had announced a year ago that he would withdraw America from the deal. The House is slated to vote on Thursday on the climate agreement, but the Senate is expected to vote on its version in the coming weeks. The Senate measure, if passed, will also need a presidential signature to become law. The new Democratic bill is the first major piece of legislation introduced after Trump’s announcement to withdraw from the climate deal.
One might think that a company so deeply tied to global trade would suffer under a Donald Trump presidency , and one of the chief ways in which it is trying to keep up with an increasingly protectionist administration is by exporting its data-gathering tech to foreign markets. In particular, Uber has been looking for expansion beyond the United States to areas like China — a move that has helped it become the world leader in ride-hailing services — and the company says it is ready to be a more global leader of data collection as the world becomes more international.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — A Senate panel voted Thursday to put a veteran former lobbyist in charge of the government's contracting and procurement systems, despite concerns that she may be unsuited for the job and a warning from lawmakers that the move could cost taxpayers millions of dollars. Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa became the first one of his colleagues to be appointed to head a major government agency. Harkin was tapped Thursday to lead the Agriculture Department, one of a number of Cabinet positions still vacant more than nine months after President Barack Obama took office.

WILMINGTON—Bob Rusten will leave his post of 4½ years as town manager in five weeks to take up the mantle as the city’s first elected supervisor of a town that has grown in population from 2,000 to 10,000 over the same time frame. It’s an enviable title, Rusten says, and one for which he feels fortunate to have the chance to serve. “It’s something I’ve been wanting to do since I came to Wilmington,” he says. But in his new job, Rusten will be faced with the challenge of navigating some tricky financial waters.
Burnley firsts remain second in the Lancashire ( North ) table after recording their ninth successive triumph in a hard earned 3-0 success over Blackburn at Haig Avenue. Having been 2-2 at half- time the visitors turned the game in their favour after the break, firstly with a pair of headers and then with a goal that came via a deflection. The second of those headed finishes was an excellent effort from full- back Stephen Foster who rose highest of all the Claret and Blue attacking players to head in an unstoppable left footed drive from an acute angle.

PRESCOTT , Ariz. ( AP ) — Authorities say a decomposed body found in a Prescott home has been positively identified as the husband and father who had been reported missing earlier in the week, and they believe his wife may have helped dispose of his body. According to Prescott police, the decomposing body found Thursday in the home of the missing couple — identified by authorities only as Jerry and Janelle — had an identification bracelet on it.

Turns out the Uncanny Valley isn ’ t just limited to humans . It ’ s not just Carrie Fisher either. I ’ ve been watching a lot of sci-fi lately, trying to get into the groove of sci-fi again (which is tough when you were a sci-fi junkie when you were in your mid twenties, and you still are thirty plus years later), and I ’ ve been surprised at how many of the female characters I’ve encountered in TV shows, movies, or books have the Uncanny Valley.
Scientists are very interested in bacteria for a number of reasons . Among the most recent is that they can produce useful products. One such product is citric acid, which is used to produce a wide variety of products including foodstuffs, medicines, and cosmetics. Citrate lyase enzymes, which are responsible for generating citric acid in plants, bacteria, and fungi, have also generated a lot of interest for their potential use in industry. What Makes a Good Biocatalytic Reaction? In biotechnology, the process of biocatalysis is the process by which biocatalysts carry out specific chemical reactions of biological interest.

I write about my lost generation & liberty . Three years ago , I caught H1N1 , or swine flu. It had been a while since my immune system had been assaulted by a foreign agent & I suffered a very mild illness. Then in June 2011 , I was hit again.

At the end of 2011 I ended up back at the hospital.

The Labor Department counts workers who have n't sought a job in the last four weeks as `` discouraged . '' So far, there is little indication that discouraged workers are moving back into work, as they did during the recovery from the Great Recession. But economists caution against drawing too broad a conclusion from the numbers until the broader picture is known. The proportion of the unemployed who are discouraged has risen since the end of 2011. It has been rising at a faster rate in recent months but is still well below a peak in the middle of 2009, when the unemployment rate was double the current rate.
"U.S.|Did the Trump Administration Separate Immigrant Children From Parents and Lose Them ? President Trump over the weekend falsely blamed the Democrats for his policy. The policy, known as “family separations,” was implemented as part of the Trump Administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, which is the focus of a massive public outcry. On May 31st, a federal judge temporarily barred the Administration from removing children from families who came to this country illegally while their cases were being heard by the court. On June 20th, Attorney General Sessions announced that the Administration was no longer enforcing the previous zero tolerance policy."

Re : Trudeau Shuffles Cabinet With Focus On Liberals ’ Team For 2019. Who really cares about Trudeau ’ s government anymore? The Canadian media have been speculating for the last few days on whether the new cabinet of Justin Trudeau is in line with the Liberal strategy of 2019. For the first time since October 2015, there will be a majority government. For the Liberal Party and its leader Justin Trudeau, this is their big opportunity. In contrast, for the Conservatives, who only managed to form a government thanks to the collapse of the Bloc Québécois, it is a very sad day.

Nineteen years after the events of Unbreakable and not long after those of Split ; vigilante David Dunn , who calls himself the Guardian , continues to walk the streets of New York City. Unbreakable was one of a handful of comic series released in the mid-2000s with a story arc based on the comic book character The Punisher, and Split is a comic series based on the events that occurred during the original trilogy. With these two films as a point of reference, it may be surprising to learn that David Dunn is not the Punisher.
Hello everyone . I was on stimulants for about 3 solid years in total because I started having ADHD symptoms when I was in the 5th grade and did not understand the severity of my issues or that I needed help. I was not able to function in society without the help of those drugs. It was not until I was a teenager and began attending college that I finally received help for my ADHD. My story is not much different as I have not been on meds for nearly 8 years and I am a college student that is struggling with some pretty serious challenges.

In my opinion ( and I think most people would agree ) , the Japanese have mastered the art of building the ultimate in comfort and luxury into their cars. Most of us want to enjoy the ride as much as we can whether we're in traffic, on the highway or the track. But not all cars can handle the extra stress, and not all of us can afford them. Sure, we can all dream about having a Porsche or a Mclaren. But I don't have that kind of money to invest in my car or my passion.
For at least the first and second rounds of this Masters , the theme will be misery . Anyone around at the end of this one, or in the second one if that happens, will have to decide what they want to see on the final weekend. Do they want to know that Phil and Tiger Woods are fighting it out at the top of this one for that elusive 5th green jacket? Or do they want to know that the guy who won this thing last time is back? And do they want to see what they saw last week or do they want to see something a little different?
A group of six leading economists took to the pages of mass-market tabloid Bild on Friday to warn the government of the dire economic implications of allowing the AfD into the Bundestag. The economists said the AfD had “no economic credibility” because of its “nationalist” and “ultra-right” political views, as well as its “extremist” and “irresponsible” stance on fiscal matters. Speaking to the tabloid, they added that should the AfD take over as the new governing party in Germany, it would be a catastrophe for the country’s already precarious finances.
Residents of Balsall Common will have to deal with planes flying close to the village following a trial of new rules. The Civil Aviation Authority have agreed to allow flights in restricted airspace over the south Wales village as part of plans to improve air traffic over Cardiff airport.

"The Norwell High girls lacrosse team uses an unconventional approach in between the pipes . Junior Emily Kelly and freshman Nicole Gagnon serve as the team's two goalies while the rest of the defensive unit is handled by a mix of players from the offense and defense. The approach seems to have paid off, as the Rams are currently riding a school-record 11-game undefeated streak. With seven games left in their regular-season schedule, there's little doubt that the Rams will be making a postseason appearance. ""We're playing as a hybrid defense and offense,"" said Head Coach Sarah Burch."
If you had told Lynn Blake on Valentine ’ s Day 2007 that she would eventually start a nonprofit that would raise $20 million in less than a decade to support the arts and education, she would have thought you were mad.

She is now the founder of ArtPlaceAmerica, a nonprofit organization that encourages people from all walks of life to explore, experience and appreciate the world of art.
Regional turboprop specialist ATR has delivered its 900th aircraft - and expects to break the 1,000 barrier within two years. An ATR 42-500 with an EASA-FAR type certificate flew for the first time on 22 October and is now part of an initial flight-test program that will run through 2018.

With Chanukah in the past and Purim far off in the future , we now find ourselves in the month of Adar! In this month, Jews begin the celebration of a special mitzvah known as the “fasting of the new moon”. On this day, a man must not eat from dusk until dawn. Why? How does it differ from other mitzvot of kashrus (the laws of proper food handling and consumption)? Why does this commandment fall on the second day of Adar, and not, like many of the other commandments, on the first day?
How 's the weather in your neck of the woods ? Got a heater ? I have an electric one that makes a noise when it turns off, and I'm wondering if you have any suggestions. I've had it for about 2 months. The guy at Best Buy was pretty nice. Said it was from his house. It took about a week to get it and it didn't have a fan at all. But, it was in my carport so I didn't have to worry about noise. It was just what he could fit in the truck.
Pope Benedict XVI told priests who have abused children to submit to the `` demands of justice , '' according to a letter released on Monday. The letter, addressed to the head of all priests in Argentina, was issued by Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, as he's known to Catholics worldwide, the Vatican said. The letter was released after the first anniversary of his installation as Pope Benedict XVI, a day earlier. The letter does not indicate if the order is voluntary or mandatory. Argentinians have made it clear that Bergoglio, who has been archbishop of Buenos Aires, wants priests who have abused to be defrocked.

Organized disruptors – both students and non-students – who shut down a pro-Israel gathering at University of California Los Angeles on Friday night are in the midst of their most important battle yet. It’s a battle they must win in order to secure a platform to promote their agenda and spread their message that free speech is not allowed on college campuses – especially not speech supporting Israel. It’s not clear if the organizers of the UCLA March 4 event knew beforehand that their event was about to be cancelled by an unknown group of protesters.

I have been much more positive about the Japanese economy than most other analysts in recent months , largely because I have a positive view about Japan's ability to weather a downturn in China's economic growth. But as I write, the yen has fallen sharply against the dollar, so I think it is worthwhile to take another look at Japan's economic situation, and to think about how Japan will respond when the yen falls a lot lower. The chart below compares Japanese economic data with those in other developed nations over the past two years, and is a good guide to recent trends.

And I asked her if she wanted to go to the lake with me,`` says Adam, 24, who graduated in 2008. ``She asked me to be a little more serious, to take it a little more serious, and that was good for me to hear because I was feeling like my life was getting a little bit too serious for a little while.``

Republican Assembly Declan OSullivans no on the floor today was his first public statement of opposition to legislation that would mandate paid leave.

""If those price increases prove sustainable, they will probably help fuel another real estate boom in the next few years."

At first glance , Otto Bell ’ s The Eagle Huntress looks like one of those archetypal ethnographic documentaries with a beautiful young woman in a strange and far away land. But as the film unfolds, something is gradually revealed that makes it different from most other ethnographic works of fiction. It has a central character who is a girl. And it is the story of a search for love and empowerment in a culture that has been marginalised and subjugated, and which has not even been aware of the concept of love until the arrival of Westerners. But this is only the surface of a very complex story.

Vietnam 's current-account deficit , low reserve coverage of short-term external debt and imports and high inflation make it more vulnerable to an economic downturn than it might be otherwise. The central bank has not responded to this situation by loosening monetary policy. In fact, it has tightened policy further by raising interest rates. In my opinion, the current situation is more serious than it is generally recognized. If the country is hit by a serious shock, the result will be catastrophic. Vietnam 's current-account surplus is not a buffer, as many economists and analysts argue.

Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer said that Alan McGinnis will never be eligible for parole . The Pemberton man was sentenced to serve a life sentence in prison for killing his girlfriend in 2011, but Billhimer said a recent review by a state board shows he is not eligible. “I believe in my heart of hearts that we are making a better world for our children by keeping this man away from our communities,” said Billhimer.

Could drain tubes solve Compact conflict ? How do we get more water into the Republican River ? Could it mean more water for our city ? If the State of Kansas can build a pipeline from Oklahoma to our city, then surely the Federal Government could build a pipeline from some part of Lake Michigan to the Great Salt Plains, or somewhere near where it gets its water in Michigan. The Republican River has never been a big factor in our city, and it should not be, because the city has more water than it can even use.

Former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was sentenced Friday to six years and nine months in the killing of teen Laquan McDonald, making him the third Chicago officer in the past year to receive a sentence for shooting and killing a black man. The sentence was handed down at the same court Van Dyke once served as chief of police — and the same court where another officer last year was found guilty on similar charges after a jury found him not guilty. Here’s a breakdown of Van Dyke’s sentence and the officer who received the last sentence for killing a black man.
There is no stronger motivation to bury the hatchet than ratings and pending contract negotiations . High above Midtown Manhattan, there sits one of New York’s most famous landmarks: the United Nations Secretariat Building. Located at East 42nd St. and First Ave., this neo-Romanesque building was completed in 1952, and is one of the most architecturally significant buildings in Midtown. As is the case with almost all such high-profile landmarks, there is a rather interesting history surrounding the UN’s building. It wasn’t always such a place of high-minded diplomacy.
There are plenty of products out there that make it possible to create narrated walk-throughs of content , but most of them require an audio file that the narrator must create first , which is time-consuming and expensive to do. You can’t easily edit these files to customize the content that they describe without getting an audio file back that you can use for your narration. If you are an online seller who sells products with descriptions, you know that some of these can cost a lot of money to produce. So what if you could make your own narrated walk-throughs?

Girls Like Biology , Boys Like Physics ? We all have our stereotypes about which subjects appeal more to girls and boys. We also have our prejudices, but are these stereotypes accurate? I’m not going to lie—I’ve been guilty of thinking that girls are better in math than in biology, and I used to think that boys just don’t like reading. Well, here’s a new study that says I might just have been wrong. It’s a study of “gender stereotyping”, so it’s pretty interesting.

Did Donald Trump Release Donald Trump ’ s Tax Return ? For a moment , it seemed that Rachel Maddow was in trouble. In her opening monologue Friday night, the MSNBC host and left-wing activist claimed that the U . S . Federal Election Commission had rejected a complaint from “anonymous sources” alleging that Trump had not paid his full taxes during 2005. But the FEC’s decision had nothing to do with whether the presumptive Republican nominee is telling the truth. And the sources Maddow cited as the basis for her report had nothing to do with Trump’s 2005 tax returns, either.

President Jacob Zuma believes that the public protector ’ s report on state capture was a political tool meant to remove him as president from office.

It is one of the most politically motivated state capture dossiers and reports I have seen in my lifetime. It was meant to do one thing only – remove me as President from office.
The new head of the national children ’ s hospital board has said it would be “ bad business ” to scrap the current arrangements with private companies that provide the bulk of its services and has said the public should have the choice to decide whether to pay more for treatment or for the services provided.

It 's hard to underestimate the success and increasing power of Amazon . Their market cap hovers just under $400 billion and their global reach continues to expand. Amazon 's online store has been the single largest driver of sales growth for Amazon 's cloud division for the past couple of years, and while that trend is slowing, it remains a significant component of their strategy.

The Manatee is the only living species of cetacean that is neither fish nor amphibian . This means that it can survive in salt water but also in fresh . It has webbed limbs which enable it to maneuver easily through shallow water .

A CANCER expert has hit on a way to kill tumours in two hours — using light . The technique involves exposing the tumour to a pulse of low-level light, which is then switched off within two seconds. The process, carried out while the patient is under general anaesthetic, could become the “treatment of choice” in the future, scientists have found.

They don't need an expert to know that, I think. And if they know, how can they say that they are not sure about what it was ?

New research suggests mice with induced Alzheimer ’ s-like symptoms had improved cognitive function when given a synthetic estrogen-like hormone. But the same hormone given to mice who did not have the same brain conditions caused increased aggression. It is known that a deficiency of estrogen is linked to Alzheimer's disease. But it's also been shown that estrogen supplements may slow cognitive decline and have other positive effects on aging brains. So why, then, would a hormone that mimics estrogen increase aggressive behavior in mice that do not have an actual brain disease?

(He's also a musician.)

When he turned towards the speaker’s platform to see what the noise was, the crowd erupted in laughter. It was the first of many gaffes that would mark Mr Hague’s first appearance at a Conservative Party rally on a Sunday, one of only five he will hold in the next two months.
"Ely , in northeastern Minnesota , is the gateway to the sprawling Superior National Forest and its 1 million-acre Boundary Waters Canoe Area , where you may be lucky enough to spot one of the continent's rarest species of bear, a woodland caribou called the boreal forest version of the white-tailed deer.

He looked the part in his denim and lean muscles . Many fans feel the nickname was an unfortunate byproduct of a long-standing dispute over the song 'Tie Your Mother Down' by the band's frontman, Ian Malcolm. For many, it symbolises the darker, more violent side of Ozzy. For others, it reflects the true meaning of Ozzy - a man of contradictions who has never been able to fully commit to either the good or bad in his character. The nickname came about during a heated exchange with a fan on the internet while he was still in Black Sabbath.

"The images we have published out of Yemen may be as unsettling as anything we have used before . Here, for instance, are three photographs depicting what we think could be the bodies of four boys who may have died under torture at the hands of US-backed Yemeni counterterrorism forces. This is not confirmed, but the images bear an eerie resemblance to a series of similar photographs published in November, which may have been the work of US Special Forces:

We are still working on getting confirmation of this as we cannot confirm the sources for the photos we published in November."

On Thursday , LightSquared submitted final arguments for its $ 7 billion dollar proposal to launch an LTE network . In its arguments, LightSquared reiterated the need to build an entirely new mobile wireless network to provide 4G coverage in the US. In fact, LightSquared CEO Philip Falcone argued that there is a “need for a national, integrated 4G system that can provide nationwide coverage” to create a robust ecosystem for smartphones and tablets to be developed. However, what was most surprising about LightSquared’s final arguments was the amount of misinformation about the mobile wireless marketplace.
If this was supposed to be a measuring stick game for the Flyers , they came up a bit short of expectations. Flyers fans have high hopes for this season and last season. The last time I checked, fans don't expect to see a lot of goals and certainly don't think the team will be contenders like they were last season. This team is better and deeper than that, but they are not quite as good as that. That's just my opinion. Overall the Flyers had better possession numbers last season.
Want to end the war on whistleblowers ? Revise the Espionage Act . Over the past 100 years , the law on whistleblowers has gone from being virtually nonexistent to being used as a weapon against those who speak out against government corruption , abuse of power , or violation of US national security . In the name of national security , whistleblowers are routinely charged under the Espionage Act. This is the only federal law that criminalizes the disclosure of classified information to the public . And it is being used as a tool by the Obama administration to go after whistleblowers who expose government misdeeds and illegal activities .

FOXBOROUGH - They are Camelot 's football team , extending perfection ( 17-0 ) into the new year , one Super Bowl win away from what many thought might be a possible last hurrah in the NFL. It's hard to believe it was six months ago when these Patriots traveled to Miami on Jan. 1 and lost a heartbreaker , 38-35, in overtime on national television. It was after that game that Rob Gronkowski, the team's dominant tight end , was carted away on a stretcher in the fourth quarter, his right forearm shattered by Dolphins linebacker Cameron Wake.

RICH KARLGAARD : You should look at 4 areas . One is financial regulations , which still makes it hard to get a loan.

So , there's still a little bit of regulation. Next is taxes . It's easy to pay taxes , so there's no incentive to be careful. If there is some incentive , then there is no incentive.

But unlike other countries where the company offers a variety of different types of services, such as taxi hailing and private transport, in Taiwan the service is still called UberX – a name that might not sit well with the local government.

Property search reveals nothing about community expertise or stellar service . Mobile is now the preferred mode of interaction with the client, but it is no substitute. The value of a brand is based on the emotional attachment you develop with it. Consumers are not going to be able to differentiate between your mobile app and an app that's not available on their mobile. If you're going to have an app, you had better have an equally good app for desktop. If you don't, you're wasting your time. Mobile apps have been a major success for some companies and a total bust for many others.

The Korea Offshore and Shipbuilding Association has released numbers confirming the expectations of many analysts : the number of actively registered offshore vessel design and construction companies has more than doubled in the last year. This is just one indicator that the Korean offshore industry has come of age. However, there are a number of challenges for the Korean offshore industry to overcome. Firstly, many of the new projects, particularly those being designed by international and domestic shipyards, are being developed in a way that does not always reflect the capabilities of the domestic shipbuilding industry, or of the shipyards’ skills sets.

The original meaning of mashiach was a priestly title given to the High Priest who was to rule Israel. It was also a title used to refer to King David. However, the title has been used in many places, including to refer to the anticipated Jewish leader."
Study suggests complex behaviors were handed down for tens of thousands of years . Despite intense scientific inquiry , there's still a lot to learn about how the human brain works. Scientists have learned the brain is divided into various regions , including a large collection of areas that regulate emotions , thoughts and actions. But researchers have yet to discover exactly how all these regions interact with one another. A new study published in Current Biology on Tuesday suggests that complex behaviors may have evolved gradually through small, genetic changes that affected multiple brain regions at the same time.

An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco today to block a California law that would require presidential candidates to list every campaign contribution, no matter how small, on tax returns for the previous decade. The law passed the legislature with little fanfare last month.

Although Anna Paquin is returning for another go-round with the character she created in X-Men 3, it looks like her role in this sequel will be limited to a cameo .

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre. It is bizarre because it flies in the face of the most fundamental of American political values, particularly the core American belief that a President must have a clear mandate from the electorate before he or she starts acting as their agent and enforcers. If the President is not legally allowed to act without their say-so, how can the President act with impunity? No matter what, he has no legitimacy. And yet that is not what the Intelligence agencies want.

His question was typical of many on the subject, such as this one: If you support gun rights, oppose the death penalty , favor freedom of expression, etc. — do you still get labeled a “libertarian” ?

The traditionally conservative Michelin guide , celebrating its 100th year and a new , leaner look for its mascot , has decided the best way to celebrate the milestone would be to stop printing its Michelin guide entirely. The French guide, a staple for many drivers, restaurant goers and foodies, this year celebrates its 100th anniversary since the Michelin Guide became a guide to Paris in 1913. However the guide has now said it will only be publishing the annual guide in print form - and for the first time not online. The decision was made last week and was confirmed to The Australian by Michelin in France.

First , we looked at which major brands cost the most to maintain over the first 10 years of a typical owner's car, and we've done the same for every year since 2001. Now we're taking a look at each brand's total lifetime ownership costs, by adding up the per-year price for each year, then totalling it all up for a full lifespan. It's an imperfect analysis, but a good one, since it accounts for both the upfront price and the depreciation value of a car. So how does the total lifetime ownership cost stack up for different brands?

To involve private sector in healthcare , what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to create more and more public clinics, hospitals etc., that are owned by government and managed and run for the benefit of the general public.

The last few years have seen quite a bit of private sector involvement in healthcare in many countries. Have they been a disaster? As for the private sector not providing healthcare, I think it's pretty much a given that they do.

What exactly separates people from machines ? Two things , actually : creativity and empathy . No matter what gets produced today , someone will come along and make a thing that’s a cut above what’s out there. In that sense, if we are going to be a society of humans rather than a society of products and services , there’s a good case that we are failing to make that transition. I’ve seen a few comments floating around lately about how people would rather own things than lease them.

The life of the mind puzzles poets and neuroscientists who go about mapping it and labeling it , and , in a sense, it will always puzzle those who would define it. One of the problems that arises when we ask what the life of the mind is , is that we are asking a question at once too complex and too easy. We know in our minds that we have a certain range of abilities , a certain way of perceiving and understanding the world which we call the life of the mind , and we know that others do not have the same abilities or the same perceptions and understanding.

You can think of it as being similar to the kind of machinery a dentist might use to pull teeth.
A facility manager wears many hats . It isn ’ t uncommon for a facility manager to lead a meeting, attend a training session, answer a call at work, coordinate a project, visit a site for an inspection, or provide technical help to an individual.

Will Chelsea switch gears vs. Arsenal ? Judging by his body language , you would never think Chelsea is only one win behind the Gunners with six games to play . There were times last season when Chelsea looked as if they had no idea where they were. It did not feel like there was any structure to the way they went about things at all . They seemed to be going by feel rather than by design. So what has changed? And will it be enough to get them back on track? There were signs of promise early in the season and Chelsea were well up the pecking order by mid-season .
The first time I heard these verses was in a small storefront church in Kiev , Ukraine . I remember the church , and the pastor who led the meeting, because the congregation was made up of a handful of students who were there to learn about the Bible . These students, just like many of the students who attend my current church , come from a country that is mostly hostile to Jesus Christ. In my church , in fact , most of the members who are in their late 20s and 30s were raised without a Christian foundation.

ZAMBOANGA CITY—Terror is stalking residents of the island town of Pata in Sulu and it ’ s not coming from an Islamic extremist group like ISIS, Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, or the Taliban.
