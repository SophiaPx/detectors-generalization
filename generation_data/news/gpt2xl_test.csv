Inspector Marcelo Arigony told reporters at a news conference Tuesday that members of the band knowingly purchased flares meant for outdoor use because they cost a mere $1.25 a piece, compared with the $35 price tag for an indoor flare.

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but also for that reason, an extraordinary case study for evaluating the mandate that should determine the relationship between the National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation. Ideally speaking, the national security set up anchored on Intelligence, exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security –external or internal –with the aim of neutralising it in time. At the same time, however, it does this on the authority of the elected Political Executive that is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy.|1

Multi-rotor aircraft are typically more stable and easy to fly, but also much slower than wing drones that focus on forward acceleration. Conversely, winged drones can fly faster and further than their hovering counterparts, but are harder to pilot, since they can’t perform vertical takeoffs and landings.|1

It follows the recent case of a 15-month-old boy who had been travelling with his family from Australia to Britain when he was exposed to the illness, Health Minister Mark Fielding said.

Sometimes it has nothing to do with food, but instead is about something so silly that we don’t need to get into it.|0

Narendra Modi ’ s Election Challenge : Create Jobs. Lots of Them. The Indian government ’ s failure to create jobs even as it is growing, has become the defining challenge of its first year in power.

And to think: We haven’t even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers. Regrettably, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball.|1

And yet the issue of trash and waste in general is one that affects us all, touching on matters of public health, social cohesion and tourism, amongst others!|1

BASEL, Switzerland – Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG said Monday that it has had reports of 13 cases the H1N1 flu becoming resistant to Tamiflu, which it calls a very low percentage.

How the internet has caught up with the ways of the world. The early web: UNIX command was beautiful if you knew what to do. This month, the World Wide Web turned 20, and its birthday was celebrated the world over. It was a pleasant change since the medium, once a new frontier of hope, has been regarded with suspicion ever since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. We had spent years outraging over the possibility that our choice of washing machines and underwear was being conditioned by smart web advertising, and, in 2018, we learned that even voter choice was open to manipulation.|1

TRUSTEES of Settle's Victoria Hall were celebrating this week after hearing they would receive a grant of more than £4 million to turn the building into a world-renowned performing arts venue. This money will allow the Trust to invest in transforming the historic building which has been derelict for over 20 years and will help transform the area around it into a major concert venue.

A search for ‘toxic mold’ will result in hundreds of scary warnings and ‘studies,’ but few are based in science—and many are motivated by profit. Recently a patient of mine was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well documented, but he adamantly denied that anyone had warned him to avoid alcohol. An initial confession of “a few drinks” turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact.|1

When the theme of the convention seems to have been, “Drill, baby, drill,” which is an energy policy in exactly the same way that, “Tax, baby, tax” is a fiscal policy (i.e., it isn’t), slogans are obviously all that the party has left.

Brazil is currently implementing the Brasil Sem Miséria programme — a continuation of the successful Fome Zero— which aims to do just that, Marques Porto says. Initiated in 2003 by former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Fome Zero is credited with having taken 30 to 40 million Brazilians out of poverty. One of the core actions of the programme was providing poor children with free school lunches, which were purchased by the state from family farms. In this way, support to local small farmers was provided at the same time as offering quality nutrition to children from low-income families.|1

Syria: Why is Assad Advancing? In the Presidential elections held at the beginning of June, Assad was declared the winner with 88.7% of the vote.

A CANCER expert has hit on a way to kill tumours in two hours — using light. The technique involves a single jab with a chemical then a flash of ultraviolet. Cancer cells in lab mice were found to self-destruct, with up to 95 per cent dead in two hours.

Stark County’s unemployment rate in August fell to 6.8 percent, the lowest it’s been since September 2008. For the first time since 2008, Stark County’s jobless rate slipped below 7 percent, and a variety of factors likely contributed to the decline. A leading suspect is the influx of businesses coming to the area because of oil and natural gas drilling in the Utica shale. Oil exploration companies have moved in, followed by engineering and construction firms that provide different services. Manufacturing also has seen growth because of increased demand locally and nationwide for steel and drilling equipment.|1

Can you put a price on faith? That is the question churchgoers are asking as the tradition of tithing -- giving 10% of your income to the church -- is increasingly challenged. Opponents of tithing say it is a misreading of the Bible, a practice created by man, not God. They say they should be free to donate whatever amount they choose, and they are arguing with pastors, writing letters and quitting congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teaching and rejected what has been a favored form of fund raising for decades.|1

First, we looked at which major brands cost the most to maintain over the first 10 years of a car's life. We grouped all years of all models by brand to compute their average cost by brand. In order to estimate annual maintenance costs, we found the amount spent on every two oil changes (as oil changes are generally done every six months). German imports lead the list by a fair margin, which isn't too surprising. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners on at least $10,000 over ten years compared to a BMW.|1

By doing this, they can rotate through companies with different payment dates, and thereby achieve a high dividend payout. The problem is that shares generally trade lower after a dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend.|1

The data center market in Russia continues to grow. One needs to look only at the considerable increase in the number of server farms that are being built.

It has also become more popular for service providers to provide storage services to enterprises and businesses, so that they do not necessarily need to run their own servers. In other words, if one needs to handle large volumes of data, it is not a bad idea to use an on-premises solution.|0

Multiple bills at the New Jersey statehouse are of interest to truckers and others using roadways throughout the state. Repeat drunk driving offenders could soon face harsher penalties for their actions. New Jersey law now limits punishment for affected offenders to a traffic offense. Bail typically is set at $2,500. The traffic offense designation allows drivers charged with drunken driving to continue to drive while awaiting their court date. Awaiting consideration on the Assembly floor is a bill to end that practice. Instead, A3057 would boost punishment for a person convicted of driving under the influence two times or more within 60 days to a fourth-degree crime.|1

The appeal also argues that the Court made a legal error in concluding that the committee can form its own opinion about the lawfulness of consultants’ decisions to grant or to refuse approval for an abortion.|1

Want to end the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the act has metastasized into a tool for government secrecy.

Censorship did not end when the war did. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute.|1

An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco today to block a California law requiring police to collect a DNA sample from anyone arrested on suspicion of a felony. The law is part of a 2004 voter initiative that gradually expanded the categories of people in the criminal justice system from whom DNA is collected with cheek swabs. The four plaintiffs are challenging a provision that went into effect in 2009 and requires the DNA sampling from all felony arrestees, regardless of whether they are ever charged or convicted of a crime.|1

"Veteran congressman Jim Leach (R-IA) went down to defeat in the massacre of 2006.

Nevertheless, one can only be thrilled with his defeat. That it happened just goes to show how fundamentally rotten the whole GOP scene had become. Leach was, in many ways, a person possessed of genuinely decent instincts and some fundamentally sound ideas about how the United States should conduct itself in the world.

I have just been reminded of why I quit financial journalism after 11 years in the saddle, including a spell as a Wall Street correspondent. While the world of finance had its fascinations, I grew increasingly disillusioned by the dominant narrative that it was always about the money, rather than any other considerations such as values and social impacts. They never registered on the radar. That's not altogether surprising, given the testosterone-fuelled dealing rooms and the fact there is very little connection between the decisions of City executives and their impact on ordinary peoples' lives.|1
“Interaction of Color,” the landmark 1963 book by Josef Albers — the German-born artist and educator who taught at the Bauhaus, Black Mountain College and Yale University over the course of his storied career — isn’t just for aspiring artists. Its mesmerizing illustrations are a revelation for anyone interested in color theory and human perception. On Thursday, to mark the book’s 50th anniversary, Yale University Press, the publisher of the original edition, will offer a fresh way to engage with Albers’s lessons by releasing the “Interaction of Color” App for the iPad.|1
Less than two years ago, I was seated at a South Atlantic League baseball game (low A ball) between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers — Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were charting the game. As I discussed in this post, neither pitcher seemed destined to make the major leagues. Richards had been undrafted in 2015 coming out of a small college, and thus had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016 and he was pitching well for Greensboro.|1
Did Donald Trump Release Donald Trump’s Tax Return? For a moment, it seemed that Rachel Maddow was in possession of a genuine scoop. And then, all of a sudden, it didn’t….Thanks to MSNBC, the suggestion that Trump has “paid no taxes in 18 years” has now been definitively proven to be false. Moreover, Trump seems to have paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than did most political figures, and to have enjoyed a sizeable income to boot. Whether the report was cherry-picked we cannot possibly know.|1
Doug Newcomb 2015 Lincoln MKC If you want a sleek-looking, lower-priced luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual import suspects, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is a compelling option. Relatively affordable. Extensive driver-assist customizations. Quiet ride. Dated infotainment interface. Less lively engine than rivals. If you want a sleek-looking, lower-priced luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual import suspects, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is a compelling option. While Ford has been setting sales records and racking up profits, its luxury Lincoln division has largely been left in the dust by competitors.|1
When I went to meet Bono at the bar of his hotel, I saw Richard Gere seated at a table with a gorgeous woman in a little fur jacket and a leather cap. Bono, on the other hand, had removed himself to a quiet back room, where he was keeping company with a plump, middle-aged white guy in a suit and tie. (Bono was wearing a T-shirt and a fuzzy sweater whose sleeve needed mending.) This was Randall Tobias, head of the Bush administration's AIDS program. The administration had just announced that the program was providing antiretroviral drugs to 155,000 Africans with AIDS.|1
(Newser) – After a car fatally hit a 70-year-old pedestrian, the driver's insurance company sought payment to fix the vehicle—from the victim's daughter. Anna Cedeno, a recent cancer survivor, was walking to a bus stop when she was hit by a passing BMW, the New York Post reports. She died two hours later. Police didn't give the driver a citation, noting that Cedeno hadn't been crossing at a crosswalk or stoplight. It only runs counter to their position because they got called out on it. Well, you know...corporations are people, my friend.|1

NASA will plunge a small robot into a volcano in Hawaii in order to map data and geographical features of its insides, such as fissures and volcanic vents. A similar robot is already exploring the volcano. “We don't know exactly how volcanoes erupt. We have models but they are all very, very simplified. This project aims to help make those models more realistic,” Carolyn Parcheta, a postdoctoral fellow based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said, according to NASA. The robot, developed by NASA, can climb into areas that are inaccessible to humans.|1
England have called up Fulham's uncapped goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli for the games against Spain and Switzerland, while midfielder Adam Lallana has withdrawn. Bettinelli, 26, was not in Fulham's squad for the first two matches of the season but has regained his place. First-choice keeper Jordan Pickford did not take part in the squad's main training session on Tuesday. Lallana has returned to Liverpool to have a groin strain assessed.

From M1917 to M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps are on the cusp of a centennial—the 100th anniversary of the tank in U.S. service. This animated GIF, put together by the folks at partcatalog.com, shows the evolution of the American tank—from the clanky M1917 light tank to the M1A2 Abrams—and shows how the U.S. went from a newcomer to the world of tanks to world leader. The M1917 light tank, for example, was merely a copy of the Renault FT-17. That kind of copycat engineering is an idea that would be unthinkable now.|1
Patrick Warburton, the actor who portrayed David Puddy on `` Seinfeld, '' was in attendance at Wednesday night's show. But the comedian had other plans: he stopped by a table of fans after the show to sign autographs for $10 apiece. For those keeping count, it was the most expensive autograph session in town. The New England Patriots lost to the Houston Texans 34-23 Sunday afternoon. The game was tight until the final minutes when Tom Brady threw a touchdown to Julian Edelman in the closing moments. The Patriots offense did not produce many big plays as they struggled to move the ball offensively.|0

Relatives of the deceased bravely listened as the circumstances of the deaths were heard in detail. Harrowing details of how the Clutha helicopter victims died were read out at the Fatal Accident Inquiry today.

Central American referee Carlos Batres has fallen for the worst dive of the World Cup by the most theatrical Italian since Federico Fellini. By doing so, he cost New Zealand's All Whites a famous win over football's reigning world champions. The scenes were reminiscent of Australia's defeat to Italy in the 2006 World Cup. Then, the 10-man Italian team scored an injury-time penalty after Fabio Grosso tumbled over defender Lucas Neill. Fabio Grosso goes down after a challenge by Lucas Neill during the 2006 World Cup. Make no bones about it - Italy, winners of four World Cup crowns, cheated to get back into the game.|1
The drama started when Jenelle Evans and her mother Barbara were hanging out. While the two have had a history of marital issues, it was never really clear what caused the split. Rumors at the time also suggested that things between Jenelle and her father David Eason had gone sour as well. Things got worse when the Teen Mom 2 star posted a series of bizarre tweets about her relationship with Eason.

The lead seal is the first found bearing the image of St. Sabas, local big shot 1,500 years ago. A rare seal from the Crusader era has been found in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Kiryat Yovel. The lead seal, which dates to some 800 years ago, bears the likeness of St. Sabas, one of the most important people active in Jerusalem during the Byzantine period, some 1,500 years ago. Despite the importance of St. Sabas — whose Syriac name is Mar Saba — to Christian history in Israel, no seals with his image had been found before.|1
While giant and spectacular circus shows now roam the Earth, it ’ s good to be reminded how they were once a little different, and perhaps even more dangerous. The ancient Egyptians had their own version of the world-famous spectacle known as the Nile Boat Show, but for those living before the coming of the Romans and Greeks, there was nothing quite like the African pyramids. This week on Smithsonian.com, historian James Gilreath tells the story of one man’s remarkable journey from Africa to the Americas in search of the truth behind these towering structures that have captivated millions over the past two millennia.|0

The likeliest of sources stepped up for the Boston Red Sox on Sunday. David Ortiz, never one to shy away from the big moment, jacked a three-run homer off Joba Chamberlain in the ninth inning to give the Red Sox a 5-3 win over the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. The victory snapped Boston’s five-game losing streak and stopped the club’s streak of seven consecutive series ending in sweeps. Ortiz’s heroics obviously put the Red Sox over the top. But there was much more to Sunday’s win, so let’s go over some notes from the nationally televised affair.|1
The centerpiece of the rebuild is the warehouse, which was constructed in 1943, according to the date scrawled in concrete. It is made of wood. The roof leaks. There is no air conditioning, let alone a cold-storage unit for fresh fruits and vegetables. The warehouse should have been leveled years ago. But those at Poverello House trudged on, as they always have, doing a lot with very little. When it rains, it pours inside. The extreme temperatures spoil our food. And it presents serious pest-control problems.|1
VIDEO: On March 30, 2017, Atlanta drivers on I-85 north found themselves in a stunning situation when materials stored beneath the interstate overpass spanning Piedmont Road and Monroe Drive caught fire. The overpass then collapsed.

In fact, a whopping 58 percent of adults would pick the Internet over just about any other media outlet (including print media).

According to analysts, the market is entering a consolidation phase after the recent run-up. NEW DELHI: A below-normal monsoon forecast by private weather agency Skymet proved to be a big dampener for stock benchmarks on Wednesday, which surrendered the day's gains after scaling all-time highs. According to Skymet, monsoon in 2019 is likely to be ‘below normal’ to the tune of 93 per cent of the long period average (LPA) of 887 mm for four months starting from June to September. This sent the bulls hurtling downwards, wiping off the earlier gains, as the market ended in negative territory.|1

It was a situation which baffled many around the world, let alone the passengers on board the British Airways plane.

It is understood one possibility is that on its final flight on Sunday, the plane had flown to Edinburgh and back and so the same flight plan was repeated again on Monday morning.|1

The carrier operates 744 mainline planes that vary in size, carrying 50 to 366 passengers each. For a typical 737 plane carrying 179 passengers, the reduction would mean about 11 pounds per flight. Per the paper, stopping on-board sales of duty-free items like “perfumes, chocolates and liquor” also saved 1.4 millions of gallons of fuel annually, saving United Airlines $2.3 million. Presumably that also means United was making less than $2.3 million selling the items in-flight or calculated that allowing passengers to pick them up at ground level would not dent its revenue significantly.|1

The most common audit procedure related to accounts receivable is confirmation, in which the auditor will ask your customers to confirm their account balance. Knowing which assertions can be proved by confirmation can help you understand why your auditor asks for multiple audit procedures on the same account. Accounts receivable confirmations mainly serve to prove the existence assertion.|1
The Bible teaches, “Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are led by various lusts (see 1 Tim.3:5-6).

One person has said, “It takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it.” This is a true saying! I believe one of the most important reasons leaders fall is that most have never intentionally set up mental and emotional firewalls.|1

Part two of Naomi Klein's report on the events that triggered a momentous new kind of politics in Argentina. Up until quite recently, Argentina pursued a policy of official amnesia when it came to the crimes of the Dirty War.

But before the Argentinazo, most middle-class Argentinians regarded such actions as macabre rituals from a bygone era.|1

It was also a space for writers and intellectuals to meet. However, the Internet’s invasion and the poverty of Gaza Strip’s inhabitants have inhibited these activities. “Due to the rise of the Internet and the economic stagnation, we no longer got books for distribution or sale.|1

Edgar Wright has never made a bad movie. He’s never even made less than a very good movie, and so it makes sense that thus far in his career, Wright has shied away from straight-up sequels. However, that could possibly change with Baby Driver.

After a tense 24 hours, they have retreated to their safe houses following a massive security operation coordinated by the Met and other partners. But it is difficult to know what happened last night or even whether the disturbances were caused by one or two incidents, or a confluence of forces.|0

Is our efficient Tax Office killing this country? I’ve never seen a story where the Reserve Bank was urging the Government to give tax cuts. But that’s exactly what’s happening now, which partly explains why our economy is going off the boil.

Because of the productivity delivered via computer technology, the tax take for Government is surging.|1
In the third quarter of 2018, luxury home prices increased 3.2 % year over year to an average of $1,091,821 in New York City, the highest since Q3 2015 (see table below).

Year over year, luxury home prices increased 7.0%, the first year over year increase since Q2 2017. The Obama Administration is moving ahead with plans to spend billions of dollars a year to fight global warming even as many lawmakers on Capitol Hill are raising doubts about the plan.|0
Man robs jewellery on crutches! A man with a bandaged leg and using crutches fled a British hospital after allegedly steeling three gold rings from a jewellery shop there, police said. Police said the theft occurred Wednesday when the man asked to see the rings before grabbing them and running onto the grounds of Cardiff's University of Wales Hospital. The man described as heavyset and in his 30s or 40s took a nine carat white gold diamond ring, an 18 carat white gold ring and a 19 carat white gold ring with diamond studs.|1
The centerpiece of the rebuild is the warehouse, which was constructed in 1943, according to the date scrawled on a wall nearby. It's now home to about 25 people, including several retirees who work there full time. The building looks as if it could be torn down and replaced, with a new parking lot next to it. But there will probably be no development, because the owners aren't buying the property. They want to make sure the building stays as close to what it was as possible, said John McFarland, a partner at A.L. Miller Architects.|0

There has been a wealth of recent research that has demonstrated that dementia patients greatly benefit from participating in art therapy, but many researchers and practitioners remain underinformed about exactly how to make this happen effectively. It's not clear whether the brain region associated with creativity functions differently in dementia patients than healthy people do, for example. However, a study recently published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Research found that individuals who had received an arts education before developing dementia had much lower rates of cognitive decline and were able to keep up with both their own and other individuals' skills in verbal memory tasks.|0
WASHINGTON - RFK Stadium, the once and future home of major league baseball in the nation's capital, doesn't yet look like a field of dreams. It's configured for soccer, not baseball. The field must be replaced, and the dugouts, locker rooms and press box need upgrades. On a rainy day last week, a quarter of the field was mud and tire tracks. It looked like Vince Lombardi should be coaching football here - which he once did for the Washington Redskins. But that was in 1969.|1

Drones come in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes these days, but generally speaking, most of them operate by using lasers to'scan' their target. This scan is quite similar to the laser scanning used for point-and-shoots. But it's not just pointing your hand at an object, you have to point it straight at it. And then you need to be absolutely precise with your aiming. You don't want to shoot a moving target with a high-powered laser, which is why many drones use camera systems instead.|0
It looked like the scene after an earthquake. A sea of orange boxes littered the floors, shoes stuffed in every crevice, while confused people stood in shock. But this was no natural disaster. This was Black Friday at a Nike factory store in Seattle. Horrified shoppers at the Seattle Premium Outlets in Tulalip, Washington, shared pictures and video of the store's dismal condition after the holiday weekend. They show people carelessly crushing the boxes that protect Nike shoes while walking through the outlet, mindlessly grabbing and discarding sneakers as they go.|1

Jason Van Dyke, the former Chicago cop whose fatal 2014 shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald reignited the fervent nationwide conversation about police shootings, was sentenced Friday to six years and nine months in prison. The veteran police officer was convicted in October of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm for the shooting in October 2014. The shooting and video of it prompted protests throughout Chicago and calls for Van Dyke to face serious prison time.|1
"Volunteer divers have recovered the body of a teenager who went missing when he went swimming in the River Thames after police halted their underwater searches due to poor visibility. Ellis Downes jumped into the water to cool off with friends on Saturday evening, but got into difficulty as he tried to swim back to the riverbank and disappeared from view. The 16-year-old's family were highly critical of Thames Valley Police after the force said it was awaiting specialist teams to continue the underwater searches. Ellis' mother Emma thanked the volunteers, saying: ""If it wasn't for you our little boy would still be in that river now."""|1
"WASHINGTON -- An Iowa egg producer at the center of a nationwide outbreak of salmonella apologized to a Congressional panel Thursday for what the panel called ""gross mismanagement."" Republican Congressman Chris Collins asked Dr. Gary Stearns, Director of the Iowa Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), to come before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to explain why the agency failed to detect an outbreak that sickened over 50 people.

Ken Block makes amazing gymkhana videos. But NSW Police didn't want Ken Block to make this particular gymkhana video — the one you see right up there — in Sydney. So the Hoonigan team went to New York instead, leaving Australia in its dust. Here's the video they made — the video that could have featured the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and all our most famous city's iconic landmarks. Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was filmed to coincide with the launch of Forza Horizon 3, set in Australia — so it made sense for Gymkhana Nine to be filmed in Australia.|1

About 300 villagers from Kandal province locked in land disputes with private companies delivered petitions to embassies in Phnom Penh yesterday, before protesting in front of the provincial hall and calling for Prime Minister Hun Sen to help them. Villagers told the Post they wanted an end to land disputes caused by companies that had “seized their land”, adding that they would “rather die” than go home without a result. They said authorities had ignored their pleas for help while the companies had used the court system to have villagers who complained about the acquisitions arrested.|1

Young African-Americans embrace computers as integral to their futures, but they may be missing out on key opportunities to develop new skills and expand their knowledge. By 2030, nearly half of all African-American males between the age of 18 and 30 will be out of the workforce, a rate more than quadrupling since 1970. It would seem that no matter how smart you are, if someone has an opinion about you it's likely to be wrong. That's why many of our most successful scientists and inventors have chosen not to publish their work in professional journals.|0

Tech execs discuss the impact automation technologies are having on their organisations. For many organisations and their workers, the future looks very different to that of decades ago when robots ruled the high-tech, low-wage world.

A facility manager wears many hats. It isn ’ t uncommon for a facility manager to lead a meeting, design plans or oversee operations in one aspect of the facility but also to work closely with engineers, accountants and legal personnel to develop business plans for the rest of the facility’s operation as well as the day-to-day operations. What's in a name? At least one of those names—Swansea City—was never going to be on the list of finalists. So when the club unveiled its new crest earlier this summer, there was no reason to expect that Swansea would be among the first teams to adopt it.|0
Dundee has long been a city of rich character, great wealth and extreme poverty. If the new V&A can give it a transformational boost, it will be worth every penny. I declare an interest. I went to the embryonic Dundee University in the last year it was a college of St Andrews and, like many whose lives were touched by the city, I have retained a strong affection for place and people. Not everyone grew to love it. In these days, “clearing” sent hordes of last-minute placements to what they fondly anticipated as the cloistered life of Queen’s College, St Andrews.|1
It's safe to say Cleveland Browns cornerback and ASU alum Damarious Randall wasn't expecting a response like this when he asked the NFL to allow him to have his picture taken after being selected by the Browns as an undrafted free agent.

Why’s an incendiary Dutch journalist on the payroll of the ex-Alaska governor’s political action committee? A Mother Jones investigation. In recent months, Sarah Palin’s political action committee, SarahPAC, has paid thousands of dollars to a mysterious company that’s gone to significant lengths to mask its ownership. Addresses linked to the firm lead to mail drops. It has no website. No phone number. Not even the California lawyer who incorporated the company knew who was behind it. But a Mother Jones investigation has found that this firm is run by an unlikely foreign political operative.|1
Millennials are not a homogenous group of individuals, so a one-size-fits-all marcomms approach won't work. Millennials want healthy food and are willing to spend more on it. Oh wait, no – Millennials are in debt and want healthy food at affordable prices. They are also self-entitled. But they’re creative and tech-savvy, so that’s a good thing. And don’t try traditional advertising with them, stick to social media. If all of this sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a small glimpse of the countless contradicting reports on Millennials.|1

Manatees are large, gray aquatic mammals. They have fat bodies — I believe that “husky” is how clothing companies would attempt to get manatees to buy big jeans — that taper to a flat, paddle-shaped tail. Average adult manatees are about 10 feet long and weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds. Manatees are among God’s ugliest creatures in the ocean, and there are a lot of strange-looking seagoing creatures. Those are facts — well, the ugly observation is an opinion, but it’s obvious enough to be fact — that I learned from the Save the Manatee Club website.|1
OTTAWA, March 20 (Reuters) - In a fresh blow to the embattled government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a legislator quit his ruling Liberal Party to sit as an independent on Wednesday after defending a former minister at the center of a political scandal. Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to ensure construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial. The political crisis threatens the government's chances of re-election in a vote scheduled for October this year.|1
To a watching world, the sight of Britain on fire this week has surely been shocking. The looting and torching has revealed an inner-city London, Birmingham and Manchester seldom glimpsed in the England usually offered for export via soft-focus period dramas, Hugh Grant movies or stories on Will and Kate. If the revelation has puzzled outsiders, it has confused Britons no less. The mood here is a mixture of rage, fear and bafflement. Not that we’re not used to riots: We are.

The best element of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film, Split - and one of the few things it did right - happened at the very end. The brief, surprising reveal of Bruce Willis reprising his David Dunn character from Unbreakable created a shared universe that Shyamalan was all-too-eager to exploit. Unfortunately, there's a wide gulf between teasing fans with a momentary appearance and building a story around it. Glass, the third film in what has become a trilogy, comes across as a mix of half-formed ideas baked into an uneven casserole.|1
January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are making progress is because factions with responsibilities for large chunks of the population are willing to compromise if that will help stem the accelerating decline in living standards nationwide. Economic activity is shrinking and shortages increasing because of the factional fighting and especially because two governments claim to rule the entire country. Then there is all the Islamic terrorist violence. While most Libyans appreciate the help from Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Kaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become more of a menace than the Kaddafi era secret police ever were.|1

To laughter, Republican House members suggested LaHood was taking drugs, dismissed the very idea of bike lanes and derided any change to a car-dependent society. “What job is going to be created by having a bike lane?” asked Ohio Republican Steven LaTourette.

The Internet has changed beyond anything could have foreseen just five years ago. It is no longer a browsing medium: it is full of Web 2.0 applications, real time communications challenges and a whole range of threats that are designed to piggy back on this new usage.

This Webinar will explain how Internet usage has changed and how your perception of IT may not match what your users are actually doing, resulting in your security controls being by-passed.|1
Anyone who’s ever been frustrated at the task of shooting video in low light should be poised to freak out over Canon’s weird and amazing new camera.

When George Orwell wrote â€œ1984â€ he included a vision of the future in which people would converse in a language called. Orwell described Newspeak as “the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year”.

Is our efficient Tax Office killing this country? I ’ ve never seen a story where the Reserve Bank has not been helpful to its own policy-makers in times of crisis.
