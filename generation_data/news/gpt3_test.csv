"If this was supposed to be a measuring stick game for the Flyers , they came up a bit short  against their Metro Division rival as the Islanders notched a convincing win 

After two close matchups early in the season, the Islanders simply were too much for the Flyers as they outshot them 37-22 in a four goal defeat. Isles forwards Mathew Barzal and Brock Nelson both had multi-point games while netminder Semyon Varlamov earned the victory with a 27-save performance. The Flyers lacked their typical offensive spark which helped fuel their record-tying run earlier in the season, with forward James Van Riemsdyk coming away empty on his only three shots on net."|0

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but also for that reason, an extraordinary case study for evaluating the mandate that should determine the relationship between the National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation. Ideally speaking, the national security set up anchored on Intelligence, exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security –external or internal –with the aim of neutralising it in time. At the same time, however, it does this on the authority of the elected Political Executive that is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy.|1

I have just been reminded of why I quit financial journalism after 11 years in the saddle, including a spell as a Wall Street correspondent.

They never registered on the radar. That's not altogether surprising, given the testosterone-fuelled dealing rooms and the fact there is very little connection between the decisions of City executives and their impact on ordinary peoples' lives.|1

First, we looked at which major brands cost the most to maintain over the first 10 years of a car's life. We grouped all years of all models by brand to compute their average cost by brand. In order to estimate annual maintenance costs, we found the amount spent on every two oil changes (as oil changes are generally done every six months). German imports lead the list by a fair margin, which isn't too surprising. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners on at least $10,000 over ten years compared to a BMW.|1

"When George Orwell wrote â€œ1984â€ he included a vision of the future in which people would converse in a language  of control and one-way thinking. The concept of ""doublethink"" is at the heart of 1984 and this fear of rigid dogma was prevalent across his many works. As with so much of his work, the warning embedded in ""1984"" remains relevant today; humanity and freedom of thought should not be dictated by autocratic regimes, no matter their nationality. It is testament to Orwell's talent that this futuristic nightmare still inspires some fear among the citizens of democratic nations the world over."|0

Coach David Fizdale continues to manage the transition into the ""youth movement"", stocking the roster with lottery pick R.J. Barrett and German sharpshooter Dennis Smith Jr. While most believe the current iteration of Knicks is unlikely to challenge for a post-season spot in April, it provides fans a renewed sense of hope after the poor showing last season. Undeniably, their turnaround this season stems largely from their roster reorganization, with Julius Randle coming in and guiding a lot of the offensive action with several triple-doubles already."|0
Veteran congressman Jim Leach ( R-IA ) went down to defeat in the massacre of 2006 . I 'm no  political strategist, but I think that this is emblematic of the recent midterm election. The 2006 midterm elections resulted in dramatic change across the nation as control shifted from Republican to Democratic control of the Congress and state governments. While Democrats won in most parts of the country, what's noteworthy is that Jim Leach was an early pioneer in moderate Republicanism and was always an independent thinker who could reason outside his party's line.|0

Want to end the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the act has metastasized into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has done much to shape the freedom of political debate in the modern U.S. What began as a vague statute that gave President Woodrow Wilson power to jail critics and censor the news media during World War I has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by policing secrets, not speech. Censorship did not end when the war did. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute.|1

By detaining Haniyeh , Israel sent a message that Palestinian cash smuggling is coming to an end . It is  also viewed as an effort to help U.S efforts in tackling Iran's growing influence in the region .

Tensions have deepened between Palestinians, with Hamas activists asserting they would defy Israel at all costs while Israeli allies stressing Israel's right to halt contraband. Consequently, this provides Israeli authorities with sufficient ground to adopt harsher approaches against their critics and allies alike.|0

The likeliest of sources stepped up for the Boston Red Sox on Sunday. David Ortiz, never one to shy away from the big moment, jacked a three-run homer off Joba Chamberlain in the ninth inning to give the Red Sox a 5-3 win over the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. The victory snapped Boston’s five-game losing streak and stopped the club’s streak of seven consecutive series ending in sweeps. Ortiz’s heroics obviously put the Red Sox over the top. But there was much more to Sunday’s win, so let’s go over some notes from the nationally televised affair.|1

PREBLE COUNTY — With two serious crashes involving young people occurring in Preble County over the past week, Preble County Sheriff Mike Simpson discussed summer driving practices as younger, less experienced drivers become more active during the summer. According to Simpson, during the summer roadways often become more active and younger drivers tend to be on the road more because they are no longer in school. “With kids out of school or kids back from college, there a lot more of younger drivers on the roadways going back and forth from events or work now that they aren’t in schools for 6-7 hours a day,” Simpson said.|1

Stark County’s unemployment rate in August fell to 6.8 percent, the lowest it’s been since September 2008. For the first time since 2008, Stark County’s jobless rate slipped below 7 percent, and a variety of factors likely contributed to the decline. A leading suspect is the influx of businesses coming to the area because of oil and natural gas drilling in the Utica shale. Oil exploration companies have moved in, followed by engineering and construction firms that provide different services. Manufacturing also has seen growth because of increased demand locally and nationwide for steel and drilling equipment.|1

DARTMOUTH — On June 14, Flag Day, the students of the James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth gathered outside to celebrate Flag Day.

The students responded and made cards that were then sent to Iraq.|1

The Korea Offshore and Shipbuilding Association has released numbers confirming the expectations of many analysts : the number of actively  sailing ships in Korea fell by 17.4%. According to the association, this decline is mostly due to a global decline in new shipbuilding orders and a general softening in ship prices. Moreover, the implementation of various new environment policies and initiatives further restrained activity. Furthermore, orders fell as corporate bankruptcy reached record highs in South Korea. A reduction in bank lending to domestic shipping businesses has created additional strain, with a consequent cash crunch now being experienced in this industry.|0

"This clears the way for debt agencies to charge higher fees on overdue loans . According to a Tuesday analysis  by Moody's Investor Service, this development should ""substantially"" lower default costs, a credit positive for the entire market.

Along with providing additional liquidity and avoiding costly foreclosure proceedings, this provides assurance of tighter creditor and collection regulations, leading to better consumer protection from rising consumer debt."|0

The Bible teaches, “Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are led by various lusts (see 1 Tim.3:5-6). Many great people in God have fallen into fleshly temptations and potentially ruined their lives and ministries. One person has said, “It takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it.” This is a true saying! I believe one of the most important reasons leaders fall is that most have never intentionally set up mental and emotional firewalls.|1

Drones come in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes these days, but generally speaking, most of them still fall within one of two categories. There are those of the multi-rotor variety (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc), and those of the winged variety. Both categories have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor aircraft are typically more stable and easy to fly, but also much slower than wing drones that focus on forward acceleration. Conversely, winged drones can fly faster and further than their hovering counterparts, but are harder to pilot, since they can’t perform vertical takeoffs and landings.|1

With even modest moves to counter this climate crisis , its effects may be cushioned. Moreover, educating future generations to sustain the biosphere by prioritizing environmental goals could benefit us all.|0

Pollard believes the Texas social services system needs to implement better regulations that enforce fraud prevention more effectively than going through the court system.

Additionally, incentives should be developed that increase reports of fraudulent activity.|0

While many political leaders sought an explanation and demanded swift action, the light consequences left taxpayers questioning why no reprimand was given, further entrenching BP in the larger conversation about corporate abuse."|0

Manatees are large, gray aquatic mammals. They have fat bodies — I believe that “husky” is how clothing companies would attempt to get manatees to buy big jeans — that taper to a flat, paddle-shaped tail. Average adult manatees are about 10 feet long and weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds. Manatees are among God’s ugliest creatures in the ocean, and there are a lot of strange-looking seagoing creatures. Those are facts — well, the ugly observation is an opinion, but it’s obvious enough to be fact — that I learned from the Save the Manatee Club website.|1

The 52-year-old retired attorney stumbled across the issue last fall when she served as a Harris County grand jury forewoman.

Edgar Wright has never made a bad movie. He’s never even made less than a very good movie, and so it makes sense that thus far in his career, Wright has shied away from straight-up sequels. However, that could possibly change with Baby Driver.

The overstuffed roster for X-Men: Days of Future Past just got a little bit smaller.

Property search reveals nothing about community expertise or stellar service. Mobile is now the preferred mode of interaction with the online world, regardless of objective or content. Video simply isn't an option anymore. Use it for authentic presentation or risk being forgotten. I have a confession to make: I don’t attend Inman Connect to connect. At least, not in the sense that most people mean. As the marketing director for an industry vendor, my day-in, day-out job is to educate real estate agents. When I come to Inman Connect, however, I get to learn from agents.|1

Ken Block makes amazing gymkhana videos. But NSW Police didn't want Ken Block to make this particular gymkhana video — the one you see right up there — in Sydney. So the Hoonigan team went to New York instead, leaving Australia in its dust. Here's the video they made — the video that could have featured the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and all our most famous city's iconic landmarks. Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was filmed to coincide with the launch of Forza Horizon 3, set in Australia — so it made sense for Gymkhana Nine to be filmed in Australia.|1
Syria: Why is Assad Advancing? In the Presidential elections held at the beginning of June, Assad was declared the winner with 88.7% of the vote. That is not surprising considering the nature of the regime. However, in spite of the fact that these were in no way “free” elections, and that many people could not vote as they were in refugee camps beyond the borders of the country, what emerged was that a significant section of the population is backing Assad. Why is this? Stop criminal attack on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli army embarked on a ground offensive into Gaza.|1

My daughter, a resident advisor at her college, recently groaned while mentioning that she’d likely get additional foreign exchange students to supervise this fall. When I asked why that’s a bad thing, she said the foreign exchange kids tend to presume Americans are stupid unless proven otherwise. They assume Americans aren’t as well-traveled, or as fluent in foreign languages or as knowledgeable about world cultures. I said what any Good American would: Why don’t they stay home, then? Oh, she replied, they don’t think our colleges are stupid.|1

The part of the park that will open first is approximately 225 acres and it is comprised of interpretive and scenic trail portions of the southside loop trail.

BATON ROUGE , LA ( WAFB ) - Golfers in Baton Rouge could have fewer places to tee off after  the closure of Santa Maria Golf Course in March. The Santa Maria was an important source of revenue for Baton Rouge since its inception back in 1976. In fact, it produced around $170,000 annually, almost 80% of which went towards assisting recreational programs and summer camps for local youth. However, local sports facilities had not received any major capital improvements in recent times, and overuse has caused some golf holes to close.|0

"It is easy to lose democratic mechanisms but difficult to get them back , says the incoming General Secretary of  the United Nations,

Antonio Guterres. Democracy is in decline worldwide, warned the incoming leader. Citizens’ freedoms and civil rights, due to reduced funding and weaker legal systems, have increasingly come under threat from those in authority. As citizens lose the essential tools of dialogue, opinion and representation, these in turn fuel the mistrust and instability that deepen these problems further. Democracy is a precious and indispensable source of rights for people worldwide and these cannot be allowed to slip away, Guterres asserted."|0
A search for ‘toxic mold’ will result in hundreds of scary warnings and ‘studies,’ but few are based in science—and many are motivated by profit. Recently a patient of mine was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well documented, but he adamantly denied that anyone had warned him to avoid alcohol. An initial confession of “a few drinks” turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact.|1

interview, Allen, who's also a rapper, was quoted saying ""When I heard the lyrics in Bell's song, it resonated with me a lot. In our profession, nobody ever truly listens. There's just the chase to chase money or chase the ring and the hope that somehow the message that is told might somehow reflect those values.

About 300 villagers from Kandal province locked in land disputes with private companies delivered petitions to embassies in Phnom Penh yesterday, before protesting in front of the provincial hall and calling for Prime Minister Hun Sen to help them. Villagers told the Post they wanted an end to land disputes caused by companies that had “seized their land”, adding that they would “rather die” than go home without a result.

Manatees are large , gray aquatic mammals . They have fat bodies — I believe that “ husky ” is  the right word here ! — and two flippers with which they move slowly through the water. In some parts of the world they can even be found in warm rivers and streams. They are an endangered species due to accidental entanglements in fishing gear, getting hit by boats and other disturbances, such as the constant rise of water temperatures due to climate change. There is a sad stat though - an estimate shows that 3 out of 4 manatee calves die before reaching adulthood.|0

Montana, Exxon-Mobil At Odds Over Oil Spill Montana and oil giant Exxon-Mobil are at odds over an oil spill in the state's Yellowstone River. Exxon-Mobil says it's doing all it can to clean up the spill and has promised to see the cleanup through. That's not enough for Montana's state officials — particularly its governor.

Guess what? The NBA really is a showbiz affair. Only super-producer David Stern isn’t pulling all the behind-the-curtain strings (otherwise, New York somehow would have won the draft lottery). To the contrary, the league lurches along in the manner of an over-budget, out-of-control Hollywood spectacular — propelled by the ego of big-money players, rife with jaw-dropping plot twists, subject to endless rewrites. And to think: We haven’t even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers. Regrettably, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball.|1

By maintaining and renovating this corridor we are creating economic opportunities while at the same time showing our city that we still recognize its needs and wants. Having South Central Corridor means more money circulation in the local communities with more job opportunities for skilled labor.|0

I had recently left my job on Wall Street and was living in Kiev with my mother after my father had passed away and I was there because I was not having much luck in finding my way forward. I recall the wood-paneled walls of the room where I sat in the back, slightly embarrassed by the evangelical enthusiasm of my fellow expats. But when I heard these verses my wandering mind was drawn back.|1
"Could drain tubes solve Compact conflict ? How do we get more water into the Republican River ? Could it  happen this summer

With increasing worries about water and resource allocation in the Compact region, it's been a race to find new ways to handle the water shortage this summer. It is rumored that the Republican River could provide up to 4.5 billion cubic feet of additional water annually. And there are projects being researched to make this possible, including drainage tube structures. These underground drains will aid in releasing stored precipitation and giving increased water supplies that don't interfere with each state's stake in water rights."|0
If the U.S. presidential election were resolved on social media , Barack Obama would be the clear winner this year . The current president, Donald Trump, has been promoting his presidential bid on all social media platforms. On the other hand, Barack Obama has not expressed an interest in getting involved in this election directly and it doesn’t seem that his account have increased significantly over the last few months. Nevertheless, polls in the digital sphere continue to trend heavily in Obama’s favour. Analysts credit this advantage to the genuine affection expressed toward Obama by followers rather than Trump’s stiff digital strategy.|0
NEW DELHI : A day after declaring its candidate for the seventh Lok Sabha seat , the Aam Aadmi Party  (AAP) is preparing for a massive public campaign for the forthcoming general election.

Is our efficient Tax Office killing this country? I’ve never seen a story where the Reserve Bank was urging the Government to give tax cuts. But that’s exactly what’s happening now, which partly explains why our economy is going off the boil. In fact, the implication from this historically unusual tale is that the Tax Commissioner, Chris Jordan and his team have been doing such a great job cracking down on excessive deductions claims, especially from business. Because of the productivity delivered via computer technology, the tax take for Government is surging.|1

"""Fox & Friends"" convenes all-male panel to judge whether women are ""covering up their lady-parts""
On ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday morning, a panel of men was convened to determine the ""proper etiquette for wearing leggings,"" and they did so in the classiest way possible -- by parading young women in leggings before them so that they might critique their appearance. The panel was responding to a video that went viral yesterday in which a woman, as Steve Doocy kept repeating, claimed that leggings ""ain't pants."""|1
At her weekly therapy sessions, Julie revealed her most uncomfortable secrets: depression, debt, childhood sexual abuse. Her psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital would then type a summary into Julie’s computerized medical record. With that, more than 200 pages of sensitive notes became available to any doctor who cared for her within the sprawling Partners HealthCare system. She discovered this only when one doctor later referenced the notes. Julie, a 43-year-old lawyer, was unnerved, then angry. “The details are really nobody’s business,” she said. But Partners disagrees.|1
If the U.S. presidential election were resolved on social media, Barack Obama would be the clear winner this year over Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The Obama campaign has embraced social media, with the president holding a huge lead in Facebook and Twitter followers, and the affiliated Democratic National Committee is using private social networking tools to communicate with some campaign operatives. There's also evidence that the Obama campaign has tapped into social media analytics to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of the campaign's messages. Neither campaign, contacted to discuss their social media strategies, returned messages.|1
Less than two years ago, I was seated at a South Atlantic League baseball game (low A ball) between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers — Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were charting the game. As I discussed in this post, neither pitcher seemed destined to make the major leagues. Richards had been undrafted in 2015 coming out of a small college, and thus had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016 and he was pitching well for Greensboro.|1

ALBANY — Gov . Andrew Cuomo — who has two Twitter accounts with more than 863,000 followers — called the  progress made on racial justice reforms in New York the biggest leap the state had ever seen in its efforts to promote equitable and inclusive change. The governor declared that new laws include the creation of a civilian review board with the power to investigate police misconduct allegations and have the potential to mandate sweeping changes within law enforcement in New York. Furthermore, legislators struck a compromise to allow Attorney General Letitia James to appoint a special prosecutor in cases that involve killings of unarmed civilians.|0
"Arsene Wenger believes the return to fitness of England forward Theo Walcott and imminent recovery of Germany international Lukas Podolski  can save the day for Arsenal 

The arrivals of these two important attacking options into the team may lead to the best possible outcome - pushing Arsenal up the league. Their speed and creativity on the attack is invaluable, which means Wenger and his men can utilise other opportunities, thus enabling Arsenal to compete with rivals near the top of the standings. Despite a shaky start, Walcott and Podolski should certainly be significant additions in this second half of the campaign."|0
It was a situation which baffled many around the world, let alone the passengers on board the British Airways plane. Yesterday a British Airways passenger jet due to fly from London to Dusseldorf landed in Edinburgh by mistake after the incorrect flight plan was given to its pilots. The BA3271 flight was operated by German firm WDL Aviation - which was responsible for the aircraft and cabin crew - on behalf of BA as part of a leasing deal. It is understood one possibility is that on its final flight on Sunday, the plane had flown to Edinburgh and back and so the same flight plan was repeated again on Monday morning.|1
Really ? Was it this complex ? The Green Bay Press-Gazette reports that authorities say they are two to three  times more complicated. Detectives have also noticed that they're popping up faster than they used to, creating further challenges to keeping on top of potential clues. A former employee at one of the robberies recently caught by law enforcement offered to testify against the suspect and gave officials crucial details on the new robberies, including sophisticated tricks they used. With the increased security technology and networks becoming so intricate, it's become tougher to remain ahead of the burglars and law enforcement.|0

Part two of Naomi Klein's report on the events that triggered a momentous new kind of politics in Argentina. Up until quite recently, Argentina pursued a policy of official amnesia when it came to the crimes of the Dirty War. Sure, the human rights non-governmental organisations still issued numerous scathing reports, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo still marched and the children of disappeared parents still showed up, from time to time, outside the homes of ex-military figures to throw red paint. But before the Argentinazo, most middle-class Argentinians regarded such actions as macabre rituals from a bygone era.|1

He asserts that though people have talked a lot about 5G, it won’t happen overnight. Furthermore, VHA's progress in building the physical infrastructure will not immediately create changes that consumers can see."|0

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre  but disheartening. The recent intelligence fiasco, known as 'Russiagate' focused largely on the CIA, who regularly collects foreign intelligence relating to terrorist attacks. With his refusal to fully accept its conclusion that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee and interfere with the 2016 elections, Trump directly called out the 'political hacks' of the agency who supposedly provided such information. What may be thought to be even more troublesome than Trump disregarding CIA’s conclusions, is the criticism towards intelligence community that began during the Obama administration.|0

A CANCER expert has hit on a way to kill tumours in two hours — using light. The technique involves a single jab with a chemical then a flash of ultraviolet. Cancer cells in lab mice were found to self-destruct, with up to 95 per cent dead in two hours.

"November 17, 2015 12:55 a.m.
Michael Hoeppner had to shed his Manhattan street manners. We realized we were paying an arm and a leg in Manhattan. We looked all over. We got into this area, and the homes are stunning, and it just seemed nicer. The people who sold us this house live next door, Rodney and Desmond. They already had a couple of offers. I think partly what happened is that they wanted us as neighbors: a pregnant couple trying to get a first-time home buy. I’m sure probably that was more appealing than .1 percent more on the down payment or whatever."|1

"The foremost name among all such group is that of Bajrang Dal whose activist burnt alive , an Australian missionary  and his 2 year old Indian born son in 1999

The incident provoked criticism from a range of sources and is one of the first group against Christianity in the country to become widely publicised internationally. Following that Bajrang Dal had committed similar anti-Christian atrocities like assault of pastor, demolition of Christian places of worship and terrorization of the local pastors. Thus due to their involvement in forceful conversion activities, Bajrang Dal is largely recognized for their sheer hatred towards other religions and continues to inspire many similar vigilante religious factions in the country."|0

U.S. trade policy has become the top concern among chief financial officers , according to a CNBC quarterly survey . As protectionism rises and new taxes come into place, American businesses have become increasingly more vulnerable. With U.S. duties and foreign retaliations potentially having a detrimental impact on company profits, executives must remain vigilant about understanding the unpredictable policy and looking for ways to mitigate their business risks.

January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are making progress is because factions with responsibilities for large chunks of the population are willing to compromise if that will help stem the accelerating decline in living standards nationwide. Economic activity is shrinking and shortages increasing because of the factional fighting and especially because two governments claim to rule the entire country. Then there is all the Islamic terrorist violence. While most Libyans appreciate the help from Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Kaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become more of a menace than the Kaddafi era secret police ever were.|1

It concluded that stereotypes such as boys opting for physical science while girls prefer biological sciences do not apply broadly across sexes.|0

With the economy beginning to stall, Ben Bernanke's war on the nation's savers rolls on. A few of these funds even pay juicy double-digit yields — like the one my Permanent Wealth Investor subscribers have earned 20% on in two years. Dividend harvest funds: These funds buy shares in companies that are about to pay a dividend, and then sell the stock after the dividend is paid. By doing this, they can rotate through companies with different payment dates, and thereby achieve a high dividend payout. The problem is that shares generally trade lower after a dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend.|1

Multiple bills at the New Jersey statehouse are of interest to truckers and others using roadways throughout the state. Repeat drunk driving offenders could soon face harsher penalties for their actions. New Jersey law now limits punishment for affected offenders to a traffic offense. Bail typically is set at $2,500. The traffic offense designation allows drivers charged with drunken driving to continue to drive while awaiting their court date. Awaiting consideration on the Assembly floor is a bill to end that practice. Instead, A3057 would boost punishment for a person convicted of driving under the influence two times or more within 60 days to a fourth-degree crime.|1

Gaza is the world’s biggest prison. Nearly two million Palestinian people are locked up there by Israel’s military blockade.

Did Donald Trump Release Donald Trump’s Tax Return? For a moment, it seemed that Rachel Maddow was in possession of a genuine scoop. And then, all of a sudden, it didn’t….Thanks to MSNBC, the suggestion that Trump has “paid no taxes in 18 years” has now been definitively proven to be false. Moreover, Trump seems to have paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than did most political figures, and to have enjoyed a sizeable income to boot. Whether the report was cherry-picked we cannot possibly know.|1

Gaza is the world ’ s biggest prison . Nearly two million Palestinian people are locked up there by Israel ’s security forces. They face living conditions that even human rights organisations label as disastrous: electricity blackouts, scarce access to water and ever rising unemployment rate. The Israeli's indefinite occupation and oppression have lasted decades, even though no citizens should be deprived of their liberty because of the whereabouts they were born. To make things even worse, Israeli soldiers act with an unwarranted degree of aggression and a strong air of superiority which stifles every attempt by the civilians of Gaza to lead a dignified life.|0
New research suggests mice with induced Alzheimer ’ s-like symptoms had improved cognitive function when given a synthetic estrogen-like hormone . This finding suggests that estrogen plays an important role in protecting against neurodegenerative decline, and could indicate a possible approach to treat human patients suffering from dementia-related illnesses. Future research needs to evaluate further potential therapies and risk-to-benefit ratios that may enable us to protect, diagnose, and treat neurodegeneration in individuals living with the early stages of Alzheimer's. Currently, researchers are examining what effect increasing estrogen levels naturally would have on the pathology associated with Alzheimer's, as opposed to merely suppressing symptoms.|0
