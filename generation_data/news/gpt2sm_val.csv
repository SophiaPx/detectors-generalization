John Winter worries it could get worse, threatening $90-billion in planned projects, if the Northern Gateway oil pipeline isn’t built. “If this thing fails it will be a serious and significant issue,” Mr. Winter, president and CEO of the B.C. Chamber of Commerce, which represents 125 chambers around the province with 36,000 businesses in every sector of the economy, said in an interview.|1
"(CNN) -- Thousands of people in Northern Ireland protested Wednesday against the killing of two soldiers and a policeman, reportedly by paramilitaries who want the province to leave the United Kingdom and become part of the Republic of Ireland. Girls in Craigavon, where the police officer was killed, join a candlelit vigil. Unions organized a 30-minute silent vigil following the shooting of policeman Stephen Carroll on Monday and British soldiers Cengiz ""Pat"" Azimkar and Mark Quinsey on Saturday. Vigils were held in Belfast, Craigavon -- where Carroll died -- and other towns including Lisburn and Newry."|1

In the greatest debate since the color of the dress, people are arguing over what color these pills are and what they are meant to do. Now that the FDA has declared the opioid painkiller OxyContin a Schedule II drug for the treatment of conditions such as epilepsy, it should be easier for doctors and patients to prescribe the painkiller. For those in need, there are two medications that will reduce the painkiller's effects: Opioid Olanzapine® and Prunyantibine®. These products contain no psychoactive substances and have been recommended for long-term recovery from pain.|0
Kīlauea continues to erupt at its summit and East Rift Zone. During the past week, the summit lava has been flowing up a mountain off Mt. Soweto as lava flows from the south of Tanzania toward the West Rift Zone is being expelled from the area. While this lava flow may seem like a lot of lava (about 30 kilos in total) it is actually a very minor release of lava that contains much more mass than any lava in the entire region. However, the eruption could well have been caused by another event such as a meteor impact or volcanic ash cloud.|0
Considering all the comings and goings of people involved in the project, we should be grateful that Bohemian Rhapsody has finally landed on the big screen. Changing directors and lead actors puts a seed of doubt in minds as to how successful a film is likely to be. However, it’s a worthy biopic of Freddie Mercury, and Queen. There’s no argument that Rami Malek is great as the famed lead singer, but Ben Hardy (Roger Taylor), Gwilym Lee (Brian May) and Joseph Mazzello (John Deacon) also look and sound the part.|1
A group of Solomon Islands timber exporters and government officials is visiting Australia and New Zealand this week.

The group will meet with importers and government officials including a meeting with the New Zealand Timber Importers Association at the Pacific Islands Trade & Invest office in Newmarket. As 60% of sawn timber is sold to markets in Australia and New Zealand, the visits aim to increase understanding among both exporters and importers of market requirements and opportunities for Solomon Islands sawn timber.|1
Stephen Falk also noted that it's highly likely that there will be another `` Sunday Funday '' episode. It's unlikely the $5 billion in federal stimulus package this year would have been cut, he said, which would have helped spur economic growth and save the taxpayer money.

Plushenko’s glorious career was finished. He had hoped to cap it at home after a comeback from spinal surgery, which he did, partially, by helping Russia win the team competition. But his 31-year-old back, after all those years of wrenching revolutions and hard landings, gave out two nights too soon. In essence, Plushenko sacrificed his chance at another individual medal to put his country on top. He was a longshot for gold, but in a sport of sequins and stuffed animals, he brought pugnacious sizzle. He was the James Cagney of the ice.|1

"John Bennett(July 20), a teacher at Westside Middle School, was upset by the School Board's decision to have teachers teach all sides of any controversy. He is right, of course, that pretending all sides of any controversy are equally valid is nonsense. But a good deal of the issue hinges on our definition of ""teaching"" a position. If ""teaching"" means that the teacher merely presents all sides of a controversy as though they were equal in weight and legitimacy, then we are being equal time indoctrinists."|1
Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “Thank You” rally was the crowd’s silence when Trump mentioned that everyone should come together. The irony being that his campaign has been anything but unifying, which is why his supporters backed him.

I left Cincinnati tired and disheveled, but perhaps mostly worried about our future.|1

"So the latest Star Wars game has made tea-bagging Darth Vader ’ s smug Jedi son ’ s face an even bigger surprise than usual, and it comes in a way he hasn’t had before. In a series of tweets published on Monday evening, President Donald J. Trump said Friday that ""everyone needs to be able to choose between two choices’s side at some point.""

Women who work in the White House do earn equal pay. Another right-made-up fact. The Republicans with their tax cuts don't care about paid family leave, especially since they've already promised to cut some of the government spending. So why not turn it around? When I say that Donald Trump hasn't spoken up on immigration for more than two weeks, I mean quite a few things. He didn't say he wanted to renegotiate U.S. trade deals with China or Mexico, nor did he even suggest that we should be doing so.|0
Video — 1 videodisc ( 140 min. ) : sd., col. ; 4 3/4 in. A dramatisation of a dream, with sound effects. It's no accident that we don't quite know how to do our homework the way we're supposed to. We all know what we need to focus on right away, and there are so many factors to consider as well. When we look back at the past 12 months, one of them seems to be having an impact.

To most NBA experts, players and fans, Kobe Bryant is one of the top 20 best players of all time and one of the top five guards the league has ever produced. To some, he is second only to Michael Jordan and to a third, out there, group he is the best of all time. To get the first group of people to consider agreeing with the second (I leave out the third because nobody seriously believes that is ever possible), Kobe Bryant has to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a championship this season.|1

PARIS -- France could become the latest country to ban the use of underweight fashion models. France's health minister says she supports a proposal that would criminalize advertising that features anorexic models. The measure would put France, a world capital of fashion, in alignment with countries like Israel and Spain that are cracking down on the glorification of dangerously thin models. Socialist lawmaker Olivier Veran, who is also a doctor, wants to add language to an upcoming health bill to make it illegal to employ models deemed to have an eating disorder.|1

The Scimitar-horned Oryx no longer lives in the African desert. It is considered extinct in the wild. But this lovely-looking Ungulate hasn’t been completely wiped out because they can still be found at zoos around the world.

Add in birds, fish, reptiles and other living creatures, that number rises to nearly 1200. That’s why the work of organizations like the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute – or SCBI – is so crucial.|1

In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don’t report to presidents. In Russia, things are different. Most of those businesses are majority-state-owned corporations, virtual branches of the government. And that means when you talk to the head of a Russian bank or oil company, you are effectively talking to the Kremlin. In 2000, when Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency, he consolidated competing power centers — media, business, local government, opposition parties and the Parliament — under his authority. He called it “a vertical of power.” This system now includes organized crime and cybercriminals.|1

The NSA spied on Israel despite a US pledge to curtail surveillance of ally states, revealing how the Israelis lobbied US lawmakers to reject the Iranian nuclear deal. The snooping also reportedly eavesdropped on some members of Congress’ private talks. According to the Wall Street Journal, the spying has been ongoing during President Barack Obama’s two terms and continued unabated even after Edward Snowden’s surveillance revelations in 2013. Following the scandal, the Obama administration composed a so-called protected list, shielding close allies from surveillance, including countries such as Germany or France.|1

In Atlanta This Weekend? Then You Should Be At Momocon. Anime and gaming convention Momocon is on day three of it’s newly extended four-day run, which leaves plenty of time to check out some cosplay, buy some vintage video games and maybe watch a Kotaku writer judge an indie game contest. When I first attended Momocon back in 2010, it was an incredibly small convention held on the campus of Georgia Tech. Now it’s a massive event spanning multiple locations—the Omni Hotel, the Georgia World Congress Center, the Georgia World Congress Center’s tiny bathrooms—with more than 20,00o people expected to attend.|1
Other events add to the excitement. They, too, are a lot of work. But they add up to a great feeling of celebration that gives us a moment to reflect on the things we love about our country. The huge water balloon fight that one Richland neighborhood organizes is a fun reminder that we are all in this together. We suspect that a great many of us don't know our neighbors well. People are more likely to have friends on Facebook who may live on the other side of the country than friends on their street.|1

One wonders which of the two best reflects the reality in Sussiya. Yossi Melman wants to know how to play him; he didn't make the playoffs last year, but that doesn't mean he can't try and improve on those skills. I'm so glad my boyfriend was okay this morning.

My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors. In addition to this, we need to use techniques such as DNA editing and genetic profiling to identify which genes are involved in the development of these behaviors. Researchers have discovered the secret pathogen responsible for over 70 percent of autism spectrum disorders — including more than 80 percent of brain cancers — but only one in 10 will be linked to any specific disease or illness. One of the leading candidates is the Aetna virus, a human immune system that plays a crucial role in regulating food metabolism.|0

"When I opened the brown clasp envelope and pulled out the 21-page spiral book, I was startled. Dr. Zephyrhills gave me some sort of explanation that I couldn't give at this point: ""You'll have to see how much longer it takes to get it."" But when I looked for another answer, there came only a single one. There's an older man on duty, who didn't even want to talk.

The Giants have several holes to fill heading into the 2019 season, and own the No. 6 overall pick in this draft. If you were hoping for something that would be an injury free season, they're looking forward to some improvement on their roster.

Boulder has sued the fossil fuel companies. Probably 15 percent or so of us would be alive today without fossil fuels since without them we would be living in the Middle Ages without medicines, electricity, real sanitation, etc. Those of us who did not die in childbirth or by an infection caused by a scratch could enjoy living a short life behind an animal pulling a wooden plow. Maybe it would be best if we recognize that fossil fuels had their role, evolve our power supplies to renewable, storable resources, and stop demonizing everyone.|1

Running errands on your bicycle is a great way to burn calories and get some exercise. When you need something small or you are just checking prices and availability, pedaling to the store can be a pleasant experience if you can find a bicycle-friendly route. Several major shopping locations in the Rogue Valley can be accessed by bicycles without encountering excessive traffic. For example, both the Rogue Valley Mall and the Medford Shopping Center are easily accessible from the Bear Creek Greenway bicycle path. It is somewhat more difficult to ride a bike to the big-box stores along Highway 62 (Crater Lake Highway).|1

Although state trademark registration offers fewer benefits than trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, state trademark registration can be a cheap alternative for securing limited trademark rights. Federal trademark registration can run anywhere from several hundred dollars to $3,000, depending on the type of mark being registered and the amount of attorney's fees. On the other hand, many states charge less than $100 to file a trademark application. Keep in mind that state registration will not offer multi-state protection, nationwide priority status, incontestability, a presumption of validity or the ability to file a trademark on an intent to use basis.|1

The prosecutor said Trevino's body was found about three weeks later along with two other children, aged 12 years old and 11 years old. They both died the next day. The verdict has been appealed by a judge who also ruled Trevino should get a life sentence. In December 2010, after the trial ended, jurors returned a 5-3 decision to acquit Trevino, saying he did not make good on what they already knew.|0
The “digital workforce” may sound like science fiction, conjuring up images of lines of robots running through an office. In truth, the digital workforce is a tangible reality.

This hybrid workforce is coming to life thanks to businesses that recognize the transformative potential in automation and AI. In a study by Genpact of 300 C-suite and senior executives, 79% of AI leaders – the companies generating impact from AI – expect their employees to be comfortable working alongside robots by 2020.|1

Sunkett said the running back positions are still up from grabs and that the ground attack will be by committee, at least early in season. A young East St. Louis defensive unit gave up a lot of points a year ago.

That list includes Houston’s Clint Capela, one of the premier centres in the league who surely will stick in Texas, Chicago’s Zach LaVine, who was one of the key pieces in last years Jimmy Butler trade, Boston guard Marcus Smart, Portland centre Jusuf Nurkic and former No.|1
"The storm we're bracing for is the type of January variety everyone prepares for: monitor school closings, check flashlights and stock up on bread, eggs and milk. It's hard to know exactly how any storm will hit until it actually arrives. But there's a foreboding sense about what to expect in the coming days. ""We had something comparable in January 2014,"" said Aaron Reynolds, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Buffalo. That storm launched Buffalo's first official blizzard in 21 years at the time."|1

Who is K P Sharma Oli? The new prime minister of Nepal, K P Sharma Oli gained popularity in the 1990s for his efforts in the democratic movement that brought down the Panchayat regime. In the next few years, he became a key figure in Nepali politics.

"We chose to question the narrative of history by simply quoting words which Churchill used himself. At a glance, it might be difficult not to suspect that he thought these words were meant to demonstrate just why Britain was fighting for independence. In fact, some of them would have been in reference to the British defeat at the Battle of Waterloo. Indeed, many historians now argue that Churchill and other members of his political team believed those words when they were used against them in 1944. (The phrase ""war has never come"" was first used by George Orwell in 1945.)"|0
Jordin Sparks lit up the 2014 Billboard Music Awards red carpet! The tall 'Tattoo' singer flaunted her legs in a tight little black dress. The halter neckline showed off her sculpted shoulders, while the sequins on the garment added a touch of sparkle. Jordin added a pop of color to the outfit with a bright orange clutch.

The new law finishes old business in Trenton and expands the so-called Tuition Equality Act, which let qualified immigrants pay in-state tuition. Going to college is not cheap these days. In fact, for many in New Jersey, it is unaffordable. Gov.

A person with bipolar disorder may experience extreme changes in mood.|1
For decades, aid groups have assumed they know what's best for refugees and the poor; a growing body of evidence suggests they're wrong. Both academic research and practical experience, such as with the mass of Syrians fleeing civil war, shows that simply handing out traditional relief goods may not be the most effective way of helping the dispossessed. Aid agencies are tentatively also giving away cash and letting refugees decide for themselves what they need. While the results may be unexpected, the money is being wisely spent and rarely wasted - contrary to old prejudices among donors.|1

The decision on 15 December 2005 in the case of Jones v Garnett was a victory for the taxpayer and a vindication of the state's reputation as an efficient business. It marked the second time since World War Two that one of the most powerful governments in modern history had failed to provide enough services to its citizens, which caused concern about what kind of social and economic reforms were being pursued. In this article, we argue that the law is not necessary because it did not have the potential to protect the public from unfair discrimination based on race or ethnicity.|0
"(CNN) — Portuguese sailors called it the ""Gates of Hell."" Namibia's Bushmen speak of the land God made in anger. From the air, the bleak shoreline of the Skeleton Coast looks wonderful -- a deep green sea, fringed with surf, breaks over a shore receding into infinite dunes. From land, it's a different story. The Benguela Current rushes in, urgent and strong, hurtling the chilling Atlantic into the fierce heat of the Namib. Whale and seal skeletons from the former whaling industry still litter the coastline -- the source of the region's frightening name."|1

Steve Norris is former Conservative transport minister. Britain can reasonably claim to have invented the railway. Stephenson’s Rocket represented the pinnacle of British industrial-era innovation. The ability to move products and people by steam locomotion had a transformative effect on society. British ingenuity saw railways knit communities together across the country, and eventually the globe. And for the next couple of centuries, little changed. The same techniques are being used to maintain track now that were used in Stephenson’s time."|1

Akshara Haasan had what you would call a dream debut in Bollywood with ‘ Shamitabh ’. While the 2015 version of the song made her way around the country, she didn't land an international audience.

I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad’s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should not constantly be called to account for the vicious behaviour of IS. Still less to be stigmatised until unnamed Muslim leaders disowned it. I was disconcerted to see so many Eureka Street readers appeared to agree with the demands against which she protested. Both Ruby’s complaint and the responses to it reminded me of the attitudes taken to Catholics in an earlier generation. The popular charges against Catholics were honed in the Great War and particularly by the referenda on Conscription.|1

Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the stories of thousands of black Americans who fought for the rights of their communities. At the forefront of the effort is a legacy of civil rights-based organizations like the National Alliance to End Racial Discrimination, which has developed a model law to protect people of color at the state and local levels. They've been working on such legislation since 1993, but many still haven't gotten around to it. In 2010, Congress passed the Civil Rights Bill of Rights, which was signed into law by former President George W. Bush.|0

The University of Arkansas at Fort Smith recently told student Jennifer Braly that she was prohibited from giving lectures about being transgender to classes on campus, despite the fact that faculty were eager to feature her presentations.

Trans students will now be able to use the bathroom corresponding to the gender with which they identify.|1

The first image of Earth from lunar orbit. Before an Apollo-era NASA could launch a few humans on top of it, they needed a solid rocket. But once a solid rocket got operational and space shuttles had arrived at the orbiting outpost in 2003, it wasn't until 2015 that the American space agency was finally getting its hands on one. And so NASA has decided to go ahead and acquire the Curiosity rover. This article was originally published April 6, 2017 and has been updated as of June 20th, 2018.

"The proposal that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to stem migration is nothing but 'hipster' colonialism. Last week, Germany's Africa Commissioner Gunter Nooke said that European countries should be allowed to lease land and to build and run cities in Africa as a means of stemming what he views as the unchecked expansion of migration from Africa to Europe. For Nooke, allowing the ""free development"" of these areas would stimulate African economies and create ""growth and prosperity"" and therefore, reduce the attractiveness of Europe as a destination for migration. The proposal has elicited mixed reactions."|1

It's hard to imagine that 2001: A Space Odyssey would have its incredible cinematic impact without that classical soundtrack. But director Stanley Kubrick originally hired a composer to score the film, only to abandon the score in postproduction. Kubrick tapped Alex North, who had scored a number of classic films, including Kubrick's own Spartacus, to write the 2001 score. Kubrick deemed the score inadequate for the film, and replaced it with the classical musical tracks that are so familiar today. North wasn't aware of the change until the film premiered.|1

A pair of districts in the Midwest will add Muslim women to the ranks of the US Congress for the first time, CNN has projected.

Omar, in addition to being one of the first Muslim women in Congress, will also be the first Somali-American member. She came to the US more than two decades ago as a refugee.

Ryanair has lowered its full year profit guidance from a current range of €1.25-€1.35 billion to a new range of €1.10-€1.20 billion. The decision, which saw shares in the airline fall by more than ten per cent, comes after a turbulent period for the low-cost carrier. The Irish airline was recently hit by a fall in traffic after pilots and cabin crew in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Portugal went on strike. Ryanair has also been forced to lower fares for the third quarter of the year (particularly for the October school half-term holidays and Christmas) as customer confidence has been affected by fear of further strikes.|1

AMD's Ryzen CPUs offer some of the best bang for the buck, but which is best? AMD knocked it out of the park with the first and second generations of its Ryzen CPUs built upon the Zen and Zen+ architecture. It certainly helped wash away the taste of its less-than-stellar Bulldozer chips that launched in 2011. Ryzen provides far better per-core performance, power efficiency, and support for more modern technology. But that makes it harder than ever to decide which one to buy. The Ryzen family is broken into four distinct branches, targeting the entry-level, mainstream, performance, and high-end enthusiast sectors of the market.|1

Thirty years later, Mission of Burma still sounds like the future.

The Boston trio of Roger Miller, Clint Conley, and Peter Prescott brought exuberance and lyricism to their noise rock, producing only one full-length studio album before disbanding in 1983. Producer Martin Swope added the tape effects that lend the band its dreamlike, blurred-around-the-edges sound."|1

The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep. That is the provocative implication of recent research that examined investors’ financial risk-taking following periods when their sleep was disrupted. I concede that advice to get more sleep is hardly new, since we’ve been hearing that most of our lives — and the advice is honored more in the breach than in the observance. Furthermore, retirees typically would like to sleep more, but can’t — due to the disruptions in sleep patterns that are a normal part of the aging process.|1

CINCINNATI -- As FC Cincinnati fans chanted and cheered for taxpayers to help fund a Major League Soccer stadium, it seems like every day there is a new event. At first, this wasn't an obvious thing to do. It's common knowledge among football fans that the league does not pay for stadiums.

Sunni Fighters Returning To Al-Qaida In Iraq, 'NYT'Reports : The Two-Way After months of being squeezed out of the US military air force, some in Baghdad are now starting to see their hopes for returning to their home countries as an effective weapon against the terror group.

There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams's performances that could, roughly, be called his American and British side. On one hand, Williams wanted to do more than look the part: he wanted to stand out from the box office crowd. But on the other hand, Williams believed there was something different going for him. (He didn't like the idea of being labeled a wiz.) And so when it came time to make his debut at the age of 15, Williams seemed to fit the bill. But what really made him unique was his style.|0
It was a bountiful year for books in English by Quebec writers. Ian McGillis looks back at some of his favourites. Putting together a Lucky 13 piece on 2016’s best books in English by Quebec writers, the thought recurs that there were years, not so long ago, when getting a list up to this count could be a challenge.

That compares to around five minutes per viewing average for a 25–35 year-olds demographic. It's also true that women make up about 70% of U.S. cinemapers.

Keep it classy. Cheer. Revel in a rival. And Yankees - keep it brief, a simple ceremony of appreciation. Sure, there will be temptation for fans to boo one of the faces of the Red Sox's championship seasons in 2004, 2007 and 2013. Big Papi has tormented the Yankees over the years, pounding 52 homers against them (51 as a member of the Sox), and taking forever to round the bases after each one.

Will an upcoming vote in Congress signal the end of Medicare? In the next few weeks Congress will decide whether we want our public-health programs to be privatized, shuttered, reduced or defunded. How many more millions of Americans will die after a government program that protects health insurance from privatization is terminated?

But if the federal government gives up its responsibility to provide basic care, how will we get the money for it?|0

When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher, only the deepest, most corrosive cynicism is possible. Trampling on the rights of others for political advantage was the modus operandi of Adelaide's Nomenclature Committee in 1837. Western Buddhism and Pentecostalism are sometimes criticised as self-indulgent forms of religion. Is Bishop Spong's Christian humanism any different? The press coverage of Iraq’s surprise victory in the Asian Cup final was — as Ernst Bloch might have put it — full of utopian sentiment. The win was, admittedly, a remarkable achievement, but one that hardly accounted for the sheer exuberance of the outpoured emotion that followed.|1

Other events add to the excitement. They, too, are a lot of work. But they add another reason why you want to see them. To understand why we should pay attention to these events, let's consider something we already know is going on in South Sudan. That has been described as a'sanctuary' at least 20 years ago. It was not until 2013 that the US and international agencies were able to establish this sanctuary in order to ensure its protection. There is no legal status of the sanctuary at present, and the government cannot repatriate citizens who have failed to comply with U.S. requirements.|0
Although there ’ s long been a debate over the accuracy of health information online, many U.S. Internet users ’tend to doubt whether it is reliable. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has conducted surveys on more than 1,600 health-related topics—and its findings are almost always disputed by those with medical backgrounds. In one study published in February 2011, the American Journal of Preventive Medicine determined that approximately half of Americans don’t believe that online health services provide enough care for all patients. But even though most internet users can be easily reached through mobile devices, experts still face challenges when communicating with them about personal data.|0

In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don ’ t report to shareholders. And as such, they're largely unregulated under the law, a source of cheap speculation in their markets.

The Department of Justice is also reviewing a measure that would have legalized same-sex marriage in Washington State.

DALLAS (WSAZ) - Dallas Mavericks guard Goran Dragic said Saturday he plans to start training camp with the Milwaukee Bucks next month and could play in the NBA Finals this summer.|0
"Born in the country and fluent in the language, Gursewak Singh considers himself Japanese. The government doesn't seem to get it either. It is an issue, though. ""I think everyone should have a basic knowledge of the law,"" he says. His mother, however, insists that her son will not be discriminated against on the basis of his national origin. ""The main difference between me and her daughter is that my daughter is not Japanese. So why should we discriminate? That's what really matters here,"" she says."|0
"Evo Morales, Bolivia's president-elect, fresh from meetings with the leaders of Cuba and Venezuela, says that he wants to ""strengthen our relationship with the U.S. in an effective way."" This comes after a tense week ahead of the Nov. 12 elections in Honduras, where the Democratic National Party has been demanding the resignation of its leader, Jose Mujica, who has been fighting for years to stay on as president. Some observers question whether the new administration will push through further concessions or simply focus more on national security and trade."|0

To most NBA experts, players and fans, Kobe Bryant is one of the top 20 best players of all time. Yet it's not a stretch to wonder why Bryant wasn't selected by the Lakers during the 2005 NBA Draft. What are the reasons? Why, for one thing, does the Lakers never draft him before his third year in the NBA? Because they just couldn't do it with Bryant at the center of their front office. And since he didn't sign a free-agent contract on Dec. 31, 2002, the Lakers haven't added a point guard until March.|0
"Students wishing to continue study of Italian must take the placement test before the start of the semester.

"While the SP-BSP-RLD alliance may disrupt the caste math in many pockets, the Congress is relegated to the role of leader. In Delhi's south, the coalition government and its supporters have been forced to retreat from two districts that have been a stronghold of social movements: Chhattisgarh and Jaipur. ""The BJP is not allowed to sit on the Supreme Court bench until next year,"" said Rajiv Pratap, one of the most senior lawmakers in the state. The BJP is also being asked to step down from the Central Pollution Control Board for failing to follow norms and comply with pollution control guidelines."|0

When I opened the brown clasp envelope and pulled out the 21-page spiral book, I was startled. Dr. Jones is not a pianist. I’ve been having a good laugh at myself about it these last few weeks. (I guess I really do need hearing aids.) I told the story when I spoke to the Barrington Hall Garden Club last week, and the ladies got a chuckle out of it. Dr. Jones is passionate about peonies. At one time, he had 120 peony plants blooming in the backyard of his former home on Hillandale Circle.|1
If you can't find figs, layer the cream and the crunch here onto whichever fruits are in season. I am not sure how many strawberries there are left but I do know that if you have one, it may be delicious. You'll want to place it on the side of the pot or on a crockpot, because the fruit will stick to the pan better than any other kind of vegetables. A big bowl is good, just like with a regular bowl!

""What we need to focus on is getting people involved in politics."" There are two main political debates happening here in the state of Maryland — one that pits liberal Democratic lawmakers against the right-wing Republican government and one that pits conservatives against liberals. It might surprise you to know that Maryland has twice as many Democrats as Republicans as it does Republicans, even though both have a majority in the Senate."|0
BATON ROUGE—Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin is warning voters to be aware of who they discuss their private information with in light of a potential voter registration scam that surfaced this week. While our office has not received reports of the potential scam in Louisiana, election officials in several states have confirmed residents receiving calls impersonating an organization that provides voter registration assistance. The callers are offering to register residents over the phone, and in some cases, to send the voter an absentee ballot. In Louisiana, residents cannot register to vote or request an absentee ballot by phone.|1
The new law finishes old business in Trenton and expands the so-called Tuition Equality Act, which let qualified immigrants apply for college and vocational training. President Barack Obama on Tuesday released a plan to increase access to affordable health care as his first major foreign policy initiative. He called for a $2.8 trillion budget to improve health insurance coverage for all Americans. But lawmakers say there is still much too much money out of reach, especially given that the United States spends about $3 trillion on its health care needs each year. The president wants to spend at least 1 percent of U.S. taxpayer dollars on health care.|0
Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the hard work required to maintain it. Amid the hubbub of shopping centers and the din of traffic from nearby Hwy. 61, the cemetery sandwiched between McDonald's and Tires Plus seems jarringly out of place. Few pause to notice the prim patch of well-tended green, bounded by an iron fence, that holds some of Cottage Grove's earliest pioneers. The cemetery, designated a historic site by the Washington County Historical Society, has ties to the founders of Mars Inc., the giant candy manufacturing company.|1
Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit has ended its investigation into the death of a 43-year-old Rideau Lakes man who allegedly shot himself after receiving a phone call from police. The incident occurred on the afternoon of June 3, in the Township of Rideau Lakes, just west of Smiths Falls, when an Ontario Provincial Police officer contacted the man and told him he would be arrested. Shortly afterward, at 3:20 p.m., the man called 911 reporting that he had sustained a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police and paramedics responded to the call and the man was taken to Ottawa Civic Hospital by air ambulance.|1
It has seemed for a while as though the global financial storm was going to deal a mostly glancing blow to the technology industry. Everybody hurts when markets go into free fall (and, as we're writing this on Wednesday afternoon, the Dow Jones has just closed down another 189 points -- although, as always, it could be up 500 points again by the time you read this). But if Wall Street and the banking sector are having a tornado rip through their gilded trailer parks, tech has, thus far, mostly just experienced some rain and a few gusts of wind in its relatively quiet suburb.|1
"Student Senators passed a resolution that would have NYU divest from three companies associated with the Israeli government and institute an independent university. The resolution had been drafted as a response to President Donald Trump's recent comments about U.S.-Israeli relations, which he accused of being designed to create ""a false equivalency"" between Israelis and Palestinians. The resolution has received strong criticism, however, from some within the academic community. E-mails reveal Clinton aide Huma Abedin was under close surveillance during her time at Bill and Hillary Clinton's campaign headquarters in early 2007, according to the documents obtained by The New York Times."|0
PASSENGERS are now banned from drinking alcohol purchased from duty free shops under new rules. It's hoped that this ban will pave the way for a more sustainable environment and give consumers better access to care. An Iraqi man was killed Thursday after his vehicle rammed into a crowded market in Baghdad, killing at least 18 people and injuring eight others as he tried to leave it. Local media reported that two men were among the casualties, aged 20 to 24. The attack came just months after ISIS launched a series of mass car bombings across the country – killing over 100 people last month.|0
In a democracy, it is said, we get the government we deserve. The same can be said of bestselling guru prescriptives. Malcolm Gladwell's new book What the Dog Saw, a compilation of some of his favorite New Yorker pieces, has drawn both praise and criticism. Personally, I'm not a big Gladwell fan. Shoot me. I'm told he's an interesting person. And he knows how to tell a good anecdote. But, at the risk of oversimplifying my critique of his work ... he oversimplifies.|1
Over the next few months, many federal employees will receive performance ratings. Some may believe their ratings to be unreasonably low. What can be done? There is a review process for most employees, but that process generally functions within the agency’s control (with exceptions for bargaining unit employees and successful equal employment opportunity complainants) and is often criticized as being unfriendly to complaining employees. Nonetheless, an appeal might be successful if an employee is careful, thorough and able to strike the right notes. Appeals take numerous forms. Following is a summary of different groups of employees and how the processes may differ.|1

Weather Underground on the Weather Channel: Highly gender-normative interactions. The lady sits behind the bar when the men are talking. This week the Weather Channel, mainstay of bored insomniacs and families on vacation in Florida, debuted a new weekday prime-time live show about the weather. Problem is, the show, Weather Underground, is set in what appears to be a 40-year-old storm chaser’s parents’ basement and features highly gender-normative interactions between its slew of male meteorologists and its single female presenter, Sarah Dillingham. Dillingham is working on a master’s degree in atmospheric sciences and appears on-camera during every segment of the two-hour show.|1

( Reuters ) - British serviced office space provider IWG Plc said on Wednesday it would close or refurbish some of its premises in south central London and South East London within a year if Brexit were triggered by the UK leaving the customs union.

A spokesman said that IWG Plc has been unable to deliver on its promised €100m (£79m) investment target for 2017.|0
"MILLERSBURG -- If laughter really is the best medicine, then the people who turned out for the inaugural Standup Comedy Night were served a very healthy dose of humor. On Saturday, Nov. 9, 14 performers shared their funniest routines and tickled funny bones in the Buckeye Room at Hotel Millersburg. This casual non-competitive event raised $160 to sponsor four aspiring authors to attend the Wayne Writers Workshop at the University of Akron Orrville next April. It was Denice Hazlett's first-time attempt at standup. ""There are a lot of funny people around here!"" Hazlett noted."|1
Labour leader Ed Miliband doesn't have an image problem, he has a policy problem. The problem is he doesn't have any, or at least policies that answer the gravity of the situation. Millions of people suffer as inflation outstrips wages. The cost of food, transport, fuel and housing skyrocket. A million people have visited food banks. This is not only a joyless recovery, for the vast majority of people it's a moneyless one. A smirking George Osborne may don a hi-vis jacket and march through building sites in Northern England to boast of recovery.|1

Media & Entertainment I write about women in the business of Hollywood. New research released today from the Geena Watson Research Center at Columbia University sheds new light on the role that sexism plays in TV and film. It finds that women are more likely to be cast as female-based villains than male-based ones, especially in films. It's hard to say how long it takes you to fall asleep after watching a television commercial (or even listening to your iPhone). But we all know the time when it comes to sleep.

American troops may have finally left Iraq, but for that nation's citizens the war is only getting worse,' Iraqi Foreign Minister Adel al-Hassan told a conference this week. When you think about what could have come out of all the trouble, it can be hard to know what has happened since 2003. I don't really want to do this post again - but I still want to share some interesting insights into an otherwise dark area of American politics. A little over a year ago, the Democratic Party had a much more progressive agenda than its GOP predecessor.|0

WASHINGTON – Congress is moving to put under military control all armed contractors operating in combat zones, a Pentagon recommendation that could run into resistance at the State Department.

North Korean hacking group focuses attacks on aging and soon-to-be-deprecated technology. Five-Star hackers: High-end hotel data thieves return to target government officials The DarkHotel hacking group has returned -- but this time they're focusing on a different target, using a new strain of Inexsmar malware. Internet Explorer's scripting engine was the favorite target of a North Korean cyber-espionage group this year, after the hackers deployed two zero-days, but also crafted new exploits for two other older vulnerabilities. The group's name is DarkHotel, a cyber-espionage group that McAfee and many other cyber-security firms have already linked to the Pyongyang regime.|1
To any objective observer, the consensus that exists between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the fundamental issues of war and peace, Wall Street’s dominance of American life, and fiscal austerity, has been made crystal clear in the two “debates.” In the absence of effective popular resistance to the duopoly of money, the economic and social crisis fails to create a corresponding political crisis for the rulers. As a result, there is nothing important for them to debate. The two titans of America’s finance capitalist duopoly clashed – leaving behind a dull fart.|1

Although there’s long been a debate over the accuracy of health information online, many U.S. Internet users aren’t hesitant to use the Web when they want answers to health-related questions. And rather than dedicated health sites, the vast majority of them begin their research at a search engine. A new study out tonight from the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project says that 72 percent of U.S. Internet users have gone online in the past year specifically for health-related information, and 77 percent of that group says their research started at Google, Bing or another general search engine.|1

With their invention of the longship, the Vikings spurred a literal sea change in medieval European affairs. The drekar, or dragon-headed longships, were stealthy troop-carriers.|1

In a study from 24/7 Wall Street, Leelanau County was named Michigan's most expensive housing market with a median annual cost of less than $70 million, according to the National Association of Realtors.

In other words, average rents are about the same for single people and young families, so it doesn't really matter who owns it or how much they pay off their loans. This can make a lot of sense: rental properties tend to have higher ceilings and lower values than existing land.|0

The British are known for their collective stiff upper lip. The elements of British style translate easily in every language. We know how a man should speak and how a wife should dress, so much so that we can hardly say no to such things when they do happen. In other words, it's one thing to say that something is wrong with Britain, but to say that British style isn't as great as it was would be to admit that some of them are simply the result of centuries-old cultural misunderstandings.|0

For millions of Americans who are unemployed, under employed and being foreclosed on, it seems inconceivable that corporate CEOs can be getting significant raises at a time of such economic hardship.|1

“Overwatch” was pristine out of the box. The character and level design were excellent. It combined elements of hits “Team Fortress 2” and “League of Legends” to create something completely new. But for a multiplayer game to have any longevity, it needs to consistently improve and add new content. 20 millionBlizzard announced in October that “Overwatch” had hit 20 million players in its first five months. “Overwatch” took a step back in late June when it unveiled a deeply flawed competitive mode, but it rallied the following month.|1

Amazon.com's purchase of Austin-based Whole Foods Market is showing up in the wine category. As this year ends, Amazon has shut down Wine.Woot and its own wine marketplace in favor of Whole Foods' expansive wine operation. Now that Amazon owns Whole Foods, a licensed seller of wine, it comes under different state laws and can't sell directly from a producer. As a result, Dallas entrepreneur Matt Rutledge sees an opening in the marketplace. When Amazon.com purchased daily deals site Woot.com, based in Carrollton, in 2010 it also acquired Wine.Woot, a direct producer-to-consumer website that Amazon adopted for its own wine marketplace.|1

Beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl is never easy. When they scored 21 points the first three times that night, the New England defense didn't even give up a scoring drive. But when they started getting involved late in the fourth quarter, Brady was just doing his job.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - The leader of Thailand’s military junta said on Thursday that Yingluck Shinawatra, the prime minister he ousted three years ago, was in Dubai, where she fled last month to avoid being jailed over a rice subsidy scheme that lost billions of dollars. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the army chief who led the coup, said Thailand would pursue Yingluck through diplomatic channels and police cooperation using Interpol. His remarks came a day after the country’s top court found Yingluck guilty of criminal negligence and sentenced her in absentia to five years in prison.|1
Is a roving, body-scanning van a needed surveillance tool or a another step toward eroding personal privacy? Andy R. Hildebrander, the former deputy director of the FBI's Center for Advanced National Security Investigations, has long advocated for a federal court to order an overhaul of the criminal code, and his proposal would open a way for individuals to be prosecuted and sentenced even where it is unclear if there are other avenues to stop them.

When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher, only the deepest, most corrosive cynicism is possible. Trampling on the margins of American politics and culture, the Obama campaign was able to build a strong following among its own black youth. In many ways it was more about the fact that people from all over the world supported his candidacy than about what they would think he stood for. In order to ensure that you are safe in the first place, you need to have the appropriate protection. You need to be sure there is a police officer present to secure your life while you are under arrest.|0
Under Trump, presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor. Since discovering that the constitution gives him the somewhat controversial power to absolve criminals who are also his friends, Donald Trump has pardoned more people and commuted more sentences in his first 18 months in office than any of his three immediate predecessors. The pardoning spree continued on Tuesday, as Trump issued two more before jetting off to Europe to stomp all over NATO, this time clearing the names of father-son arsonist duo Dwight and Steven Hammond, Oregon cattle ranchers whose 2016 fight against the federal government became a conservative cause célèbre.|1

Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child’s play, thanks to MIT. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a parser that imitates kids’ learning processes by observing the environment and making connections. The system studies captioned videos and learns to associate words with objects and actions. When given a new sentence, the parser can accurately predict its meaning—without visual clues. This “weakly supervised” approach, which requires limited training input, could expand the types of data and reduce the effort needed for training parsers. Annotations can certainly speed up the process, but they’re not needed to learn.|1
So, what ’ s next after all of the early NBA free agency buzz? Nothing like what ’s happened in Milwaukee or Philadelphia, when some teams were more than willing to put a player on the court.

He signed with the Heat for $837,000 in 2012-13, but did not get any kind of contract extension.|0

The Brexit crowd refused to believe the experts in the run-up to the referendum vote. The warnings from every leading economic body, including the Bank of England, were dismissed as scaremongering that should be ignored.

Cristiano Ronaldo, 33, leads the competition's scoring charts for a remarkable fifth year in a row and has made more than his fair share of mistakes. A Canadian woman was sentenced to 30 days in prison after police arrested her 13-year-old daughter on two separate occasions last week. An investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ) into alleged sexual misconduct with 17-year-old teen student Cristiano Fernandez led to a charge of unlawful sexual contact, which carries a sentence of up to eight years in prison plus $500,000 fine. She is expected to spend the rest of her sentence Tuesday afternoon in Manhattan Superior Court.|0
If you live along the Eastern Seaboard and wake up early Friday you could be treated to a colorful sky hours before sunrise lights up the horizon. The Terrier-Improved Malumute sounding rocket is scheduled for launch Friday between 4:26 a.m. and 4:41 a.m. ET. Sounding rockets, by the way, have been used for over 40 years to carry science payloads on brief, 5-20 minute missions to space. Friday morning should provide mostly clear skies in the viewing location, and upper level winds should be friendly enough to allow the launch to take place (if not, backup launch dates are available each morning through June 6).|1
"Minister for Enterprise and Commerce, Max Bradford, today rejected claims by the Engineers Union that jobs created by the Employment Contracts Act are predominantly casual, part-time and low-paid. ""The ECA is the most successful piece of industrial relations legislation in New Zealand's history and attempts by the Secretary of the Engineers Union, to brand it as a failure are laughable"", said Mr Bradford. ""The success of the ECA sticks in the throat of Unions, because it has delivered what they couldn't: more jobs and higher wages.  industrial disputes have fallen to their lowest level since 1935."|1

ASTANA, Kazakhstan—Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s first and only president, resigned on Tuesday, ending his nearly 30-year reign and setting the stage for an opaque succession process in the oil-rich Central Asian country of 18 million people. As his speech hinted, Nazarbayev’s departure from office will not mean giving up the reins of power. The aging leader, who has led Kazakhstan since 1989, when it was still part of the Soviet Union, said that Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the speaker of the Senate and a trusted political ally of Nazarbayev, will take over as acting president until new elections are held in 2020.|1

The judge released a summary statement on Wednesday that includes specific allegations against two other defendants. He was joined by three other defendants and six co-defendants in filing a defense motion. Prosecutors say they have not found enough evidence to move forward with an arrest warrant.|0

What's the difference between bipolar I and bipolar II? Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that causes severe mental impairment. That means there's more to it than just how bipolar you are. It can be overwhelming for most patients who are taking anti-convulsants or certain drugs, which may include medications for schizophrenia, depression, dementia, and anxiety disorders. If you have bipolar disorder, you won't be able to go to school and you won't be able to do math because of your bipolar disorder problem. And bipolar II does not cause sudden death—it lasts only for a few months.|0

An extra $190,000 in state special education reimbursement funding that came in late last month has helped the town pay off its nearly half million-dollar settlement with the district's bus drivers union, officials said this week. Together with around $300,000 in savings found in the district's fiscal 2011 budget, the money has covered the town's $497,000 obligation to the drivers, whose jobs have been outsourced to a private busing company. The additional special education money, part of the state's circuit breaker program, will prevent the town from having to carry the debt over into fiscal 2012, officials said.|1
BAGHDAD -- The Iraqi government launched an investigation yesterday into the apparent torture of detainees in a secret Interior Ministry jail after the US military found 173 prisoners inside who appeared to have been abused, Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari said. It was the first time that the country's US-backed government installed in April had acknowledged the possible abuse of prisoners at one of its facilities.

With snow falling steadily and the temperature well below freezing, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she's joining the group of Democrats running for president and would take her campaign -- and her Midwest sensibilities -- directly to parts of the region Donald Trump won and that her party wants to recapture in 2020 . Klobuchar, who easily won a third-term last year, is the most prominent candidate from the Midwest to enter the race. Klobuchar had worked with then Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., to help fund the new bridge and get it completed at a faster-than-usual pace.|1
He’s eaten dog food and appeared nearly naked on telly, but comedian Alex Horne has revealed his most embarrassing moment on television came when he appeared on Mastermind.

"HIGH POINT, N.C. — A dentist lost her license after two patients died, according to a Final Agency Decision report from the North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners. Shawana Neopi Patterson, who was first licensed in 2011, was an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at her practice Patterson Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in High Point. In one instance, the report found that Patterson took little action when one patient turned ""bluish-gray,"" and only called EMS for a second patient once she had no pulse. The report revealed two cases in which patients provided medical histories that indicated they should have only undergone surgery under emergencies."|1

Who is K P Sharma Oli? The new prime minister of Nepal, K P Sharma Oli gained popularity when he announced that India and Bangladesh will join the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan as a key partner. This is an extremely important development for the government of Nepal. The country, with a population of over 30 million was the largest economy in the world at the time of writing.

It didn't have the highest success rate when it came to matches this season, with only Melissa Walsh (14% success rate) coming up with 10 goals in his first two games after a break from Manchester United. His last three games saw him score 25 or more goals, all of whom came on target. Last week at Everton, he scored 18 goals in 24 Premier League matches, one more than David Villa and two more than Roberto Di Matteo. It may be difficult to pinpoint who is the better finisher, however, with no other team producing more goals per league match than Liverpool.|0
I lived in Oshkosh for 14 years up until 2003. My hangar was adjacent to the self-serve. Our team members took care of all the repairs and were able to take part in the repair project.

A jaunt through October's art highlights. Eighty-eight-year-old Jack McLarty has had a distinguished career, with an exhibition history stretching back to the 1940s and artworks housed in collections such as the Smithsonian Institution's. His paintings this month at Broderick show evidence of his fascination with Central and South America. A riot of tropicalia, The Garden of Good and Evil is all parrots, crucifixes, Dia de los Muertos skulls and anacondas wrapped around naked women's legs. The best of McLarty's works have a kooky exuberance, executed with a neo-Impressionist technique and a folk artist's naivetÉ.|1
The Jawbone Up debuted last year with big ambitions: A bracelet-like device that you'd wear all the time, tracking how much you move and how well you sleep. Paired with an app, the Up helps you recognize patterns in your habits, empowering you to improve your health. One problem: It wasn't built to withstand the punishment of being a wearable device. Unlike a cellphone that resides in your pocket or a bag, the Up wraps around your wrist, exposed to the world just as much as your skin is. Many users found it quickly malfunctioned, and Jawbone recalled the Up and issued refunds.|1

It's hard to imagine that 2001 : A Space Odyssey would have its incredible cinematic impact without that classical setting. I'm a big fan of this series – it just so happens to be one of my favourite books ever published by Amazon. It's a brilliant story of exploration, adventure and sacrifice, full of humour, all wrapped into one very good ending. However, given that it has no title and the film is still in production, why not take a look through the archives and see for yourself how much it was produced?|0

"The Brexit crowd refused to believe the experts in the run-up to the referendum vote.

Fast bowler Matt Hobden has been tipped for a bright future as he bids to bounce back from one of the darkest days in his fledgling career. Hobden’s encouraging start to the season came to a grinding halt in the previous Championship match against Middlesex at Hove. The 22-year-old from Eastbourne lost his rhythm completely as he committed 11 no-balls in 16 overs in the first innings and another three in the second. His struggles were highlighted by an injury to Ajmal Shahzad on the opening day which prevented skipper Ed Joyce from withdrawing him from the attack.|1

The violence against women and girls is unprecedented in the United States since the Civil Rights Movement took root in the mid-1830s.

We chose to question the narrative of history by simply quoting words which Churchill used himself.

In recent years, platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their artistry. For the generation of designers who grew up playing “Super Mario Bros.” platformers offer a sound formula. Though the goal of such games is usually to get from one area to the next, that framework supports copious possibilities. Determining how a character moves through a world and what sorts of things should impede or assist in the process allows plenty of room for creativity. It is why games like “Journey” and “Inside” can both be constructed around jumping avatars but otherwise appear quite distinct.|1

However, the minister pointed out that investment in infrastructure is a good thing and promised to get rid of ""a lot"" of its excesses, adding that he will be making improvements to roads and bridges in his ministry's next decade. I'm going to take this opportunity to tell you it's one of the best things my family has ever enjoyed!"|0
If you are a soda drinker unable to decide between healthier homemade sodas and your favorite off-the-shelf Coke, the upcoming Keurig Cold at-home beverage maker might be your savior. While this is positive for consumers, the impact for sellers of soda-makers and sodas isn't straightforward. In early February, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) announced that it entered into a 10-year agreement to collaborate with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (UNKNOWN:GMCR.DL) on the development of its global brand portfolio for use in Green Mountain's upcoming Keurig Cold at-home beverage system. Coca-Cola will also be taking a 10% stake in Green Mountain.|1
ARSENE WENGER last night confessed he passed up the chance to buy Didier Drogba – for just £100,000! The Arsenal boss could have landed the super striker seven years ago, while he was playing for lowly French outfit Le Mans in the French Second Division. But Wenger stressed he was not the only manager to snub a player who went on to join today’s FA Cup semi-final opponents Chelsea for £24m two years later. “Don’t forget all the French clubs watched him,” he pointed out. “Nobody took him. He went from Le Mans to Guingamp.|1

Cecchinato, who had never won a Grand Slam match in his career before this year's Roland Garros, prevailed in an epic fourth set tiebreak to win the match 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 1-6, 7-6 (13-11), becoming the lowest-ranked semifinalist at Roland Garros since No."|1
The movement is a global phenomenon – but here it has stalled before even getting started. RIDESHARING SERVICES WHICH supporters claim could spare Irish cities from gridlock are being effectively locked out of the country on the grounds of breaking taxi laws. Transport officials have recently questioned one of the industry’s newest entrants, a carpooling app backed by entrepreneur and Dragon’s Den investor Sean O’Sullivan, on how it fits within rules that have already seen similar operators abandon the market. But Cork-based startup Carma Carpooling claims it is only promoting the kind of ridesharing setups neighbours and colleagues have been doing for decades.|1
New Delhi : The ruling Communist Party of India ( Marxist ), or CPM, is prepared for a third term in office by the end of 2017 after taking power last year.

The eight-episode 1980s-set drama will air in the summer. Mere weeks after finishing production on the pilot and securing a series order, the cast and creators of Ryan Murphy's newest FX drama, Pose, met reporters Friday at the Television Critics Association's winter press tour where they touted the realness of the drama that explores the ball culture. Pose looks at the juxtaposition of several segments of life and society in 1980s New York: the rise of the luxury Trump-era universe, the downtown social and literary scene, and the ball culture world.|1

The site, targeted at young adults, was unveiled by Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim at the Al-Iman Mosque in Bukit Panjang. Asked if LearnIslam.sg was created to counter websites which may have radical messages, Dr Yaacob said this would narrow the potential of the site.|1
In the age of Instagram, food is no longer designed to just be food. It’s a set piece, a lifestyle statement of fantastical hyperbole. So we drink unicorn lattes, eat rainbow bagels, and lick our charcoal-black soft serve in front of neon signs. Food is no longer about eating. It’s about the documentation of unattainable perfection, catching the next ever-illusive meme. Yet in this new wave of food-as-influencer, there is a single, curmudgeonly brand that insists on photographing its dishes on conference room tables, under fluorescent lighting, and from all sorts of unflattering angles.|1

Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of flaws in the way universal credit is designed, campaigners say. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG ) said arbitrary rules built in to the way universal credit is calculated leave some families unable to predict how much they will be paid each month, leaving households in debt and unable to budget. It can lead to claimants being wrongly benefit-capped – a penalty designed to “incentivise” jobless or low-earning households by severely limiting their benefits – because the system fails to spot they are working and earning enough.|1
Many Alberta small-business owners, who have been struggling through a prolonged economic downturn, are hoping the next provincial government will bring relief through business-friendly policies. The Alberta election is April 16 and polls suggest that Rachel Notley’s ruling New Democrats will be replaced with Jason Kenney’s United Conservatives, which have campaigned to scrap the carbon tax and loosen some labour rules that have driven up business costs. Over the past two years, small-business confidence in Alberta has reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the country, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which has been tracking the measure for about 20 years.|1
The Australian telecommunications (telco) industry is largely responsible for the highly connected and digital world we live in today. Their networks and services have fostered professional work environments and have brought together family and friends amidst Australia’s vast distances, and remote global position. But to continue doing so at an ever-changing pace, telco providers must accelerate their digital revolution. In fact Accenture, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, has estimated that digitalisation could contribute approximately $100 trillion in value to the telecommunications industry over the next decade globally. Australian telecommunications operators have long maintained vast networks, held together by complex infrastructure.|1
French President Emmanuel Macron wants to invigorate the European Union as a global power and spurn the populist nationalism that threatens to undermine its success. But he knows it requires cooperation with the United States—which makes his strange bedfellow in the White House so crucial to his agenda. This piece originally appeared in the Washington Post. Macron, who at 40 is three decades younger than Trump, disdains the president’s abrasive nature and many of his policies, notably on Iran and climate change. The French president prefers books, ideas and lofty intellectual conversation to the aggressive transactional style embodied by Trump, who favors television over written text.|1

Recent Jewish visitors especially liked tracing their own origins right there at the museum, while non-Jewish visitors found the exhibits educational and engaging. Beit Hatfutsot is located on the Tel Aviv University campus about 5 miles north of the downtown area.|1
The analysis performed by the team’s members, some of whom acted as observers during 2013 local elections in Estonia, revealed that sophisticated attackers, like those employed by nation states, could easily compromise the integrity of the country’s Internet voting system and influence the election outcome, often without a trace. The team chose to analyze the Estonian system because Estonia has one of the highest rates of Internet voting participation in the world—over 21 percent of the total number of votes during the last local election were cast through the electronic voting system.|1

JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar: for more than two decades, women have been making a monthly pilgrimage to pray at one of Judaism’s holiest sites in a manner traditionally preserved for men, and the police have stopped them in the name of maintaining public order.

Hundreds have digital say on how they manage their health and wellbeing. Last year Healthier Lancashire and South Cumbria came close to launching a new online clinic at the same location, but it failed to meet the demand of patients because the facility did not have any staff.

When Pacers coach Frank Vogel announced he would sit all five starters for last night's game against the Bucks, it was like a thought experiment come to life. Can a good team's second unit beat the starters of a historically awful team? It was close, but...yes! The game was an exciting one, if only from a theoretical standpoint: You desperately wanted to see what would happen, but not necessarily actually watch it go down. Because this wasn't Copeland and Solomon Hill and C.J. Watson getting meaningful minutes in just any late-season game—this game mattered.|1
"That's how I would characterize my minimal pre-service time. Fortunately and unfortunately though, I had very little time before my theoretical learning and my practical experience collided. Teaching was a second career and since I was a young twenty something with a rent, I couldn't afford to do all of my learning before I got into the classroom. Back in those days it was called ""alternative route."" The wisdom was to place an extremely green teacher in a high-need school with a mentor and let them learn on the job rather than with a traditional program."|1
"It takes a community to help migrant workers who need affordable medical care and social assistance. This is the most visible of its kind in Bangladesh.

""We thank you for helping so many people, but not all,"" Karim wrote. The U.N. said in a report released Wednesday that more than 1,000 refugees had sought shelter here in the past five years, with 2,400 coming from Bangladesh."|0
To any objective observer, the consensus that exists between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the fundamental issues of climate change seems to stem from the fact that both men are often quoted as saying that we should take action to reduce carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas which is one of the primary causes of climate change and leading to millions of premature deaths worldwide. I started writing about my life story in October 2015 when it hit the web. It was an amazing experience but it only lasted a few days. By then, I had written more than 200 books, and over 2 million Twitter followers.|0

Jill McGown, who has died aged 59 from cancer, was one of the generation of crime writers who shifted the genre firmly into the contemporary world.

She will be best remembered for the 13 novels featuring Chief Inspector Danny Lloyd and Sergeant Judy Hill. Theirs was a relationship that encompassed the personal as well as the professional, and Jill's deft handling of its development was one of the keynote elements of the books.|1
Promises to replace houses sold off under the Right to Buy scheme look increasingly hollow as the Government slashes council tax, and promises to reduce public spending. There was a huge amount of chatter about what might be a major overhaul of Scotland's education system over the past few years, but in fact the country has found itself on the wrong side of history, one that can only be addressed with some tinkering and new policies. As the nation seeks to improve the quality of its educational system without cutting social benefits, it now faces a daunting task.|0

A Manitoba woman has been sent to prison for hiding the remains of six infants in a rented storage locker, but court never heard an explanation as to what prompted her to hide the babies she conceived over many years. Andrea Giesbrecht, 43, bit her lip and looked straight ahead, but showed little emotion as she was sentenced Friday to 8 1/2 years. Provincial court Judge Murray Thompson said Giesbrecht’s moral culpability was extreme and the sentence needed to be strong enough to denounce her behaviour. “These were newly delivered infants, our most vulnerable,” Thompson said in his decision that was livestreamed by Winnipeg media.|1

The battle over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ’ s new “ borrower education tool ” unveiled earlier this week by the Trump administration and a bipartisan group led by former New York Gov. George W. Pataki, is perhaps best remembered as a showdown between the two parties in Congress over how much of an impact student loan debt should have on student loan borrowers. If there were ever a presidential candidate who had a clear mandate to get rid of big government, Donald Trump would have it. He wants to cut Medicare, abolish the Social Security trust funds, eliminate health care reform, and privatize the federal government.|0
The AKP should take comfort in its large majority and start to view minority views and even peaceful dissent benignly. The outcome of Turkey's latest general election - voters have gone to the polls twice in the last five months - reveals important insights into the nature of the country's democracy and the preferences of its citizens. The first of Turkey's two parliamentary elections this year, in June, was widely viewed as a referendum on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's efforts to strengthen the powers of his office. The result was clear.|1

There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams's performances that could, roughly, be called his American and British sides. On the American side, there was the slushy tendency towards sentimentality, for which he became increasingly known, which, at its best, resulted in Dead Poets Society, The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire, and, at its worst, became Patch Adams and Old Dogs. Hollywood has long had a tendency to adopt the finest and most interesting comedians and then determinedly blunt the hard edges that make them interesting. Along with Richard Pryor, Williams was the most obvious example of that.|1
"ANTIOCH 6/5/16 – When Trevor Dunning first entered the Trinity Christian School speech class, he was personally greeted, as each student was, and a few words of welcome were exchanged.

While talking, he would suddenly push out a breathy deep, ""UHH...UHH,"" which came every three of four words. It was a severe stutter problem. He had enrolled in my speech class to hopefully be able to speak better."|1

"Crucially though, these guys don't stop at food production. While their commercial services seem to focus on landscaping and food production planning for now, the team is also involved in research on designing low impact, low energy, resilient structures that can withstand future shocks—be they natural storms and other challenges, or man-made disasters such as peak oil. Based out of a purpose-built multi-purpose dwelling at the research farm, Whole Systems Design clearly puts an emphasis on low tech, appropriate and ""passively survivable"" sustainability features, by which they mean systems that can keep operating if there is an interruption of power supply or other crucial resources."|1

I don't think it'll be long before I am reminded that there is another big issue affecting the American public: how often women use contraceptives. In fact, one major cause for this is widespread abortion-related pregnancies, according to new studies by researchers from the University of Wisconsin–Madison's Reproductive Health Program. (A 2011 study by the University found that 23 percent of women using birth control in 2012 used it in the last nine months.)|0
The movement is a global phenomenon – but here it has stalled before even getting started. RIDESHARING SERVICES WHICH TRUST FOR HUMAN RESOURCES CANNOT FALL OUT OF BRIEF. It is not only because of lack of interest from customers but because you cannot afford to do business anywhere in the UK except in Europe. This makes them very unlikely to have a customer base that is keen on the idea of joining a bicycle service provider. If they do, then their business will be affected by any loss of business if they decide to seek a new partner.|0

The charges are still being contested, and police say it's unclear whether the crime is terrorism or a misunderstanding.

Or not. In the world of digital photography, you don't have to flash a smile. Instead, just digitally paint a grin on your face afterward. Struggling for hours to get just the right shot under the optimum lighting conditions is so analog. Today, digital photography allows any wannabe Ansel Adams to create a photographic masterpiece in homage to the 20th century landscape marvel. And with a good smartphone camera and the right camera app, the tools are in everyone's hands. In the past couple of years, editing apps that create different styles of pictures have become much more sophisticated and robust.|1
"I lived in Oshkosh for 14 years up until 2003. My hangar was adjacent to the self-serve. Our pre-Air Venture entertainment was to sit by the hangar and watch the incoming. Saw some accidents, some close calls, but mostly good. Watched the incoming and this past event, 2018, looked to have some of the poorer arrival flying I have seen in the many years. The one comment that comes close to probably covering it all was a pilot some years back who caused some real havoc when asked why he did not adhere to the NOTAM, said, ""what NOTAM?"""|1
The tenth * annual Woodstock of skepticism, The Amaz! ng Meeting, was just announced for 2012! The meeting has been held since 2001 and has taken place twice a year, so it's no surprise to find a crowd of skeptical people eager to hear what the group is thinking. In fact, in this one, I'd like to focus on the last time we heard from an actual speaker. So far, I'm not familiar enough with the details to know whether it's true or not. We can assume there's a lot of skepticism about the group.|0

Schrödinger's cat was merely a thought experiment. But now it's going to be tested in real life for the first time. You've probably heard of Schrödinger's cat, a famous thought experiment posited by Erwin Schrödinger that suggested putting a cat in a suspended quantum state where it is simultaneously alive and dead. Schrödinger merely meant it as a thought experiment — he didn't intend to toy with the life of a real, living cat."|1

"Sunni Fighters Returning To Al-Qaida In Iraq, 'NYT' Reports : The Two-Way After months of being squeezed out by the Shi'ite led government, there are increasing reports that men who used to fight against al-Qaida are now being recruited by them. The success of the ""surge"" in Iraq was based on a number of things beyond the introduction of more American troops and their counter insurgency strategy. Among them, cease fire by Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army, the ethnic cleansing of Baghdad, and the Sunni Awakening. The Awakening was made up of Sunnis who turned against al-Qaida in Iraq in their areas."|1

Today marks the 314th anniversary of the last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. Geological records indicate that this 9.0 magnitude quake struck around 9 p.m. Jan. 26, 1700, along the 620-mile fault line that stretches off mid-Vancouver Island to northern California. But as with all anniversaries of major disasters, we can find a silver lining � in this case, the progress and commitment local agencies and governments have made toward increasing resilience when the next Cascadia earthquake strikes. Oregon�s offshore seismic fault mirrors the subduction zone that caused the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami that killed thousands of people and destroyed entire villages.|1

Labour leader Ed Miliband doesn't have an image problem, he has a policy problem. The problem is that, despite being one of the most successful Labour leaders in this election and a member of the Cabinet, he has also spent much of the campaign pledging to spend less than the current average politician. He doesn't seem to understand why politicians are reluctant to spend less – especially when all they need is a little bit of money. On June 28, President Trump signed an executive order revoking federal funding for government agencies with a broad definition of how the federal government should pay for their services.|0
