With snow falling steadily and the temperature well below freezing, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she's joining the group of Democrats running for president and would take her campaign -- and her Midwest sensibilities -- directly to parts of the region Donald Trump won and that her party wants to recapture in 2020 . Klobuchar, who easily won a third-term last year, is the most prominent candidate from the Midwest to enter the race. Klobuchar had worked with then Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., to help fund the new bridge and get it completed at a faster-than-usual pace.|1

Most people have heard of Scrooge, even if they have never read A Christmas Carol or any other work of Charles Dickens, writes Adrian Hattrell. What is certain is that they have never experienced the story in the form of a folk opera, which is what was presented to Tickhill Music Society by the group calling itself Green Matthews and Guest – which comprised of Chris Green, Sophie Matthews and Jude Rees. The players set the scene with a medley of Victorian carols, music hall songs and folk songs, accompanying themselves on an astonishing range of period instruments, which were variously blown, plucked and squeezed.|1
The battle over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s new “borrower education tool” unveiled earlier this week is heating up, with the National Association of Mortgage Bankers now joining the Mortgage Bankers Association in calling on the CFPB to take the “Rate Checker” online tool down. The CFPB’s new interactive page has come under fire because it mentions rates and costs without including disclosure items that TILA-RESPA rules mandate for borrowers – annual percentage rate, closing fees, etc. “This tool will do nothing but confuse consumers in their shopping experience,” said John Councilman, president of NAMB.|1

"A truck slammed into a fire hydrant on Western Avenue in San Pedro on Thursday morning , creating a geyser -like spray of water and obstructing traffic

The police and firefighters immediately responded and started shutting off water valves as quickly as possible. Nearby businesses, including two bars and a tire shop, were warned about potential damage caused by flooding, but fortunately no major damage occurred. The crash also left a massive sinkhole that took the entire afternoon to clean up. Local residents found a shocking but amusing sight during their commute as traffic was backed up along Western Avenue."|0
"For Bruce Logan, microbes are an electrifying subject. The Kappe professor of environmental engineering at Pennsylvania State University works on creating alternative-fuel cells powered by anaerobic bacteria. ""Because these bacteria breathe without oxygen they will transfer electrons from their food outside their bodies to an electrode,"" he says. Enough bacteria doing this at the same time will generate a current. At just a few millivolts It won't charge a phone, but it's enough to get a reading.

"The hyperloop train is leaving the station – and the UK must be on it | City A.M. Steve Norris 

There have been numerous reports citing hyperloop transportation projects currently taking place worldwide and Norris believes the UK can’t miss out. Norris expressed his commitment to invest in existing research that can potentially boost connectivity, bring cleaner energy and possibly lower ticket prices in both London and surrounding areas. Moreover, many improvements have to be considered in the way citizens and consumers engage in travel planning; since the rail system in the UK is stretched at full capacity, we could save time, resources and money."|0
Evan Spiegel 's once-buzzy company is laying off employees as it cuts back on hiring . Just a few months  ago, it reported lower profits than analysts had predicted. With their reliance on external markets, Spiegel and Snap have both been exposed to factors beyond their control. These losses demonstrate just how much external variables can affect businesses' outcomes. As of now, layoffs, alongside other cost cutting methods such as a company wide hiring freeze, are helping ease the effect of decreased user growth. Time will tell if these strategies pay off for the struggling company.|0
"The proposal that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to stem migration is nothing but 'hipster ' colonialism . Last  month the Danish immigration minister declared

support of such an initiative citing their intentions of promoting 'the benefits of rural development'. The advocacy has received great backlash with Africans at home and in the diaspora airing their criticism of what is seen as a sign of de facto ‘bondage of its people'. While efforts for creating migration programmes for Africa may help create opportunity on the continent, allowing foreign investors to own large tracts of land goes beyond developmental gains."|0
"The rumor mill is spinning this morning . In the midst of getting divorced from his wife , Vanessa Trump , 

Donald Trump Jr. has reportedly been seen getting close to Fox News Host Kimberly Guilfoyle at various social events. Sources say that the pair even has ""explosive chemistry"" together. As to be expected, both have so far been reluctant to make any statements on the matter. However, fans have quickly taken to social media, airing out opinions on the 'controversial' nature of a relationship like this one. For many, this development would fall in line with what they know of Trump Jr.'s outspoken nature."|0
"John Bennett(July 20), a teacher at Westside Middle School, was upset by the School Board's decision to have teachers teach all sides of any controversy. He is right, of course, that pretending all sides of any controversy are equally valid is nonsense. But a good deal of the issue hinges on our definition of ""teaching"" a position. If ""teaching"" means that the teacher merely presents all sides of a controversy as though they were equal in weight and legitimacy, then we are being equal time indoctrinists."|1
It's not your imagination—but you should blame the candidates, not the media. The father in question has voiced similar complaints. “I think it’s a big mistake; this constant four-year, peripatetic campaign is not good for America. We need to deal with the business we have before us,” Bill Clinton told CNN in December. Of course, neither Clinton is a particularly reliable narrator here, because it’s the third member of the Clinton clan who is responsible for much of the ink that has been spilled about an election still more than two and a half years away.|1

A new study for The New York Times reveals that the media pay for the top 200 CEOs is now $14.5 million. This is up 55 in the last year. While any one CEO may be well worth his/her raise, it is a growing political and PR problem for corporate America to be seen as rewarding those at the top, with little consideration for actual performance. For millions of Americans who are unemployed, under employed and being foreclosed on, it seems inconceivable that corporate CEOs can be getting significant raises at a time of such economic hardship.|1
Sunkett said the running back positions are still up from grabs and that the ground attack will be by committee, at least early in season. A young East St. Louis defensive unit gave up a lot of points a year ago. With three starters returning on the defensive line, a group of strong and quick linebackers and a secondary, which will be led by Thomas, the Flyers should be better this fall. Gone up front is all-American defensive end Terry Beckner Jr . — now at the University of Missouri — but LaMontre’ Harvey, Antuan Quinlin and Terres Lagrome, are quick agile linemen who return.|1

Both Russell and Heal were in disbelief as the wild scenes involving players, officials and fans played out in front of the TV cameras.|1
When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher, only the deepest, most corrosive cynicism is possible. Trampling on the rights of others for political advantage was the modus operandi of Adelaide's Nomenclature Committee in 1837. Western Buddhism and Pentecostalism are sometimes criticised as self-indulgent forms of religion. Is Bishop Spong's Christian humanism any different? The press coverage of Iraq’s surprise victory in the Asian Cup final was — as Ernst Bloch might have put it — full of utopian sentiment. The win was, admittedly, a remarkable achievement, but one that hardly accounted for the sheer exuberance of the outpoured emotion that followed.|1

BUHLER - The south wall of Jim Baker Fieldhouse is considered hallowed ground at Buhler High. It's reserved for the Crusaders' state championship plaques - 36 of them in all.

It has seemed for a while as though the global financial storm was going to deal a mostly glancing blow to the technology industry. Everybody hurts when markets go into free fall (and, as we're writing this on Wednesday afternoon, the Dow Jones has just closed down another 189 points -- although, as always, it could be up 500 points again by the time you read this). But if Wall Street and the banking sector are having a tornado rip through their gilded trailer parks, tech has, thus far, mostly just experienced some rain and a few gusts of wind in its relatively quiet suburb.|1
The right sheet set and pajamas can help you stay cool . Today ’ s memory-foam mattresses do n't sleep  hot and look quite stylish, but if you ’ re hot at night, don't neglect the small things. Consider using sheets made with breathable, high-end fabrics such as bamboo or bamboo blend sheets, cotton sateen and other natural blends to maximize airflow and regulate temperature. Natural fabrics are lighter, breathable and moisture-wicking, resulting in an enhanced sleeping experience. If nightwear is required, opt for natural cotton blends instead of nylon, which can be very unforgiving and unpleasantly sticky in humid or warm conditions.|0
When Pacers coach Frank Vogel announced he would sit all five starters for last night's game against the Bucks, it was like a thought experiment come to life. Can a good team's second unit beat the starters of a historically awful team? It was close, but...yes! The game was an exciting one, if only from a theoretical standpoint: You desperately wanted to see what would happen, but not necessarily actually watch it go down. Because this wasn't Copeland and Solomon Hill and C.J. Watson getting meaningful minutes in just any late-season game—this game mattered.|1

Chipolo Plus is supposedly the loudest Bluetooth item tracker available today, and its chirpy tune can be heard from a greater distance than other similar trackers. Thanks to some useful new tech, items gone missing around the house or office can announce their locations with chirpy ditties — as long as they have Bluetooth trackers attached and you're close enough to hear the trackers' songs. So can you tell the difference between those dB levels? In my tests, I could indeed hear Chipolo Plus a little bit better than the other trackers, though the difference is subtle.|1

Let’s dispense with the question of whether Democrat Ralph Northam is being treated unfairly. His grievous political wounds — by Monday, virtually all Democratic Party luminaries in the state and most Democratic presidential hopefuls had called on him to resign — are self-inflicted. When the photograph from Northam’s Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook surfaced Friday, his first reaction was to issue a statement of abject apology. Tactically, in terms of crisis management, that was the right move — own the transgression and say unambiguously that you’re sorry.|1

She was suffering from progressive supernuclear palsy, a fatal brain disease, and faced a terrible death. In February last year she died as Chris de Burgh’s Here is Your Paradise played at her bedside.|1
Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “Thank You” rally was the crowd’s silence when Trump mentioned that everyone should come together. The irony being that his campaign has been anything but unifying, which is why his supporters backed him. They’re tired of seeing this country’s demographics being changed, their white privilege being challenged. Unity and inclusion is far from what these people want — even after the election’s over. I left Cincinnati tired and disheveled, but perhaps mostly worried about our future.|1

Under Trump , presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor . Since discovering  the power of pardon, Trump has bypassed usual guidelines. Pardons usually require proper paperwork and months-long vetting, but those have largely been tossed aside in the current White House. There have been numerous high-profile pardons of individuals from personal or professional connections of Trump who pleaded their innocence to the President or his close contacts. He's also leaned heavily on preemptive pardons. Through one issued for himself, his children, his lawyers and his ex-aides, Trump hoped to prevent potential prosecutions for criminal conduct related to his presidency.|0

Fish oil . Protein shakes . Vitamin D pills . The packages look alike . Does it matter which you  take? Yes! While the packaging may look similar, there is an important difference between fish oil, protein shakes and Vitamin D pills.

Protein shakes help one's muscle maintenance, being beneficial to muscle growth. Vitamin D pills, on the other hand, support bones by increasing absorption of calcium, especially in dark skinned people, or those living in colder climates with less sun exposure.|0

Running errands on your bicycle is a great way to burn calories and get some exercise.

For example, both the Rogue Valley Mall and the Medford Shopping Center are easily accessible from the Bear Creek Greenway bicycle path. It is somewhat more difficult to ride a bike to the big-box stores along Highway 62 (Crater Lake Highway).|1

If your memory foam mattress leaves you sweating at night, a few remedies can help turn down the heat -- if only by a few degrees.

But for a multiplayer game to have any longevity, it needs to consistently improve and add new content. 20 millionBlizzard announced in October that “Overwatch” had hit 20 million players in its first five months. “Overwatch” took a step back in late June when it unveiled a deeply flawed competitive mode, but it rallied the following month.|1

The pheasant-hunting season in New York is under way , and thanks to a great stocking program hunters should find  good populations of both wild and stocked pheasants across the state this season. Hunters should take special precautions in order to reduce disease and disruption from moving these birds around too much. All hunting should occur on appropriate sites where hunting can take place, as decided by state and local laws. Each year hunters in New York flock to the field in the fall for their opportunity to fill the fields with wild-ringnecked pheasant and non-migratory bobwhite quail hunting.|0

Their 3-2 victory secured Holwell’s spot in the semi-final as Syston led 2-1 heading into the latter stages of the game. As it finished all square, the final had to be decided on spot-kicks, in which Holwell showed tremendous composure to book their place. The big day in July will be especially satisfying for captain Paul Smith and midfielder Jordan Irvine, who have been part of the squad for a total of 26 years combined.|0

"Most people have heard of Scrooge , even if they have never read A Christmas Carol or any other work  of literature featuring this famous character

The idea of a ""Bah, humbug"" outlook to life persists because of the way we see people celebrating Christmas often contrasted to Scrooge’s miserly approach. He rails against carolers and seeing life as a process of deprivation. Most important of all is Scrooge’s transformation as the holidays approach and after his frightening experience of seeing four ghosts. He recognizes his errors of judgment, discovers his love of his late partner Jacob Marley and rouses the importance of seeing Christmases past."|0
In the greatest debate since the color of the dress, people are arguing over what color these pills are. The dress debate blew up online, with some people claiming it was white and gold while others thought it was blue and black. The reason was pegged as linked to how one’s retinas function. Now everyone is arguing over the color of these pills, in a picture widely circulated online over Twitter, Facebook, and other websites. The photo shows two hands holding a pill each, with one hand colored yellow and the other blue.|1
I ’ m still not convinced Foreman is the answer — they ’ d be crazy not to draft a  quarterback in the first round, but do they even know how to win? If Foreman is the answer for the franchise, it still has to prove itself on the field. Reports out of training camp sound promising and the players all appear motivated and confident, but game results are the ultimate determinant of success. That will require changes in offensive philosophy and culture, a creative use of personnel, and of course a combination of sheer luck and timing.|0
I thought I was an acceptable kind of evangelical. I'm not a fundamentalist. My friends and I enjoy art, alcohol, and cultural engagement. We avoid spiritual clichés and buzzwords. We value authenticity, study, racial reconciliation, and social and environmental justice. Being a Christian made me somewhat weird in my urban, progressive context, but despite some clear differences, I held a lot in common with unbelieving friends. We could disagree about truth, spirituality, and morality, and remain on the best of terms. The failures of the church often made me more uncomfortable than those in the broader culture.|1
Media & Entertainment I write about women in the business of Hollywood. New research released today from the Geena Davis Institute on Gender and Media shows that we have a long way to go in our depictions of girls and women onscreen in family-friendly movies. It also showed that countries around the world must do a better job of employing women because, when they do, we see more women and girls onscreen. In their previous research, Dr. Stacy L. Smith, Marc Choueiti, & Dr. Katherine Pieper at the USC Annenberg School of Communications, looked at G, PG and PG-13 rated movies that were released in the US.|1

BAGHDAD -- The Iraqi government launched an investigation yesterday into the apparent torture of detainees in a secret Interior Ministry jail after the US military found 173 prisoners inside who appeared to have been abused, Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari said. It was the first time that the country's US-backed government installed in April had acknowledged the possible abuse of prisoners at one of its facilities. The detainees appeared to have been mostly Sunni Arabs, a group that has long contended that Shi'ite Muslim militias close to the political parties that dominate Iraq's ruling coalition are carrying out a shadowy campaign of vendettas against perceived political and sectarian foes.|1
Promises to replace houses sold off under the Right to Buy scheme look increasingly hollow as the Government slashes council houses' sale price to a third of the cost of replacements. The Government is now selling off council homes at an average price of £59,000, down from over £80,000 before they came to power, a BuzzFeed analysis has shown. The government is selling off the country's remaining council homes at lower prices than ever before despite a soaring housing market. Social tenants have had the 'Right to Buy' their homes at a large discount since Margaret Thatcher introduced the policy in 1980.|1

An injury at work left a husband and father facing a layoff. He couldn't return to the job until his hand healed from surgery, but recovery was complicated by an ongoing struggle with diabetes. With two children in the home, the family saved enough to pay the power bill. Unfortunately, that left very little money for rent. The Clarke County School District contacted the Empty Stocking Fund for help on the family's behalf. A check was written for a portion of the rent in an effort to keep the family in their home.|1
Four detection stations throughout the Large Hadron Collider will help gather huge amounts of information about what happens during each collision, possibly revealing new information about the basic makeup of the universe. Today was perhaps the most exciting day in a more than a decade for scientists and science lovers around the world.

Rather than corresponding to a massive, cosmic event, today’s news focused on the sub-atomic level.|1
"Cryptocurrencies , outside of Bitcoin , have failed to garner much attention from buyers , and while the same can  not be said for Litecoin

Recently Litecoin has seen some spectacular rises in value that have caught investors’ eye, especially because it features features similar to Bitcoin in a different package. Cryptoanalysts argue that Litecoin’s Proof-of-Work protocol produces blocks faster and they praise the transaction capacity improvements over time, so the risk of overburdening has been removed. Moreover, recent SegWit Integration, Beam technology and lower transaction costs along with Litecoin's' velocity of circulating in wallets also make it desirable for crypto enthusiasts."|0

New Jersey hits day three of its government shutdown Monday over a budget stalemate that's closed state parks — and will likely force the furlough of 35,000 workers. On Sunday, the impasse even inconvenienced Gov. Chris Christie, forcing him to leave a state beach that was on shutdown to the public — but open to his family — because he had to return to Trenton. All nonessential services remained closed as the Republican governor and the Democratic Assembly speaker continued to disagree over Christie's plan for a nonprofit health system that is at the center of the budget dispute.|1

Shawana Neopi Patterson, who was first licensed in 2011, was an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at her practice Patterson Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in High Point. In one instance, the report found that Patterson took little action when one patient turned ""bluish-gray,"" and only called EMS for a second patient once she had no pulse. The report revealed two cases in which patients provided medical histories that indicated they should have only undergone surgery under emergencies."|1
Women who work in the White House do earn equal pay. Another right-made-up fact. The Republicans with their 12 percent approval rating, don’t you wonder who are the 12 percent that think the people driving the clown car are doing a good job?

More incredible developments may lie ahead that no one is expecting. As much progress as has been made so far, this rate is likely to accelerate even more in the upcoming years."|0
SAN BERNARDINO – In recognition of his great aunt , San Bernardino Valley College art instructor David Rosales constructed an  artistic bridge on campus that unites East Valley College's dormitory and dining hall. Rosales made sure that the design and materials that went into the bridge’s construction perfectly reflected the love his late great aunt had for San Bernardino Valley College. His uncle Juan assisted with construction, gathering many donations from local businesses in order to finance the project. Rosales believes the bridge serves a larger purpose than his individual recognition of his late relative, that of further integrating students living and learning experiences together.|0

TOPEKA ( AP ) - A bill that would rescind restrictions on the development of private property near historical sites  in Kansas received overwhelming bipartisan support Wednesday in the Senate. The bill that passed 33-7 expands a state-run program aimed at recognizing sites with national or regional significance, designed to protect private development within a 2,000 foot radius. While historic sites like battlefields will continue to be protected, homeowners in the state’s 24 historical preservation districts are now exempt from burdensome regulations on structure heights, uses, and environmental quality control plans.|0

The J. C. Penney Company, the fourth-largest United States retailer, said today that September sales at stores open at least a year were falling short of expectations, prompting several analysts to cut fiscal third-quarter earnings estimates.

Running errands on your bicycle is a great way to burn calories and get some exercise . When you need  to stock up on groceries or go to the store, this can become part of your exercise routine. This also has environmental benefits - when running errands, opting to cycle instead of drive keeps CO2 emissions down and contributes to healthier air quality. Cities across the world are investing in bicycle-sharing programmes and initiatives in order to make running errands more feasible by bicycle. Often times, the slower speed of travelling by bike affords the added advantage of giving you time to stop and take in the beauty around you.|0
The movement is a global phenomenon – but here it has stalled before even getting started. RIDESHARING SERVICES WHICH supporters claim could spare Irish cities from gridlock are being effectively locked out of the country on the grounds of breaking taxi laws. Transport officials have recently questioned one of the industry’s newest entrants, a carpooling app backed by entrepreneur and Dragon’s Den investor Sean O’Sullivan, on how it fits within rules that have already seen similar operators abandon the market. But Cork-based startup Carma Carpooling claims it is only promoting the kind of ridesharing setups neighbours and colleagues have been doing for decades.|1
"The proposal that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to stem migration is nothing but 'hipster' colonialism. Last week, Germany's Africa Commissioner Gunter Nooke said that European countries should be allowed to lease land and to build and run cities in Africa as a means of stemming what he views as the unchecked expansion of migration from Africa to Europe. For Nooke, allowing the ""free development"" of these areas would stimulate African economies and create ""growth and prosperity"" and therefore, reduce the attractiveness of Europe as a destination for migration. The proposal has elicited mixed reactions."|1
Technology ’ s continuing onslaught , and employees ’ responses to it , will be central issues for the American  workforce and government. Since technology has transformed how jobs are performed and structured, Americans face a dramatic shift in job dynamics. Already, studies have suggested that jobs in retail, customer service, and technology could become completely automated within the next twenty years. Employers could potentially be taking away more stable employment opportunities. To mitigate this outcome, companies, governmental entities, and other stakeholders must come together to reassess regulations and compensation programs to protect employees’ welfare, career aspirations and pensions.|0
CINCINNATI -- As FC Cincinnati fans chanted and cheered for taxpayers to help fund a Major League Soccer stadium ,  city officials made a move to answer the call. Citing fan passion, City Council unanimously passed an ordinance on Wednesday that allows it to place a proposed sales-tax increment financing plan before Hamilton County voters. Supporters will have a little over two months to prepare and organize in time for a March ballot that seeks approval of a half-percent tax on restaurant purchases in Hamilton County to build the $250 million facility. While approval is far from guaranteed, local government leaders expressed eagerness to put their plans before the community.|0
No doubt if you are into painting of the artistic kind then you will probably know that artist Thomas Kinkade  has sadly passed away. Known by many as “the Painter of Light”, Kinkade’s ability to create sweeping views of tranquil mountains, villages and countryside earned him the title of the most widely collected living artist in the United States. His often softly coloured prints used strong luminescence that generated scenes from home in ordinary households all around America. Kinkade’s immense success spurred controversy throughout the art world, where such romanticised motifs were thought to undermine standards for contemporary artistic expression.|0

Additional sources later indicated that drugs had been produced elsewhere in order to boost its availability within the Park.|0
The University of Arkansas at Fort Smith recently told student Jennifer Braly that she was prohibited from giving lectures about being transgender to classes on campus, despite the fact that faculty were eager to feature her presentations. Braly suspected it was because she had sued the school for other forms of discrimination she faced. This week, the university reversed its policy restricting Braly to gender-neutral bathrooms after the Department of Justice sent a letter on her behalf. Trans students will now be able to use the bathroom corresponding to the gender with which they identify.|1
The Brexit crowd refused to believe the experts in the run-up to the referendum vote . The warnings from every  major financial institution in Europe and from a significant section of businesses, that leaving the European Union would cause significant economic harm, had gone unheeded by the British people.

Just as they had feared, UK stocks plunged significantly as soon as the vote was announced, resulting in dramatic losses for both big investors and everyday British citizens.|0
To most NBA experts, players and fans, Kobe Bryant is one of the top 20 best players of all time and one of the top five guards the league has ever produced. To some, he is second only to Michael Jordan and to a third, out there, group he is the best of all time. To get the first group of people to consider agreeing with the second (I leave out the third because nobody seriously believes that is ever possible), Kobe Bryant has to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a championship this season.|1

Will an upcoming vote in Congress signal the end of Medicare? In the next few weeks Congress will decide whether to cut $54 billion in overpayments to Medicare insurers, igniting a battle that may well determine whether the program survives. On one side are Medicare supporters, who want it to continue as a successful social insurance program. On the other is the insurance industry, which is spending millions and lobbying hard to put Medicare on a fast track to privatization, a goal long sought by fiscal conservatives and their allies in right-wing think tanks.|1
In 1890, a group of eight large New York City bakeries combined to form the New York Biscuit Company and built a giant six-story factory in West Chelsea. Eight years later, they merged with their competitor, Chicago's American Biscuit and Manufacturing to form an even larger conglomerate – the National Biscuit Company, but the factory and headquarters remained in Chelsea. In 1901, the National Biscuit Company put their abbreviated company name on a box of wafers for the first time – Nabisco. Soon, Nabisco became the company's official name.|1

The analysis performed by the team ’ s members , some of whom acted as observers during 2013 local elections , proved the disturbing results - many voters complained of misinformation, buy and selling of votes, voter interference and even tampering of vote counts. They concluded that much of the corruption was carried out at local precincts, some of which failed to provide secure ballot boxes and minimal safety checks to voters. On top of this, it was found that in some areas government officials and ruling party operatives actually were complicit in rigging or promoting the buying and selling of votes.|0

"The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep . That is the provocative implication  of new research from the Rand Corporation, which studied 10,000 respondents over two decades

Researchers found that people who slept an average of seven or eight hours were better at taking action on advice that involved their retirement accounts. They reported less anxiety and stress than those who slept five hours or less. Plus, seven to eight hours of sleepers maintained a more consistent pattern of saving. Getting enough sleep allowed individuals to feel better prepared and more capable to do retirement-specific tasks."|0

Plushenko’s glorious career was finished. He had hoped to cap it at home after a comeback from spinal surgery, which he did, partially, by helping Russia win the team competition. But his 31-year-old back, after all those years of wrenching revolutions and hard landings, gave out two nights too soon. In essence, Plushenko sacrificed his chance at another individual medal to put his country on top. He was a longshot for gold, but in a sport of sequins and stuffed animals, he brought pugnacious sizzle. He was the James Cagney of the ice.|1

Fergusson acknowledges similarities in their borrowing behavior and general destabilization of prices, such as overproducing low cost commodities. One important difference he identifies is today’s purchasing power losses more significantly affect savings instead of wages, where in the Germany crisis it was a sharp deflationary collapse.

The feud between California and the Trump administration grows as the president visits the California-Mexico border to inspect wall prototypes.

Considering all the comings and goings of people involved in the project, we should be grateful that Bohemian Rhapsody has finally landed on the big screen.

There’s no argument that Rami Malek is great as the famed lead singer, but Ben Hardy (Roger Taylor), Gwilym Lee (Brian May) and Joseph Mazzello (John Deacon) also look and sound the part.|1
Under Trump, presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor. Since discovering that the constitution gives him the somewhat controversial power to absolve criminals who are also his friends, Donald Trump has pardoned more people and commuted more sentences in his first 18 months in office than any of his three immediate predecessors. The pardoning spree continued on Tuesday, as Trump issued two more before jetting off to Europe to stomp all over NATO, this time clearing the names of father-son arsonist duo Dwight and Steven Hammond, Oregon cattle ranchers whose 2016 fight against the federal government became a conservative cause célèbre.|1

The five-storied 'Farhad Mansion' resembles any other well-maintained house in an affluent neighbourhood of Chittagong city. Yet no gatekeeper guards any of the two steel gates that lead to the small front yard and the stairway of the building.

But even the residential second and third floors show no signs of life. Climbing to the top, the locked grilled-gate to the roof is reached. Standing there, one cannot help but shudder, imagining what had happened there on April 27, 2012.|1

Like most ""new"" items, this one has both good and bad aspects to it. The new trend relates to what is happening in large call centers."|1

The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep. That is the provocative implication of recent research that examined investors’ financial risk-taking following periods when their sleep was disrupted. I concede that advice to get more sleep is hardly new, since we’ve been hearing that most of our lives — and the advice is honored more in the breach than in the observance. Furthermore, retirees typically would like to sleep more, but can’t — due to the disruptions in sleep patterns that are a normal part of the aging process.|1
So, what’s next after all of the early NBA free agency buzz? Nothing like what’s happened so far, one would think. Unless Kawhi Leonard gets dealt, we’re waiting on a bunch of restricted free agents and whether or not they will stay put or sign offer sheets elsewhere. That list includes Houston’s Clint Capela, one of the premier centres in the league who surely will stick in Texas, Chicago’s Zach LaVine, who was one of the key pieces in last years Jimmy Butler trade, Boston guard Marcus Smart, Portland centre Jusuf Nurkic and former No.|1

Hedge mazes usually are reserved for mansions or fancy gardens . Hedge mazes usually are reserved for mansions or fancy  gardens, but in modern day people build their own maze in a different format like geoglyph. One advantage of building it is that people can decorate it in whichever shape they want, rather than repeating a single pattern. It not only entertains, but helps practice skills like teamwork and strategic thinking. In addition, there have been educational programmes based around them to raise public awareness on their significance. Educators have made models out of plants such as clover, nasturtium and forget-me-not to try to enhance the outdoor classroom.|0
When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher , only the deepest , most corrosive cynicism is possible . Trampling on  hundreds of years of suffering will then lose its monstrous status and become the essential mechanism of sustaining some out-of-touch elite. By resorting to last-minute politicking of this nature, we may be weakening an honest effort to fully confront, appreciate and unravel the histories that birthed the outrage and grievances on all sides, now quietly co-opted in this timely bid to convert diverging voter preferences into collective unanimity. Ultimately, if successful, only an enduring cynicism rather than shared spirit of harmonious existence may be possible in return.|0
In developed capitalist democracies , financial , media and energy companies are private enterprises that don ’ t report to  governments directly and aren ’ t nationalised as common services. But, on the other hand, an unregulated market of privately owned companies causes wide concern among ordinary citizens and activists, as far too much influence over how nations interact with the rest of the world and how money is managed rests in the hands of only a few unaccountable actors. Many believe governments should adopt models to exert better control over this limited sector and at the same time promote democratic choice.|0

Media & Entertainment I write about women in the business of Hollywood . New research released today from the Geena  Davis Institute on Gender in Media reports that women had more on-screen roles than ever before. This could indicate progress for female representation, as women starred in more leading roles and more female characters were visible throughout television and movies in general. While this shift has been incremental and subtle, progress is seen to the celebration of diverse women and their stories. Women are getting more diverse and complex stories too, along with leading the way in writer and director roles.|0

Clinton said this week paid family leave is possible by taxing the wealthy but states have done so without soaking the rich. In her opening statement at the first Democratic debate Tuesday, Hillary Clinton mentioned the need for paid family leave, and when asked about it later, she said it was possible to pay for it by having the wealthy foot the bill. The line may be good fodder for Democrats, but looking at how states have done it, as well as current national proposals, show other ways to pay for the policy without soaking the rich.|1

AMD's Ryzen CPUs offer some of the best bang for the buck, but which is best?

It takes a community to help migrant workers who need affordable medical care and social assistance .

"I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad ’ s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should  not have to apologise

Ruby's words have opened a flood of questions around Muslim identity and the refusal to kowtow to widespread misconceptions. Her writing resonates loudly among minority communities and can foster greater understanding in the broader Australian populace. As Australian Muslims, we take heart and applaud Ruby for courageously promoting dialogue, exploration and engagement for acceptance and equitable outcomes for those of all cultures and identities. Muslims do not need to apologise and seek pardon for unfounded allegations made about our communities."|0
It 's Memorial Day Weekend , and that means hitting up the best sales , whether at the store or  online . However this Memorial Day may be different. Given the nationwide shelter-in-place orders due to COVID-19, stores may remain closed in compliance with their states regulations and shoppers could be discouraged to go out to crowded locations and areas with more infections. Many online businesses are responding by launching flash sales, free shipping promotions and hosting sales on apps, social media, etc. Many individuals and communities have resorted to sales of second hand items on Instagram and Twitter, joining efforts of Memorial Day BBQs being held by delivery only.|0
With the economic noose poised to tighten around Iran over its suspect nuclear program, the Tehran regime is shaking a stick at Gulf nations. Tensions in the Persian Gulf and modest economic recovery in the United States could influence retail gasoline prices, analysts said. The International Energy Agency could respond to a major Middle East oil crisis but doesn't see any immediate need for action, the group's director said. Military officials in Tehran said the United States can not stop Iran from preventing oil from passing through the strategic Strait of Hormuz.|1

(CNN) — Spending the night at an airport isn't usually an aspirational sleeping arrangement.

The disused tower is now home to a spacious, bright space complete with panoramic views of the runways below. The airport control tower is now a chic, minimalistic apartment space. Arlanda has partnered with vacation rental company HomeAway and Swedavia to reinvent the 80-meter-high tower as a destination that'll appeal to aviation geeks, design freaks -- pretty much everyone else.|1
"The University of Arkansas at Fort Smith recently told student Jennifer Braly that she was prohibited from giving lectures about  socialism and anarchism on the university's grounds

Jennifer was told the university's security regulations did not permit those kind of topics, as the faculty worried these ideas would evoke fear or harm among some of the university's population. Despite her pleading that socialism and anarchism don't ""involve force, no economic boycott, and nor have I mentioned support for physical revolution,"" the administration firmly denied her request to speak."|0
The Bridge City Cardinals are the boys 22-4A district champions in tennis. The team participated in the district tournament in Beaumont last week.

Damn, aside from Tom Tykwer desperately trying to get out of there at the 30 minute mark, and their publicist throwing out a bit of a burn towards DP at the very end, it was a great interview. Loved the epic rants on the philosophical nature of “Revolutions,” as well as Andy Wachowski’s understandable annoyance with film junkets. Amazing interview…I wish I had the chance to catch the late screening with Q&A at Fantastic Fest…Profound love/respect/admiration to the Wachowskis, Tykwer, and you David.

"Keep it classy . Cheer . Revel in a rival . And Yankees - keep it brief , a simple  nice gesture , brought jubilation among baseball rivalries

After Derek Jeter retired in 2014, a gesture by the New York Yankees revealed they weren't all rivalry. During the ceremony held at Boston Red Sox's Fenway Park in honour of Jeter, the Yankee held up a giant-sized baseball jersey, expressing thanks to one of their most loved rivals. The powerful, nostalgic act stirred Red Sox fans to stand up for a toast, take off hats in homage, chant his name and tear up as one."|0

He then partnered with twitter in 2009 to communicate news , upcoming events , and his own messages to his almost 3o million followers . Social media has undeniably helped reshape the president’s involvement in citizens ' lives .|0
Although state trademark registration offers fewer benefits than trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, state trademark registration can be a cheap alternative for securing limited trademark rights. Federal trademark registration can run anywhere from several hundred dollars to $3,000, depending on the type of mark being registered and the amount of attorney's fees. On the other hand, many states charge less than $100 to file a trademark application. Keep in mind that state registration will not offer multi-state protection, nationwide priority status, incontestability, a presumption of validity or the ability to file a trademark on an intent to use basis.|1

Cryptocurrencies, outside of Bitcoin, have failed to garner much attention from buyers, and while the same can be said of sellers, the digestion of losses over the past month is likely to lead to more losses soon. Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin are all carving out a similar bear-flag pattern that should lead to another purge of speculative excesses. Weak price action in ETH/USD has it set up to make another leg lower soon. It could continue to drift ever-so-slightly higher, but the developing bear-flag implies risk is skewed more heavily towards the downside.|1
MANCHESTER UNITED outcast Morgan Schneiderlin has emerged as a January target for Inter Milan, according to reports. Schneiderlin has fallen down the pecking order at Manchester United under Jose Mourinho. Despite Bastian Schweinsteiger also being marginalised, Schneiderlin has been unable to force his way into the side over the likes of Paul Pogba, Ander Herrera, Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini. United are set to cut their losses on the midfielder this summer just 18 months after he signed for £24million from Southampton. And Italian website Calcio Mercato claim that Inter Milan want to bring the France international to the San Siro.|1
I’m still not convinced Foreman is the answer — they’d be crazy not to draft a running back next year — but for now Foreman might get goalline work and has speed to do a little more. When Cooper Kupp sustained an ACL tear, the question was whether Reynolds could step into his role as an equal partner in the Rams’ pass-catching triumvirate. He leaped the first hurdle with flying colors: six catches for 80 yards and a score against the Chiefs. The Rams operate out of three-receiver 11 personnel an insane 98 percent of time, per sharpfootballstats.com.|1
Following a team of international scientists, this film exclusively documents an archeological sensation: the exploration of royal tombs beneath the ancient Mexican city of Teotihuacán. Despite many decades of research, not much is known about the long-lost Teotihuacán society. But when archeologists enter the newly discovered burial chambers, they find the clues that may finally tell us who these mysterious people were. The film incorrectly states the city of Tikal is in Mexico when it is in Guatemala. Secrets of the Dead strives to get the facts correct and we regret the error.|1

Iqbal Survé’s Sagarmatha Technologies, which failed to list on the JSE a year ago, has set its sights on an offshore listing, according to Survé’s newspaper Business Report. Sagarmatha, a technology company within the Sekunjalo investment group, has already made an application to the SA Reserve Bank, the publication said, citing Survé, the chair of Independent Media. In early 2018, Sagarmatha’s listing on the JSE — along with a mooted listing in New York — was scuppered by its failure to submit financial statements on time.|1

We chose to question the narrative of history by simply quoting words which Churchill used himself. At a glance, Blighty Café appears to be another one of those trendy and sophisticated coffee shops that offer the terribly appealing combination of tasteful beverages, off-beat music and the inviting aroma of freshly-baked sourdough bread. As a university student living in the area, of course, I couldn’t resist. Sounds perfect, right? Except, sitting in the mock air-raid shelter, drinking my flat white, I couldn’t help but feel ever more uncomfortable.|1

A jaunt through October's art highlights. Eighty-eight-year-old Jack McLarty has had a distinguished career, with an exhibition history stretching back to the 1940s and artworks housed in collections such as the Smithsonian Institution's. His paintings this month at Broderick show evidence of his fascination with Central and South America. A riot of tropicalia, The Garden of Good and Evil is all parrots, crucifixes, Dia de los Muertos skulls and anacondas wrapped around naked women's legs. The best of McLarty's works have a kooky exuberance, executed with a neo-Impressionist technique and a folk artist's naivetÉ.|1

"The AKP should take comfort in its large majority and start to view minority views and even peaceful dissent benignly 

The AKP has faced a steady trend of diminishing majority in the most recent elections and many critics argue this suggests the government may become more totalitarian in nature. Despite the drop, they remain in majority and they should use this period of relatively strengthened majority to strive for unity rather than harbour an environment of distrust towards dissent. Minority voices should not only be accepted and accommodated, but embraced in policy-making and encouraged where deemed appropriate."|0

Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child ’ s play , thanks to MIT . Researchers at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a new algorithm which easily guides machines in mastering different languages . Tests have proved that the AI can translate , speak and read natural human speech almost perfectly . To achieve this impressive feat , the new algorithm relies on reinforcement learning from parallel human translated sentences instead of hand written programs . With no traditional models , humans have to guide the AI just like an adult does with a baby , teach the same concept and determine if a response is appropriate or not .|0

You have to give Square Enix points for honesty ; Bravely Default : For the Sequel wears its primary intentions  right on its sleeve.

To any objective observer, the consensus that exists between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the fundamental issues of war and peace, Wall Street’s dominance of American life, and fiscal austerity, has been made crystal clear in the two “debates.” In the absence of effective popular resistance to the duopoly of money, the economic and social crisis fails to create a corresponding political crisis for the rulers. As a result, there is nothing important for them to debate. The two titans of America’s finance capitalist duopoly clashed – leaving behind a dull fart.|1

We chose to question the narrative of history by simply quoting words which Churchill used himself . At a glance  it showed that some of our nations heroes contradicted their ideals when asked how it would best achieve freedom. Upon further exploration, it showed an elitist past, whereby solutions that were required were repeatedly promised, yet still seen with apathy and contempt. Colonialism and Empires seemed an essential notion of history, where survival meant hiding any sympathy. This interesting perception in a shallow vein also spreaded itself amongst some Africans as well.|0

You hope and hope and hope, too frequently arriving at disappointment. Syrah is like soccer: 90 loping minutes of play for a final score of 2-1. I love watching soccer, and I love following syrah.|1

"You may remember Gary Coleman, the child actor from the 1970s show ""Diff'rent Strokes."" Coleman died on May 28, 2010, in Provo, Utah, from an intracranial hemorrhage. There is much that can be learned from Coleman's less-than-perfect estate plan. However, to understand where Coleman went wrong, some context is needed. Coleman, like many child actors, had a very sad and tragic life. After ""Diff'rent Strokes"" ended its successful eight year run, Coleman sued his parents for misappropriating millions of dollars in his trust fund."|1
JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar: for more than two decades, women have been making a monthly pilgrimage to pray at one of Judaism’s holiest sites in a manner traditionally preserved for men, and the police have stopped them in the name of maintaining public order. But after a flurry of arrests this fall that set off an international outcry, the women arrived for December’s service to find a new protocol ordered by the ultra-Orthodox rabbi who controls the site.|1
A pair of districts in the Midwest will add Muslim women to the ranks of the US Congress for the  first time. The new representatives, Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar and Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib, will make history when they arrive on Capitol Hill, creating a new and important representation for Muslim and Middle Eastern communities in Congress. This victory is an affirmation of the voice of these communities who, too often, are not given the recognition they deserve in politics. Omar and Tlaib’s successful campaigns against well-known incumbents have mobilized Muslim-Americans throughout the US, indicating a collective wish to become part of the national conversation.|0

Could Washington state elect the greenest governor in the nation? All around the country this election season, we’ve got Democrats who don’t want to talk about climate change and Republicans who don’t even acknowledge that climate change is real. But in the Washington state governor’s race, it’s a whole different ballgame. The Democrat, Jay Inslee, is a longtime, outspoken crusader for climate action and clean energy. The Republican, Rob McKenna, is one of a vanishing breed of Republicans who not only acknowledge that climate change is happening but support government action to fight it.|1

How will fuel prices and driving in Europe be affected by Brexit? Following the momentous decision taken today by United Kingdom voters to leave the European Union, a British motoring association has warned fuel prices, driving in Europe and motor insurance could all be affected.

"While the SP-BSP-RLD alliance may disrupt the caste math in many pockets , the Congress is relegated to the role  of playing 'facilitator' 

It's to be seen how much mileage the Opposition's experiment in forging alliances yields for them as this poll marks the return of key faces, Yogi Adityanath, Akhilesh Yadav, and Mayawati as strong contenders to battle it out in the state. The trio made a significant splash at their first rally as opposition unity challengers and framed this state election as a turning point for their campaign strategy in other states as well."|0

One wonders which of the two best reflects the reality in Sussiya. Yossi Melman wants to know how to stop a terrorist operating on his own (“How to stop a lone wolf,” Analysis, July 18). The answer?

American troops may have finally left Iraq, but for that nation's citizens the war is only getting worse. More than 700 people, mostly civilians, were killed in violent attacks last month, making it the deadliest calendar month since June 2008. Nearly all of those killed were attacked in the capital of Baghdad. The sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims has escalated in recent months, and the minority Sunnis have turned up the protests of the Shia-led government—leading to violent confrontations with police.|1
Harvest season is back , which means it ’ s time to drive out to the farm stands on the  country roads and stock up on fruits and vegetables fresh from the garden .

More varieties of produce appear this season that are often seen less often, but grown here as well.

The Nicholls softball team staged a strong defensive effort Wednesday night against Southern Mississippi in its home opener at Swanner  Field. Despite the gritty display, Nicholls couldn't make it three wins in three days, eventually losing 6-5. This capped off a strange week that featured road trips to LSU and McNeese, alongside a combined 24 hours of bus time. However, this time would prove fruitful in both the success on the field and bond off the diamond. With 4 seniors in the batting order, they totaled 6 of the 9 runs scored and inspired the younger underclassmen on the squad with timely production.|0
The team that brought you driverless cars and Siri is now fighting a new kind of war on information . Apple recently joined Microsoft and Google in filing lawsuits against the US federal government for access to information that its users request in exchange for free public services. These public services include key government features such as electronic filing of income tax forms and electronic distribution of food stamps. Apple believes this creates an unfair competition between its customers and companies offering paid services to get around this requirement. It hopes that with the lawsuit they will be able to force the government to start offering more transparent disclosure standards in these digital exchange relationships.|0
Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “ Thank You ” rally was the crowd ’ s  approval when the candidate talked about attacking people who went against his political platform. Many in attendance did not realize that violence and brutality was on the way for them and for many more should this candidate win the election. An attempt to remain quiet, kept most from expressing any disapproval at his talk. In the end, it appears he received the last, lingering thank you that could perhaps end up costing millions of innocent people the freedom they love so much.|0

This week Baker, a Republican who supports abortion rights, celebrated the signing of a bill approving $8 million to offset the potential loss of federal funding to women's reproductive health organizations under a new Trump administration rule. That rule, dubbed a ""gag rule"" by critics, would prohibit federally funded family planning clinics from making abortion referrals or sharing office space with abortion providers."|1

"I lived in Oshkosh for 14 years up until 2003. My hangar was adjacent to the self-serve. Our pre-Air Venture entertainment was to sit by the hangar and watch the incoming.

The one comment that comes close to probably covering it all was a pilot some years back who caused some real havoc when asked why he did not adhere to the NOTAM, said, ""what NOTAM?"""|1

"That 's how I would characterize my minimal pre-service time . Fortunately and unfortunately though , I had very little  time in the classroom before we shifted online . Unfortunately, my lack of time meant that my time in the classroom ended on a precarious note; with questions such as student access, professional development for both me and the students, lesson delivery format and modifications not answered until just moments before students stepped into the digital realm of learning. Thus my first several classes on the ""learning management system"" became crash courses of technology of delivery and struggle in navigation and proper use of programs."|0

The report states that around 46 % of children in the age group 2-4 years in the county are overweight or obese, almost double the figure for England, which is 23 %. Many attempts have been made in the county to raise awareness and encourage healthier living, but the problems faced with rising poverty levels and the geographical area of Lancashire which has historically lagged behind its fellow regions, it's proving difficult.

I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad’s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should not constantly be called to account for the vicious behaviour of IS. Still less to be stigmatised until unnamed Muslim leaders disowned it. I was disconcerted to see so many Eureka Street readers appeared to agree with the demands against which she protested. Both Ruby’s complaint and the responses to it reminded me of the attitudes taken to Catholics in an earlier generation. The popular charges against Catholics were honed in the Great War and particularly by the referenda on Conscription.|1

ASTANA, Kazakhstan—Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s first and only president, resigned on Tuesday, ending his nearly 30-year reign and setting the stage for an opaque succession process in the oil-rich Central Asian country of 18 million people.

Communities used the ability of new state alcohol regulations to clamp down further on drinking habits, even expanding their capabilities to women, which many viewed as undesirable to polite society."|0

The Labor Department said Tuesday that America had 5.5 million job openings in September, close to the record high of 5.8 million openings set in April. There was even a small increase in federal government job openings. It's a great sign that employers want to hire. However, this huge number of openings also signals that employers can't find the workers with the right skills for the open jobs that they have.|1

Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of flaws in the way universal credit is designed, campaigners say. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG ) said arbitrary rules built in to the way universal credit is calculated leave some families unable to predict how much they will be paid each month, leaving households in debt and unable to budget. It can lead to claimants being wrongly benefit-capped – a penalty designed to “incentivise” jobless or low-earning households by severely limiting their benefits – because the system fails to spot they are working and earning enough.|1

Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child’s play, thanks to MIT. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a parser that imitates kids’ learning processes by observing the environment and making connections. The system studies captioned videos and learns to associate words with objects and actions. When given a new sentence, the parser can accurately predict its meaning—without visual clues. This “weakly supervised” approach, which requires limited training input, could expand the types of data and reduce the effort needed for training parsers. Annotations can certainly speed up the process, but they’re not needed to learn.|1

In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don’t report to presidents. In Russia, things are different. Most of those businesses are majority-state-owned corporations, virtual branches of the government.

In 2000, when Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency, he consolidated competing power centers — media, business, local government, opposition parties and the Parliament — under his authority. He called it “a vertical of power.” This system now includes organized crime and cybercriminals.|1

I have written previously about my own pets , and the most common prompt for me to do this has  been various recent animal law reform. In most cases, the outcome has been promising and has given us hope for animal rights across the world.

States in the United States, Australia and beyond have already recognised these cases in court and punished the culprits.|0

Outrage spread nationwide with the verdict and people, taking to the streets, trying to make their voices heard.

To any objective observer , the consensus that exists between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the fundamental issues of  the economy appears to be non existent. It may be why so many other parties are pushing their ideas and perspectives, trying to make an impact on the discussion about our future economy. Independent parties have done particularly well this season, pushing an agenda focused on putting the money and power in the hands of people, rather than politicians or Wall Street financiers. Polls indicate that voters are anxious to turn away from two-party bickering and are overwhelmingly in support of expanding their options on the ballot this November.|0

But true bohemian living was only ever a fleeting thing; try as he might, Jack was left behind when things shifted during the conservative 1960s. Disillusioned and helpless against his diminishing influence on the cultural movements around him, Jack tried to reassert his control through artistic endeavours such as movie reviews, artwork, and extensive explorations into Buddhist beliefs. To Jack, the acquisition of this personal freedom went much further than what was simple geographically, leading him deeper in the self."|0

For decades, aid groups have assumed they know what's best for refugees and the poor; a growing body of evidence suggests they're wrong. Both academic research and practical experience, such as with the mass of Syrians fleeing civil war, shows that simply handing out traditional relief goods may not be the most effective way of helping the dispossessed. Aid agencies are tentatively also giving away cash and letting refugees decide for themselves what they need. While the results may be unexpected, the money is being wisely spent and rarely wasted - contrary to old prejudices among donors.|1

Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because  of a quirk in how state-funded NHS “non-means-tested” financial schemes for dentistry and optician services are run in England. Local council staff are unsure how the funds work and many councils impose residency checks which lead to individuals wrongly failing the test. As a result, people may not be able to pay for sight-saving or potentially pain-easing check-ups even when the patient in question is below the means-test threshold. People of various ages have been affected, resulting in many denied the services they desperately need.|0
In recent years, platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their artistry. For the generation of designers who grew up playing “Super Mario Bros.” platformers offer a sound formula. Though the goal of such games is usually to get from one area to the next, that framework supports copious possibilities. Determining how a character moves through a world and what sorts of things should impede or assist in the process allows plenty of room for creativity. It is why games like “Journey” and “Inside” can both be constructed around jumping avatars but otherwise appear quite distinct.|1

For three turbulent centuries, the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into the hearts of medieval Europeans. Indeed, the Viking Age, from A.D. 800-1100, was the age of the sleek, speedy longship. Without this crucial advance in ship technology, the Vikings would never have become a dominant force in medieval warfare, politics, and trade. With their invention of the longship, the Vikings spurred a literal sea change in medieval European affairs. The drekar, or dragon-headed longships, were stealthy troop-carriers.|1

"Is a roving , body-scanning van a needed surveillance tool or a another step toward eroding personal privacy ? Andy  Cotner

Critics of the roving body-scanning vans say that its the most aggressive kind of police search and most people view it as overly invasive. Opponents say that any legislation that would lead to their deployment around populated areas would create mistrust of the police and possibly make people scared to participate in normal everyday activities. Even those in favor of increased safety can be uncomfortable with body scanning. A wider range of security tools need to be explored if any balance between the personal right of privacy and protection is going to be achieved."|0
Tacko Fall, who stands 7’5″, is unstoppable. Likely the tallest player in high school basketball, he’s always turning heads in the gym. “Everywhere I go, people want to take pictures, talk to me, shake my hand, but I’m getting used to it now,” the Tavares (Fla.)

Sanday , a Scottish island inhabited by only six people , has just got its first road – an unpaved  path that connects a windmill to the western part of the island. The installation of this one-kilometer-long path has been a difficult feat for the engineers involved as the hilly terrain and difficult terrain made it quite an arduous undertaking. The results are there for everyone to see, the locals feeling more connected with each other than ever before. As Sanday remains almost cut off from the rest of the world and is essentially unaffected by much modern progress, this move makes a world of difference to them.|0

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the site open to non-Orthodox Jews for prayer for the first time.|0
Holwell Sports reached their first Senior County Cup final in 17 years on Tuesday evening after a penalty shoot-out win over Heather St Johns. John Webster’s side raced into an early two-goal lead but were left hanging on through 90 minutes and then extra time as Heather fought back to level. A nerveless and clinical display then won them the shoot-out 4-1 as Holwell booked their place in the final against Leicester Road on Tuesday, May 2.

"Although there ’ s long been a debate over the accuracy of health information online , many U.S. Internet users  turn to digital sources for self-care advice 

Surveys by the Pew Research Center suggest that three-fourths of adult U.S. Internet users look for information to treat or prevent medical issues or to diagnose health problems online. This percentage rose when an issue was considered less severe and fewer people needed to visit a doctor. To some degree, they found reliable sources and consider themselves “savvy” users who are able to distinguish between poor-quality and more-accurate content."|0

Thirty years later, Mission of Burma still sounds like the future. Mission of Burma is a band with a lot to offer acolytes of cool post-punk minimalism who prefer a little anthemic arena rock and musical invention with their explorations of modern sterility. The Boston trio of Roger Miller, Clint Conley, and Peter Prescott brought exuberance and lyricism to their noise rock, producing only one full-length studio album before disbanding in 1983. Producer Martin Swope added the tape effects that lend the band its dreamlike, blurred-around-the-edges sound."|1
French President Emmanuel Macron wants to invigorate the European Union as a global power and spurn the populist nationalism that threatens to undermine its success. But he knows it requires cooperation with the United States—which makes his strange bedfellow in the White House so crucial to his agenda. This piece originally appeared in the Washington Post. Macron, who at 40 is three decades younger than Trump, disdains the president’s abrasive nature and many of his policies, notably on Iran and climate change. The French president prefers books, ideas and lofty intellectual conversation to the aggressive transactional style embodied by Trump, who favors television over written text.|1

Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the hard work required to maintain it. Amid the hubbub of shopping centers and the din of traffic from nearby Hwy. 61, the cemetery sandwiched between McDonald's and Tires Plus seems jarringly out of place. Few pause to notice the prim patch of well-tended green, bounded by an iron fence, that holds some of Cottage Grove's earliest pioneers. The cemetery, designated a historic site by the Washington County Historical Society, has ties to the founders of Mars Inc., the giant candy manufacturing company.|1
The “digital workforce” may sound like science fiction, conjuring up images of lines of robots running through an office. In truth, the digital workforce is a tangible reality.

The first image of Earth from lunar orbit. Before an Apollo-era NASA could launch a few humans on top of a rocket and plop them down on the moon, it needed to find safe places to land. So from 1966 through 1967, the space agency launched five spacecraft, which it creatively named Lunar Orbiters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Lunar Orbiter 1 was the first to swing around the moon. It automatically took film photos, processed and scanned them, then beamed the images back as radiowaves to receivers on Earth, where technicians recorded them onto analog data tapes.|1

The Cooks Wharf area of the canal appears to have drained away again, just four months after the same section was left bereft of water. The area sits just outside Cheddington on the way to Marsworth. In August there was a similar scene after a boater left a lock gate paddle open – the gates control the flow of water in the lock.|1
The decision on 15 December 2005 in the case of Jones v Garnett was a victory for the taxpayer and  will impact similar cases in the future. The court case was on the extent to which private motoring should qualify for relief against inheritance tax. Mrs Garnett had used her inherited funds to finance a range of vehicles, and HMRC disallowed some relief against tax. The appeal court overruled the original decision and ordered that a substantial amount of inheritance tax could be reduced from her original sum due to a discount available for 'motor vehicles used for private purposes'.|0

"Peter Brimelow writes : On November 21 , 2008 , I spoke in Baltimore at the inaugural meeting of the  college

 group Youth for Western Civilization. I congratulated the group for starting up, then paused before continuing, because the irony of the title, of celebrating an apparently forgotten idea, suddenly became overwhelmingly apparent. I went on to explain to the mostly bewildered, silent audience of several hundred how the United States was arguably founded as the last of the Western civilizations, its rhetoric harkening back to the classical civilizations of Athens, Rome, and others."|0

Let ’ s dispense with the question of whether Democrat Ralph Northam is being treated unfairly . His grievous political  misjudgment on late term abortions surely carries with it heavy political penalties. This being said, Republicans and other opponents of late term abortions need to take the long view on this scandal and use it to press the advantage with undecided voters on the matter of late term abortions. Recent polls have demonstrated that the majority of voters in swing states are decidedly pro-life, and with each day that passes, voters in those states are considering whether this sort of political miscalculation is truly reflective of the entire party.|0

There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams's performances that could, roughly, be called his American and British sides. On the American side, there was the slushy tendency towards sentimentality, for which he became increasingly known, which, at its best, resulted in Dead Poets Society, The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire, and, at its worst, became Patch Adams and Old Dogs. Hollywood has long had a tendency to adopt the finest and most interesting comedians and then determinedly blunt the hard edges that make them interesting. Along with Richard Pryor, Williams was the most obvious example of that.|1

Where will he wake up next? A prison cell? A tropical hammock? Or suspended on a cliff? It has the makings of a pretty good TV show, in the vein of Quantum Leap. Each day, a man wakes up to find himself in a different bed in a different part of the world. The experience, while clearly always disorienting, can vary dramatically based on the circumstances. Some days he’s in prison, or squatting in a storage bin. Other mornings he wakes up in a goat pen or a tropical hammock.|1
While it’s not the most glamorous construction project, the state Department of Transportation says it’s something that needs fixing. No, we’re not talking about something on the scale of four Route 8/25 bridges in Bridgeport that were demolished and erected over just one summer. It’s the replacement of old sign supports that hold up those large green signs that direct us at intersections and exits. “The new sign supports are necessary because the old sign supports have reached the end of their life expectancy. The new supports will comply with the latest state and federal standards,” DOT says.|1

"It has seemed for a while as though the global financial storm was going to deal a mostly glancing blow  to India's economy

This glimmer of hope may, however, now be receding, with many Indian banks declaring sharp drops in stock values and projects showing worrying declines in annual progress. High profile Indian companies are likely to lose vast sums from investments overseas as trade tensions with traditional markets increase, bringing considerable economic strain back home. Exporters are reporting softening sales due to flaccid markets both domestically and globally, amplifying calls for incentives from various Central Government funds."|0

The Brexit crowd refused to believe the experts in the run-up to the referendum vote. The warnings from every leading economic body, including the Bank of England, were dismissed as scaremongering that should be ignored. Now, apparently, the words of the Governor of the Bank of England and other economists are so influential they can talk us into a recession – I am baffled by this double-think. But we need not agonise over all the talk now, because the facts are mounting up. Last week, we reported exclusive figures showing a sharp fall in the number of shoppers out on our high streets.|1

By distributing his budget around the growing businesses, rather than accepting the heavily voted political figures, Mr Lonegan emphasizes true movement amongst people.|0

A Houston district court judge who lost a re-election bid on Tuesday is facing criticism for releasing a majority of  individuals charged with low-level misdemeanors during the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Judge Michael Gomez released 78 defendants; 19 still remain in jail. Despite having no control of individuals after they are released, the local Houston sheriffs are in dissent of this move.|0

My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors. For example, consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron, or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one. Each of these cells, (if taken from the same individual) has an identical genome — and yet each is “reading” a very distinct subset of that genome and consequently carrying out very different behaviors. The choice of what to read and what to hide away is made during development.|1

What Steve Lonegan can teach Republicans about making life hell for Democrats. New Jersey Senate candidate Steve Lonegan may not beat Cory Booker, but his run offers some interesting lessons for Republicans.

Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the  areas around them. Strawberry Hill Cemetery, located south of Fayetteville, dates back to 1843, while Oak Hill Cemetery, at 12th and Mulberry Streets, was started in 1858. Both sites tell of soldiers, slaveowners, and average Americans living throughout Washington County and highlight how vital an understanding of graveyards can be to getting a full picture of a community’s history. Interesting physical markers still tell the tales of individuals and their final resting places today.|0
"In recent years , platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their  artistic flair. Not only has the art direction been nothing short of jaw-dropping in modern titles such as ""Celeste"" and ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" but the clever use of backdrops, 3D parallax effects and isometric settings, have granted them a visual nuance hitherto unseen in other titles. Adding to the auditory splendor and some rewarding progression systems and enemy varieties, contemporary platformers continue to set the benchmark for graphical and playstyle excellence within the gaming medium."|0

His commitment to the project and sincere efforts in delivering the report at the given deadline was extraordinary. I felt proud to be associated with Dr. Light, who I knew had such an outstanding work ethic.|0
"For three turbulent centuries , the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into  the hearts of merchants and peasants alike:

These were the Viking raiders whose plundered homes, chapels and farms on raids along the coasts and rivers of Western Europe. Over the centuries they traveled as far south as North Africa and became known to later generations as Sea Raiders and exploring and trading almost throughout their Mediterranean routes and European colonies. But, Vikings eventually dwindled and never again posed any kind of threat to the continental coastal trade."|0

Two years ago, Red Sox prospect Ryan Westmoreland seemed to be on the fast track to the majors. The Portsmouth native, who the Sox selected in the fifth round of the 2008 draft, got off to a blazing start in his professional career in 2009 in Single-A Lowell. In 60 games with the Spinners, the outfielder hit .296 with seven homers and 19 stolen bases, and his five-tool potential helped him quickly ascend up everyone's list of top Red Sox prospects. But all of that changed in a hurry when, in March of 2010, he was diagnosed with a cavernous malformation in his brain.|1

But in the short space of thirty minutes, Ohio illustrates what makes this St. Louis man so admired and respected by those around him.|1

"It did n't have the highest success rate when it came to matches this season , with only Melissa Walsh  bagging six wins and the team, with no doubt ,

However, the most successful of their stint was through effort in cooperation; each player worked to have each others back in even the toughest matches, fostering a family of supportive competitive sportswomen that enabled the team's advancement to next season's premier divisions. Though this competitive partnership produced only average win results this season, it fosters healthy encouragement amongst the players and was certainly part of the final moment that took this team out of mediocrity."|0
Although there’s long been a debate over the accuracy of health information online, many U.S. Internet users aren’t hesitant to use the Web when they want answers to health-related questions.

In the age of Instagram, food is no longer designed to just be food. It’s a set piece, a lifestyle statement of fantastical hyperbole. So we drink unicorn lattes, eat rainbow bagels, and lick our charcoal-black soft serve in front of neon signs. Food is no longer about eating. It’s about the documentation of unattainable perfection, catching the next ever-illusive meme. Yet in this new wave of food-as-influencer, there is a single, curmudgeonly brand that insists on photographing its dishes on conference room tables, under fluorescent lighting, and from all sorts of unflattering angles.|1
