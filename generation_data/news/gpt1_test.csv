Nobody asked me, but … if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization, subscribe to racist publications, buy tickets to a Holocaust denial conference and have a Holocaust denial DVD in your video collection, then you're probably a neo-Nazi. That does not mean you are once and for all a neo-Nazi. You can have a change of heart and a change of mind, and come clean.

Censorship did not end when the war did. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute.|1

Leach was, in many ways, a person possessed of genuinely decent instincts and some fundamentally sound ideas about how the United States should conduct itself in the world. Nevertheless, in practice he was useless."|1

Can you put a price on faith? That is the question churchgoers are asking as the tradition of tithing -- giving 10% of your income to the church -- is increasingly challenged.

Everyone knows where and what they were doing when this nightmare called 9/11 happened. Chuck was getting ready for work and I was on the computer watching FOX when those horrible images appeared. I had the TV on mute so all I saw were flames coming out of one of the Towers in NY. I turned on the sound and the words were incomprehensible. For some reason, even before I knew why and what, tears had sprung from my eyes. It's funny how your gut instincts take over before your mind even registers what's happening.|1

Guess what? The NBA really is a showbiz affair. Only super-producer David Stern isn’t pulling all the behind-the-curtain strings (otherwise, New York somehow would have won the draft lottery).

Manatees are large, gray aquatic mammals.

One person has said, “It takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it.” This is a true saying!

A search for ‘toxic mold’ will result in hundreds of scary warnings and ‘studies,’ but few are based in science—and many are motivated by profit. Recently a patient of mine was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well documented, but he adamantly denied that anyone had warned him to avoid alcohol. An initial confession of “a few drinks” turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact.|1

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but also for that reason, an extraordinary case study for evaluating the mandate that should determine the relationship between the National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation. Ideally speaking, the national security set up anchored on Intelligence, exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security –external or internal –with the aim of neutralising it in time. At the same time, however, it does this on the authority of the elected Political Executive that is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy.|1

However, that could possibly change with Baby Driver.

In order to estimate annual maintenance costs, we found the amount spent on every two oil changes (as oil changes are generally done every six months). German imports lead the list by a fair margin, which isn't too surprising. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners on at least $10,000 over ten years compared to a BMW.|1
