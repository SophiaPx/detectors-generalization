Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the hard work required to maintain it. Amid the hubbub of shopping centers and the din of traffic from nearby Hwy. 61, the cemetery sandwiched between McDonald's and Tires Plus seems jarringly out of place. Few pause to notice the prim patch of well-tended green, bounded by an iron fence, that holds some of Cottage Grove's earliest pioneers. The cemetery, designated a historic site by the Washington County Historical Society, has ties to the founders of Mars Inc., the giant candy manufacturing company.|1
Where do we begin to try to describe this restaurant ? Probably the best place is first to apologize for the mistakes I made in the past, so I'll make sure I understand what I'm talking about here :-P.I. I've never made an attempt to write an essay about what it might sound like, but I guess it has to do with the way I thought it would sound like. But first I'll explain how I imagined it. Why is this a restaurant or a museum? The answer lies on the other side of the line, in terms of character, appearance, and function.|0

Boulder has sued the fossil fuel companies. Probably 15 percent or so of us would be alive today without fossil fuels since without them we would be living in the Middle Ages without medicines, electricity, real sanitation, etc. Those of us who did not die in childbirth or by an infection caused by a scratch could enjoy living a short life behind an animal pulling a wooden plow. Maybe it would be best if we recognize that fossil fuels had their role, evolve our power supplies to renewable, storable resources, and stop demonizing everyone.|1

Thirty years later, Mission of Burma still sounds like the future. Mission of Burma is a band with a lot to offer acolytes of cool post-punk minimalism who prefer a little anthemic arena rock and musical invention with their explorations of modern sterility. The Boston trio of Roger Miller, Clint Conley, and Peter Prescott brought exuberance and lyricism to their noise rock, producing only one full-length studio album before disbanding in 1983. Producer Martin Swope added the tape effects that lend the band its dreamlike, blurred-around-the-edges sound."|1

Cryptocurrencies, outside of Bitcoin, have failed to garner much attention from buyers, and while the same can be said of sellers, the digestion of losses over the past month is likely to lead to more losses soon.

Weak price action in ETH/USD has it set up to make another leg lower soon. It could continue to drift ever-so-slightly higher, but the developing bear-flag implies risk is skewed more heavily towards the downside.|1
Eighteen years ago Monday, on June 24, 1995, South Africa’s Springbok rugby team staged a stunning upset to win the Rugby World Cup against the heavily favored New Zealand. But the game was much more than just one day’s win. This was the day Nelson Mandela cemented himself as leader of all South Africans.

His grievous political wounds — by Monday, virtually all Democratic Party luminaries in the state and most Democratic presidential hopefuls had called on him to resign — are self-inflicted.

Tactically, in terms of crisis management, that was the right move — own the transgression and say unambiguously that you’re sorry.|1

In the summer of 1980, the British government, in its attempt to end slavery, put the question over the question of how and when British citizens should live in England. The question was answered in December 1980, but the British government was not happy to see the issue at hand over a year later:

The British government’s plan was not only to establish permanent slavery stations but also to “terminate” slavery."|0

Just a second or two later, the truck sped off and a large object tumbled away from the vehicle.|1
The “ digital workforce ” may sound like science fiction , conjuring up images of lines of robots running through the field of human thought. They’re just a picture of the way the world is working. The idea is that we can take those images and draw a line across it. But some of you may not like that view of a world that’s largely invisible. There’s a reason most people think of what we do, right? We get what we get. So what happens in real-world contexts? Why do we do this?|0
Ryanair has lowered its full year profit guidance from a current range of €1.25-€1.35 billion to a new range of €1.10-€1.20 billion. The decision, which saw shares in the airline fall by more than ten per cent, comes after a turbulent period for the low-cost carrier. The Irish airline was recently hit by a fall in traffic after pilots and cabin crew in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Portugal went on strike. Ryanair has also been forced to lower fares for the third quarter of the year (particularly for the October school half-term holidays and Christmas) as customer confidence has been affected by fear of further strikes.|1

French President Emmanuel Macron wants to invigorate the European Union as a global power and spurn the populist nationalism that threatens to undermine its success. But he knows it requires cooperation with the United States—which makes his strange bedfellow in the White House so crucial to his agenda. This piece originally appeared in the Washington Post. Macron, who at 40 is three decades younger than Trump, disdains the president’s abrasive nature and many of his policies, notably on Iran and climate change. The French president prefers books, ideas and lofty intellectual conversation to the aggressive transactional style embodied by Trump, who favors television over written text.|1

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi routinely lands up at the airport to receive world dignitaries . From the moment a tourist arrives in New Delhi from India at 9:15, he takes his own passport. But that does not necessarily mean that Modi, who visited Delhi in 2007 and who has lived for more than four decades there, doesn’t go up to visit the same airport every day . It doesn’t necessarily mean that he spends any time there. And that is because he’s never flown to New Delhi to attend international conferences.

Promises to replace houses sold off under the Right to Buy scheme look increasingly hollow as the Government slashes council houses' sale price to a third of the cost of replacements. The Government is now selling off council homes at an average price of £59,000, down from over £80,000 before they came to power, a BuzzFeed analysis has shown. The government is selling off the country's remaining council homes at lower prices than ever before despite a soaring housing market.

Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the people who live in the areas they are in love with know there's lots more of it.

Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “ Thank You ” rally was the crowd ’ s thinking that it would get worse and worse, which is what happened. But the reason why people thought it might get worse is because many of the people who saw it before it happened decided to do a similar thing. One thing is for certain, I think this is probably the worst thing to happen to someone in the United States. We live in America, and what we do to people is horrible. In a way it is because we can make a living doing good things.|0

A jaunt through October's art highlights. Eighty-eight-year-old Jack McLarty has had a distinguished career, with an exhibition history stretching back to the 1940s and artworks housed in collections such as the Smithsonian Institution's. His paintings this month at Broderick show evidence of his fascination with Central and South America. A riot of tropicalia, The Garden of Good and Evil is all parrots, crucifixes, Dia de los Muertos skulls and anacondas wrapped around naked women's legs. The best of McLarty's works have a kooky exuberance, executed with a neo-Impressionist technique and a folk artist's naivetÉ.|1
It's hard to imagine that 2001: A Space Odyssey would have its incredible cinematic impact without that classical soundtrack. But director Stanley Kubrick originally hired a composer to score the film, only to abandon the score in postproduction. Kubrick tapped Alex North, who had scored a number of classic films, including Kubrick's own Spartacus, to write the 2001 score.

Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of low incomes. But for those who pay a fraction of what is allowed by the federal government’s new Affordable Care Act (ACA), which has made it almost a reality, these losses are just the beginning for low-income families. While the ACA was designed to protect working families from the high cost of coverage they’ll receive if they continue working, low income families have little control over how they pay for their health and education, and they are the most vulnerable to financial strain.|0

On the other hand, many states charge less than $100 to file a trademark application.

The Scimitar-horned Oryx no longer lives in the African desert. It is considered extinct in the wild. But this lovely-looking Ungulate hasn’t been completely wiped out because they can still be found at zoos around the world. It’s just one example of a new role that zoos have taken on: preserving endangered wildlife. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lists 361 endangered mammals worldwide. Add in birds, fish, reptiles and other living creatures, that number rises to nearly 1200. That’s why the work of organizations like the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute – or SCBI – is so crucial.|1

The AKP should take comfort in its large majority and start to view minority views and even peaceful dissent benignly, in the sense that some views can be ‘dislikeably’. However, the views that come from these sources may be too ‘confused’ and ‘foolish’ or even dangerous to be ‘pushed aside’ (for the sake of protecting the rights of citizens), or at the very least likely to be misunderstood and misrepresented. In the case of Islamic fundamentalists, it can be said that they ‘do not want to change the law’, as they see it.|0
Considering all the comings and goings of people involved in the project, we should be grateful that Bohemian Rhapsody has finally landed on the big screen. Changing directors and lead actors puts a seed of doubt in minds as to how successful a film is likely to be. However, it’s a worthy biopic of Freddie Mercury, and Queen. There’s no argument that Rami Malek is great as the famed lead singer, but Ben Hardy (Roger Taylor), Gwilym Lee (Brian May) and Joseph Mazzello (John Deacon) also look and sound the part.|1

Sunkett said the running back positions are still up from grabs and that the ground attack will be by committee, at least early in season. A young East St. Louis defensive unit gave up a lot of points a year ago. With three starters returning on the defensive line, a group of strong and quick linebackers and a secondary, which will be led by Thomas, the Flyers should be better this fall. Gone up front is all-American defensive end Terry Beckner Jr . — now at the University of Missouri — but LaMontre’ Harvey, Antuan Quinlin and Terres Lagrome, are quick agile linemen who return.|1

The Eagles opened the night with a win over the University of Somerset at Somerset College, taking first place in the championship standings and also having their first career win of the year. In the end, however, it was a very good performance by the Eagles and their best ever. It was an even bigger win when the Eagles lost their second match in six matches. It was also a win for the Somerset seniors over the University of Worcester and Worcester College.|0
Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of flaws in the way universal credit is designed, campaigners say. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG ) said arbitrary rules built in to the way universal credit is calculated leave some families unable to predict how much they will be paid each month, leaving households in debt and unable to budget. It can lead to claimants being wrongly benefit-capped – a penalty designed to “incentivise” jobless or low-earning households by severely limiting their benefits – because the system fails to spot they are working and earning enough.|1

What 's the difference between bipolar I and bipolar II ? Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that causes mood disorders such as manic or mixed moods (e.g., mania) and has a high rate of self-harm and suicide, and may be associated with severe psychological distress. However, there are some studies that have indicated that both bipolar and bipolar II may be associated with a variety of mental health and physical health problems. This has prompted researchers to develop more scientific studies to identify the molecular and physiological processes that underlie the relationship between bipolar disorder and mood.|0
SHAH ALAM (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - The High Court in Shah Alam has rejected a bid to block the relocation of the Seafield Sri Maha Mariamman Temple in USJ 25 that was at the centre of riots earlier this week.

However, the High Court dismissed the injunction against a 2014 consent judgment ordering the temple to be relocated. Lawyer S.

Under Trump , presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor . Since discovering that he pardoned Michael Cohen in July 2017, many conservatives are still questioning his motives. Some conservatives are questioning how he would be punished in the same way it was before the pardon, while others, including Trump, question the legitimacy of his administration’s pardon process. This week on Fox News , Fox Business host John Dickerson, who has served under Trump for a decade, called on the American people to take up the question.|0

Officials said that the fire progressed into the roof of an attached residential-style portion of the building. Crews contained the fire to the building of origin using several handheld hose lines and an aerial ladder for safety.|1
Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “Thank You” rally was the crowd’s silence when Trump mentioned that everyone should come together. The irony being that his campaign has been anything but unifying, which is why his supporters backed him. They’re tired of seeing this country’s demographics being changed, their white privilege being challenged. Unity and inclusion is far from what these people want — even after the election’s over. I left Cincinnati tired and disheveled, but perhaps mostly worried about our future.|1
It 's hard to imagine that 2001 : A Space Odyssey would have its incredible cinematic impact without that classical love song. The story of Neil Armstrong landing on a mission to a distant space station is one I've written before and yet again. Armstrong was just 25 days away from being an all-time great — and yet he never made it to NASA, never made a solo mission to NASA, never set foot on Earth, never made it back home from Mars, never made it back to the moon.

For decades, aid groups have assumed they know what's best for refugees and the poor; a growing body of evidence suggests they're wrong. Both academic research and practical experience, such as with the mass of Syrians fleeing civil war, shows that simply handing out traditional relief goods may not be the most effective way of helping the dispossessed. Aid agencies are tentatively also giving away cash and letting refugees decide for themselves what they need. While the results may be unexpected, the money is being wisely spent and rarely wasted - contrary to old prejudices among donors.|1

The five-storied 'Farhad Mansion' resembles any other well-maintained house in an affluent neighbourhood of Chittagong city. Yet no gatekeeper guards any of the two steel gates that lead to the small front yard and the stairway of the building. With the summer holidays, it is not surprising that the ground and fourth floors that house an English medium school are deserted. But even the residential second and third floors show no signs of life. Climbing to the top, the locked grilled-gate to the roof is reached. Standing there, one cannot help but shudder, imagining what had happened there on April 27, 2012.|1
"In Syria, Peace Plan 'Is Unraveling' : The Two-Way ""It's almost as if in certain parts of the country the ceasefire isn't in effect anymore,"" NPR's Kelly McEvers reports. Syrian refugee children looked out of a bus last week after they arrived at a camp in Turkey. The U.N.-brokered plan to stop the killing in Syria ""is unraveling,"" as guest host Lynn Neary said earlier on Morning Edition. Lynn spoke with NPR's Kelly McEvers, who is monitoring the situation in Syria from Beirut. Kelly said that in some places ""shelling by Syrian military troops continues unabated."""|1
Veronica Fatia carries her 2-year-old daughter as they travel in a wooden boat to Buzi district , 120 miles outside Rome, Italy for a wedding to celebrate her husband’s victory in the European presidential elections.

"NSA Director General Keith Alexander maintains that his agency's tactics are lawful and used against foreign adversaries. The National Security Agency is using the tracking data intended for Google's advertisers to locate its targets. According to the Washington Post's new analysis of an internal presentation Edward Snowden leaked earlier in the year, the NSA has been using the numeric identifiers in Google's ""PREF"" cookies for hacking. A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website that is stored in a user's browser.

MANCHESTER UNITED outcast Morgan Schneiderlin has emerged as a January target for Inter Milan, according to reports. Schneiderlin has fallen down the pecking order at Manchester United under Jose Mourinho. Despite Bastian Schweinsteiger also being marginalised, Schneiderlin has been unable to force his way into the side over the likes of Paul Pogba, Ander Herrera, Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini. United are set to cut their losses on the midfielder this summer just 18 months after he signed for £24million from Southampton. And Italian website Calcio Mercato claim that Inter Milan want to bring the France international to the San Siro.|1
It has seemed for a while as though the global financial storm was going to deal a mostly glancing blow to the technology industry. Everybody hurts when markets go into free fall (and, as we're writing this on Wednesday afternoon, the Dow Jones has just closed down another 189 points -- although, as always, it could be up 500 points again by the time you read this). But if Wall Street and the banking sector are having a tornado rip through their gilded trailer parks, tech has, thus far, mostly just experienced some rain and a few gusts of wind in its relatively quiet suburb.|1

So, perhaps it is a good thing to have President Trump in the White House.|1
BAGHDAD -- The Iraqi government launched an investigation yesterday into the apparent torture of detainees in a secret Interior Ministry jail after the US military found 173 prisoners inside who appeared to have been abused, Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari said. It was the first time that the country's US-backed government installed in April had acknowledged the possible abuse of prisoners at one of its facilities. The detainees appeared to have been mostly Sunni Arabs, a group that has long contended that Shi'ite Muslim militias close to the political parties that dominate Iraq's ruling coalition are carrying out a shadowy campaign of vendettas against perceived political and sectarian foes.|1

"You have to give Square Enix points for honesty; Bravely Default: For the Sequel wears its primary intentions right on its sleeve. I mean, it's right in the title: ""For the Sequel."" The new updated version of the original Bravely Default: Flying Fairy is currently being developed in parallel to the game's upcoming as-of-yet untitled sequel. However, unlike your standard updated rerelease of a game, Square Enix is looking to use For the Sequel as a testing bed for the sequel (Christ, how many times am I going to have to use that term.)."|1
When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher, only the deepest, most corrosive cynicism is possible. Trampling on the rights of others for political advantage was the modus operandi of Adelaide's Nomenclature Committee in 1837. Western Buddhism and Pentecostalism are sometimes criticised as self-indulgent forms of religion. Is Bishop Spong's Christian humanism any different? The press coverage of Iraq’s surprise victory in the Asian Cup final was — as Ernst Bloch might have put it — full of utopian sentiment. The win was, admittedly, a remarkable achievement, but one that hardly accounted for the sheer exuberance of the outpoured emotion that followed.|1
BALTIMORE -- Mayor Martin O'Malley says his role in a new John Travolta film , `` Ladder 49 , '' '' has been a blessing for the city since it began filming in 1996. `` Ladder 49 was conceived by the film producer and director, Brian O'Malley, who said it's the best of all the city's film films. `` Ladder 49 was conceived in 1984, it was shot on location, and it was produced by the City of Baltimore and released on the same day,'' said the mayor.

Although state trademark registration offers fewer benefits than trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office , state and local trademark registration may be very useful. For instance, if a registered trademark with the U. S. Copyright Office does not contain the trademark U.S. trademark in its entirety, it is more useful to create a new state trademark from scratch. Also, as a general rule, registered trademarks are more valuable than public domain trademark registrants and state registraries. In addition to state trademark registration , the U. S. Copyright Office also retains the trademark registration and other aspects of its own registration in the states.|0
Under Trump, presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor. Since discovering that the constitution gives him the somewhat controversial power to absolve criminals who are also his friends, Donald Trump has pardoned more people and commuted more sentences in his first 18 months in office than any of his three immediate predecessors. The pardoning spree continued on Tuesday, as Trump issued two more before jetting off to Europe to stomp all over NATO, this time clearing the names of father-son arsonist duo Dwight and Steven Hammond, Oregon cattle ranchers whose 2016 fight against the federal government became a conservative cause célèbre.|1

The child was transported to Albemarle Hospital by Perquimans County emergency personnel who tried the save the child by administering CPR. The boy died at the hospital Tuesday evening. Freeman said the grandmother fainted in the yard of the home and was also taken to the hospital.|1
In developed capitalist democracies , financial , media and energy companies are private enterprises that don ’ t report to the state without any official oversight. If you look at most of these activities you will see that they have the same function as other public enterprises like oil companies , public utilities , nuclear power , electric utilities and other forms of industrial companies. The fact that these are private enterprises is a major problem for the governments. If they did not comply, we would not have this problem for a lot of reasons. We can see how the government would want to make their own laws regarding this.|0

WINNIPEG — Turning trash into treasure is somewhat of an art form , but the new season of a HGTV show — as much as it might appear — is a much different thing. It’s not just the show’s producers, however, and the actors and actresses who make the show’s costumes and stunts, though they’re often cast on a lot of the shows that make them, have become so familiar with their characters and their lives that they are no longer able to tell the full story about them.|0

Neighbouring Canna, to which it is linked by a bridge. But it isn't much bigger. The most westerly of the Small Isles archipelago, Canna's population is just 12 - or one per square kilometre."|1

If you live along the Eastern Seaboard and wake up early Friday you could be treated to a colorful sky hours before sunrise lights up the horizon. The Terrier-Improved Malumute sounding rocket is scheduled for launch Friday between 4:26 a.m. and 4:41 a.m. ET. Sounding rockets, by the way, have been used for over 40 years to carry science payloads on brief, 5-20 minute missions to space. Friday morning should provide mostly clear skies in the viewing location, and upper level winds should be friendly enough to allow the launch to take place (if not, backup launch dates are available each morning through June 6).|1

The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep. That is the provocative implication of recent research that examined investors’ financial risk-taking following periods when their sleep was disrupted. I concede that advice to get more sleep is hardly new, since we’ve been hearing that most of our lives — and the advice is honored more in the breach than in the observance. Furthermore, retirees typically would like to sleep more, but can’t — due to the disruptions in sleep patterns that are a normal part of the aging process.|1

Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child’s play, thanks to MIT. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a parser that imitates kids’ learning processes by observing the environment and making connections. The system studies captioned videos and learns to associate words with objects and actions. When given a new sentence, the parser can accurately predict its meaning—without visual clues. This “weakly supervised” approach, which requires limited training input, could expand the types of data and reduce the effort needed for training parsers. Annotations can certainly speed up the process, but they’re not needed to learn.|1

WASHINGTON — Thousands of commuters across the region were delayed Thursday morning by an apparent work action by Metro’s largest union. About 20 percent of bus service was impacted by the “late out,” Metro spokeswoman Sherri Ly said, which meant many buses either arrived late or did not arrive at all across Maryland, Virginia and the District because drivers reported to work well after the scheduled starts of their shifts. Late in the morning, Metro told riders about the delays via Twitter. Many riders had been complaining about missing buses or longer-than usual waits for hours.|1
"The hyperloop train is leaving the station – and the UK must be on it | City A.M.
Steve Norris is former Conservative transport minister. Britain can reasonably claim to have invented the railway. Stephenson’s Rocket represented the pinnacle of British industrial-era innovation. The ability to move products and people by steam locomotion had a transformative effect on society. British ingenuity saw railways knit communities together across the country, and eventually the globe. And for the next couple of centuries, little changed. The same techniques are being used to maintain track now that were used in Stephenson’s time."|1
Could Washington state elect the greenest governor in the nation? All around the country this election season, we’ve got Democrats who don’t want to talk about climate change and Republicans who don’t even acknowledge that climate change is real. But in the Washington state governor’s race, it’s a whole different ballgame. The Democrat, Jay Inslee, is a longtime, outspoken crusader for climate action and clean energy. The Republican, Rob McKenna, is one of a vanishing breed of Republicans who not only acknowledge that climate change is happening but support government action to fight it.|1

JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar: for more than two decades, women have been making a monthly pilgrimage to pray at one of Judaism’s holiest sites in a manner traditionally preserved for men, and the police have stopped them in the name of maintaining public order. But after a flurry of arrests this fall that set off an international outcry, the women arrived for December’s service to find a new protocol ordered by the ultra-Orthodox rabbi who controls the site.|1

ORANGEBURG, S.C. — Talk-show host and media mogul Oprah Winfrey has conducted a jailhouse interview with a South Carolina mother who pleaded guilty to killing her two sons. Winfrey went to the jail in Orangeburg last week where 30-year-old Shaquan Duley is awaiting sentencing.

House Republicans weren ’ t talking about the economy as they left Washington for the August recess before a challenging election in November.

Trump, for the first time since he took office earlier this year, announced a budget plan for the fiscal 2017-18 budget.|0

When Pacers coach Frank Vogel announced he would sit all five starters for last night's game against the Bucks, it was like a thought experiment come to life. Can a good team's second unit beat the starters of a historically awful team? It was close, but...yes!

Because this wasn't Copeland and Solomon Hill and C.J. Watson getting meaningful minutes in just any late-season game—this game mattered.|1

AMD's Ryzen CPUs offer some of the best bang for the buck, but which is best? AMD knocked it out of the park with the first and second generations of its Ryzen CPUs built upon the Zen and Zen+ architecture. It certainly helped wash away the taste of its less-than-stellar Bulldozer chips that launched in 2011. Ryzen provides far better per-core performance, power efficiency, and support for more modern technology. But that makes it harder than ever to decide which one to buy. The Ryzen family is broken into four distinct branches, targeting the entry-level, mainstream, performance, and high-end enthusiast sectors of the market.|1

There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams's performances that could, roughly, be called his American and British sides. On the American side, there was the slushy tendency towards sentimentality, for which he became increasingly known, which, at its best, resulted in Dead Poets Society, The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire, and, at its worst, became Patch Adams and Old Dogs. Hollywood has long had a tendency to adopt the finest and most interesting comedians and then determinedly blunt the hard edges that make them interesting. Along with Richard Pryor, Williams was the most obvious example of that.|1

Penney's same-store sales may decline as much as 5 percent this month, they said. The company's goal was to increase sales as much as 4 percent.|1
It's Memorial Day Weekend, and that means hitting up the best sales, whether at the store or from the comfort of your own home. It also means a ton of cool movies are coming out, like Wes Anderson's latest flick, Moonrise Kingdom (we recently broke down The 10 Most Stylish Wes Anderson Characters). If you're lucky though, you're at the beach. Even if you aren't, that doesn't mean you can't welcome in the summer with a warm weather-approriate kit. Might as well learn from some dudes that are doing it right.|1
With the economic noose poised to tighten around Iran over its suspect nuclear program, the Tehran regime is shaking a stick at Gulf nations. Tensions in the Persian Gulf and modest economic recovery in the United States could influence retail gasoline prices, analysts said. The International Energy Agency could respond to a major Middle East oil crisis but doesn't see any immediate need for action, the group's director said. Military officials in Tehran said the United States can not stop Iran from preventing oil from passing through the strategic Strait of Hormuz.|1

"Jack Kerouac cruised the bohemian North Beach neighborhood here in the 1950s intent on achieving nothing less than freedom of speech, though it could have been achieved with much more skill. There are some good books here, but there are two that aren't quite like the books on the internet, and I've always wondered why I didn't come here. I don't want to put too much blame, or blame it, on anyone here, either. But when I do come, I can't help wondering, ""Hey, do I need to go to my local bookstore and get the same book?"|0

I ’ m still not convinced Foreman is the answer — they ’ d be crazy not to draft a “long story”. But, if it’s the sort of solution you want to be, it’s a pretty good solution, if it works for everyone, and it’s a pretty good solution, but it’s a lot of work. I got to say I’m “blessing foreman” (I like the idea) and that “the best” is the best solution. The worst is the worst.|0
In the week between Christmas and New Years , Gov . George Pataki signed into law two bills sponsored by the New York Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), which are intended to provide a platform for teachers unions to express their opinions on a wide range of issues, including employment-based policies. These bills and others, are part of a broader effort by some teachers union leaders to encourage their colleagues to read and write the bills. They are part of the same effort, but not necessarily related.|0

"School opened this week, so I thought this exploration would be appropriate and valuable. Recently, I was conducting a class on business communication, and a participant brought up what might be new trend in customer service. A similar idea had been suggested in an earlier MBA graduate class I was teaching, so I suspect there might be something going on in the business world that could be worth considering. Like most ""new"" items, this one has both good and bad aspects to it. The new trend relates to what is happening in large call centers."|1
One minute he was strutting around the end zone, staring into the stands, the look of a stone-cold killer in his eyes. The next, Golden Tate was tossing his helmet to the ground in a fit of frustration, stunned – like most everyone else in Ford Field – at what he’d just heard. The Detroit Lions had a win stolen from them in the cruelest of fashions Sunday, when Matthew Stafford appeared to throw the game-winning touchdown pass to Tate with 8 seconds left, only to have the score overturned on replay and the game ended by a mandatory 10-second clock runoff.|1

On April 22, 2014, Hollingsworth was supposed to drop off 20-month-old Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth at a child-care center about 7:30 a.m. But he “forgot her in the car,” according to an arrest warrant affidavit filed by a North Richland Hills police investigator. “This is a disabled veteran who had several things on his mind that day and just forgot,” Lex Johnston of Hurst, Hollingsworth’s attorney, said Tuesday. Johnston said Hollingsworth’s daughter and four children were living with him, and he took the daughter to work, paid for child care and drove the grandchildren to day care or school.|1
BOB Cole died yesterday. Around 2pm in a purpose-built flat on a Swiss industrial estate outside Zurich, he said goodbye to his friends, and went to sleep for the last time. He was 68, terminally ill, and was taking his life into his own hands, as around 30 Britons do each year at the Dignitas. His wife, Pam, was one of them. She was suffering from progressive supernuclear palsy, a fatal brain disease, and faced a terrible death. In February last year she died as Chris de Burgh’s Here is Your Paradise played at her bedside.|1
Certainly one of the most brilliant dialogues in the ballet is its pas de deux. It was danced excellently and very dif ferently by twirl casts last week end in the New York City Bal let's current season at the State Theater. Sunday night marked the welcome return, after almost year's absence, of Arthur Mit dell. Matching the crystalline purity of Kay Mazzo, Mr. Mit 001 swung into his original sole with admirable flow and brio. By contrast, the catlike stealth of Jean‐Pierre Bonne fous in his local debut in the role gave it a note of emotion ally colored caution.|1
No doubt if you are into painting of the artistic kind then you will probably know that artist Thomas Kinkade passed away last Friday, and although an autopsy has been completed, it appears that an announcement as to the cause of Kinkade’s death could be weeks away, as the Santa Clara County coroner is awaiting results of tests before deciding on the cause of death. However, according to the LA Times, the artist’s family attribute the painter’s death to natural causes, but this will be determined by the coroner.|1

Clinton said this week paid family leave is possible by taxing the wealthy but states have done so without soaking the rich. In her opening statement at the first Democratic debate Tuesday, Hillary Clinton mentioned the need for paid family leave, and when asked about it later, she said it was possible to pay for it by having the wealthy foot the bill. The line may be good fodder for Democrats, but looking at how states have done it, as well as current national proposals, show other ways to pay for the policy without soaking the rich.|1

To any objective observer, the consensus that exists between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the fundamental issues of war and peace, Wall Street’s dominance of American life, and fiscal austerity, has been made crystal clear in the two “debates.” In the absence of effective popular resistance to the duopoly of money, the economic and social crisis fails to create a corresponding political crisis for the rulers. As a result, there is nothing important for them to debate. The two titans of America’s finance capitalist duopoly clashed – leaving behind a dull fart.|1

For three turbulent centuries, the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into the hearts of medieval Europeans. Indeed, the Viking Age, from A.D. 800-1100, was the age of the sleek, speedy longship. Without this crucial advance in ship technology, the Vikings would never have become a dominant force in medieval warfare, politics, and trade. With their invention of the longship, the Vikings spurred a literal sea change in medieval European affairs. The drekar, or dragon-headed longships, were stealthy troop-carriers.|1

The Jawbone Up debuted last year with big ambitions: A bracelet-like device that you'd wear all the time, tracking how much you move and how well you sleep. Paired with an app, the Up helps you recognize patterns in your habits, empowering you to improve your health. One problem: It wasn't built to withstand the punishment of being a wearable device. Unlike a cellphone that resides in your pocket or a bag, the Up wraps around your wrist, exposed to the world just as much as your skin is. Many users found it quickly malfunctioned, and Jawbone recalled the Up and issued refunds.|1

At one time, he had 120 peony plants blooming in the backyard of his former home on Hillandale Circle.|1
"The proposal that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to stem migration is nothing but 'hipster' colonialism. Last week, Germany's Africa Commissioner Gunter Nooke said that European countries should be allowed to lease land and to build and run cities in Africa as a means of stemming what he views as the unchecked expansion of migration from Africa to Europe. For Nooke, allowing the ""free development"" of these areas would stimulate African economies and create ""growth and prosperity"" and therefore, reduce the attractiveness of Europe as a destination for migration. The proposal has elicited mixed reactions."|1
Fast bowler Matt Hobden has been tipped for a bright future as he bids to bounce back from one of the darkest days in his fledgling career. Hobden’s encouraging start to the season came to a grinding halt in the previous Championship match against Middlesex at Hove. The 22-year-old from Eastbourne lost his rhythm completely as he committed 11 no-balls in 16 overs in the first innings and another three in the second. His struggles were highlighted by an injury to Ajmal Shahzad on the opening day which prevented skipper Ed Joyce from withdrawing him from the attack.|1

Beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl is never easy. When they scored 21 points the first three times they held the ball in the second half and took a 33-32 lead, we all thought the same scary movie we’ve seen since 2001 was replaying before our eyes. But this epic brought a different ending. This one saw Foles, a man of faith who wants to be a pastor when he leaves the game, play as if touched by God. He completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.|1

The system is divided into 2 stages : the training stage , the test stage , and the evaluation stage , all of which are part of the learning process.|0
I’m still not convinced Foreman is the answer — they’d be crazy not to draft a running back next year — but for now Foreman might get goalline work and has speed to do a little more. When Cooper Kupp sustained an ACL tear, the question was whether Reynolds could step into his role as an equal partner in the Rams’ pass-catching triumvirate. He leaped the first hurdle with flying colors: six catches for 80 yards and a score against the Chiefs. The Rams operate out of three-receiver 11 personnel an insane 98 percent of time, per sharpfootballstats.com.|1

Nintendo’s ancient Power Glove remains a part of popular culture because, one, it was an epic, ET: The Game-style failure and, two, because it was a power glove. There’s something about the mammalian brain that just likes the idea of being able to reach out and touch a digital objects — that is the point at which virtual worlds could become credible representations of the real world. Still, most attempts to recreate the power glove mentality, to let you use your hands to naturally manipulate digital objects in three dimensions, have been failures.|1
Hi, National Geographic, it's me, Ryan. I got your package today and I guess I'm wondering - why did you send me a pseudoscientific crystal healing water bottle with your name on it?

American troops may have finally left Iraq, but for that nation's citizens the war is only getting worse. American troops may have finally left Iraq, but for that nation's citizens the war is only getting worse. More than 700 people, mostly civilians, were killed in violent attacks last month, making it the deadliest calendar month since June 2008. Nearly all of those killed were attacked in the capital of Baghdad. The sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims has escalated in recent months, and the minority Sunnis have turned up the protests of the Shia-led government—leading to violent confrontations with police.|1

"Sunni Fighters Returning To Al-Qaida In Iraq, 'NYT' Reports : The Two-Way After months of being squeezed out by the Shi'ite led government, there are increasing reports that men who used to fight against al-Qaida are now being recruited by them. The success of the ""surge"" in Iraq was based on a number of things beyond the introduction of more American troops and their counter insurgency strategy. Among them, cease fire by Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army, the ethnic cleansing of Baghdad, and the Sunni Awakening. The Awakening was made up of Sunnis who turned against al-Qaida in Iraq in their areas."|1
The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has proposed to ask some insurance companies to mandatorily list on exchanges based on the number of years they have been in business. In a discussion paper on listing of Indian insurance firms, Irdai said it would direct general insurers (including health and reinsurers) to take steps to get listed after they complete eight years of operations. This will also apply to all life insurers that have completed 10 years. Irdai said firms that have already exceeded these criteria must list within three years from the date when the guidelines are issued.|1

German scientists working on the Wendelstein 7-X fusion device started a series of experiments that could eventually prove the superiority of a new technology at the time. But the research team has now shown that the proposed technology could also allow for other applications of the technology, which in turn may be able to extend the limits of a technology and could also allow a new form of communication technology to be developed instead of conventional technology. They were part of a group led by Hans-Georg Henke, professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Jena.|0
Keep it classy. Cheer. Revel in a rival. And Yankees - keep it brief, a simple ceremony of appreciation. Sure, there will be temptation for fans to boo one of the faces of the Red Sox's championship seasons in 2004, 2007 and 2013. Big Papi has tormented the Yankees over the years, pounding 52 homers against them (51 as a member of the Sox), and taking forever to round the bases after each one. Yes, there are some who speculate whether Ortiz did PEDs and won't like the idea of Ortiz being honored on the Stadium field because of that.|1

Two years ago, Red Sox prospect Ryan Westmoreland seemed to be on the fast track to the majors. The Portsmouth native, who the Sox selected in the fifth round of the 2008 draft, got off to a blazing start in his professional career in 2009 in Single-A Lowell. In 60 games with the Spinners, the outfielder hit .296 with seven homers and 19 stolen bases, and his five-tool potential helped him quickly ascend up everyone's list of top Red Sox prospects. But all of that changed in a hurry when, in March of 2010, he was diagnosed with a cavernous malformation in his brain.|1

No doubt if you are into painting of the artistic kind then you will probably know that artist Thomas Kinkade was not so much a painter as he was a watercolour, a sketching artist and a watercolorist.

I know I said that watercolours were not a painter, but there are some similarities between me, which I know is true. I am not saying you cannot have good watercolours.|0

A new study for The New York Times reveals that the media pay for the top 200 CEOs is now $14.5 million. This is up 55 in the last year. While any one CEO may be well worth his/her raise, it is a growing political and PR problem for corporate America to be seen as rewarding those at the top, with little consideration for actual performance. For millions of Americans who are unemployed, under employed and being foreclosed on, it seems inconceivable that corporate CEOs can be getting significant raises at a time of such economic hardship.|1

According to the European Union’s Food Safety Directive, animal-control and management of cattle’s milk must be in place before the cow has had any milk produced. In addition, the European Union has put a prohibition on animals that breed for up to 7 years to a maximum of three years.|0

Have you heard the latest uproar? Of course you haven't - it's too loud. So say some residents who frequent downtown. Others say the bluster is louder than any motorcycle exhaust pipe. We say everyone should turn down the volume on complaining and let people go about their own business downtown. Also, let the police do their job. There is already a downtown noise ordinance in place, and the police reported to the city Tuesday that new measures are coming. First, the bikers."|1
Where do we begin to try to describe this restaurant? Probably the best place is first to apologize for keeping this secret to ourselves for such a long time. We have agonized over whether to publicize this jewel, and have finally decided it really is our responsibility to share this fantastic place with you. So what makes this such a special find? After all, there are some delightful restaurants in Bratislava, and this gastronomic oasis is 140 kilometers away. Why should we encourage you to take this drive? Simply, it is a combination of the people, the food, and the service.|1

For the past 20 years, he has worked solo. Thompson was ""boxed"" once before in the early SSRq90s on a collection of out-takes and obscurities."|1

In short, there’s a big difference between “security concerns” and the security of Israel: security concerns are more serious in the world than the security of the Palestinian people and it’s their security concerns that make for a major security problem in the Middle East, but it’s not clear how to deal with the security of the people of Israel in this context."|0

In recent years, platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their artistry. For the generation of designers who grew up playing “Super Mario Bros.” platformers offer a sound formula. Though the goal of such games is usually to get from one area to the next, that framework supports copious possibilities. Determining how a character moves through a world and what sorts of things should impede or assist in the process allows plenty of room for creativity. It is why games like “Journey” and “Inside” can both be constructed around jumping avatars but otherwise appear quite distinct.|1
Jill McGown, who has died aged 59 from cancer, was one of the generation of crime writers who shifted the genre firmly into the contemporary world. Although she held fast to the traditional skill of well-crafted plots, she brought a modern perspective to characters and situations, creating a series of thoughtful and engaging police procedurals. She will be best remembered for the 13 novels featuring Chief Inspector Danny Lloyd and Sergeant Judy Hill. Theirs was a relationship that encompassed the personal as well as the professional, and Jill's deft handling of its development was one of the keynote elements of the books.|1

COLOGNE CATHEDRAL SWITCHED off its light last night, in protest at the weekly anti-Islam rallies happening in Dresden.

"You may remember Gary Coleman, the child actor from the 1970s show ""Diff'rent Strokes."" Coleman died on May 28, 2010, in Provo, Utah, from an intracranial hemorrhage. There is much that can be learned from Coleman's less-than-perfect estate plan. However, to understand where Coleman went wrong, some context is needed. Coleman, like many child actors, had a very sad and tragic life. After ""Diff'rent Strokes"" ended its successful eight year run, Coleman sued his parents for misappropriating millions of dollars in his trust fund."|1

What Steve Lonegan can teach Republicans about making life hell for Democrats. New Jersey Senate candidate Steve Lonegan may not beat Cory Booker, but his run offers some interesting lessons for Republicans. I’m betting that the candidate with the poll lead, higher favorables, and more experienced campaign team will, indeed, win, but I’m interested in how the race has become a test kitchen for attacks on liberals. Steve Lonegan, Booker’s opponent, is running his third statewide campaign, his first as a nominee.|1
"Minister for Enterprise and Commerce, Max Bradford, today rejected claims by the Engineers Union that jobs created by the Employment Contracts Act are predominantly casual, part-time and low-paid.

The market may be even more volatile than a few days ago, however, as prices for real estate go down, the price of homes is likely to be lower for buyers, which in turn could be creating a new cycle for buyers who are considering buying more homes in the past.|0

The first image of Earth from lunar orbit. Before an Apollo-era NASA could launch a few humans on top of a rocket and plop them down on the moon, it needed to find safe places to land. So from 1966 through 1967, the space agency launched five spacecraft, which it creatively named Lunar Orbiters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Lunar Orbiter 1 was the first to swing around the moon. It automatically took film photos, processed and scanned them, then beamed the images back as radiowaves to receivers on Earth, where technicians recorded them onto analog data tapes.|1

In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don’t report to presidents. In Russia, things are different. Most of those businesses are majority-state-owned corporations, virtual branches of the government.

In 2000, when Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency, he consolidated competing power centers — media, business, local government, opposition parties and the Parliament — under his authority. He called it “a vertical of power.” This system now includes organized crime and cybercriminals.|1

The popular charges against Catholics were honed in the Great War and particularly by the referenda on Conscription.|1

"The right sheet set and pajamas can help you stay cool. Today’s memory-foam mattresses don't sleep as ""hot"" as older models did, thanks to air-circulating layers and ventilated toppers that keep the foam from absorbing and retaining all your body heat. But a certain insulating effect is unavoidable when you're sleeping on a foam block. If your memory foam mattress leaves you sweating at night, a few remedies can help turn down the heat -- if only by a few degrees. Anything you can do to distance your body from the memory foam will help keep you cool."|1

"John Bennett(July 20), a teacher at Westside Middle School, was upset by the School Board's decision to have teachers teach all sides of any controversy. He is right, of course, that pretending all sides of any controversy are equally valid is nonsense. But a good deal of the issue hinges on our definition of ""teaching"" a position. If ""teaching"" means that the teacher merely presents all sides of a controversy as though they were equal in weight and legitimacy, then we are being equal time indoctrinists."|1
