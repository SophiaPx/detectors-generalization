BANGKOK (Reuters) - The leader of Thailand’s military junta said on Thursday that Yingluck Shinawatra, the prime minister he ousted three years ago, was in Dubai, where she fled last month to avoid being jailed over a rice subsidy scheme that lost billions of dollars.

For decades , aid groups have assumed they know what 's best for refugees and the poor ; a growing number of them have even gone on to provide them with services that, in some cases, have turned their work into a political agenda.

A report by the Center for Immigration Studies , a pro-immigration-rights group that focuses on legal issues, finds that more than 40 percent of these refugees receive no financial assistance from their governments.|0

I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad’s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should not constantly be called to account for the vicious behaviour of IS. Still less to be stigmatised until unnamed Muslim leaders disowned it. I was disconcerted to see so many Eureka Street readers appeared to agree with the demands against which she protested. Both Ruby’s complaint and the responses to it reminded me of the attitudes taken to Catholics in an earlier generation. The popular charges against Catholics were honed in the Great War and particularly by the referenda on Conscription.|1

A new report says the giant toy chain has hired a law firm to help restructure its roughly $400 million in debt. Toys R Us relies heavily on holiday sales to support year-round business, and 2016 proved to be a disappointment for the Wayne, N.J.-based company, and CNBC said those weaknesses carried into the spring with a net loss of $164 million in the first quarter of 2017.|1
"The right sheet set and pajamas can help you stay cool. Today’s memory-foam mattresses don't sleep as ""hot"" as older models did, thanks to air-circulating layers and ventilated toppers that keep the foam from absorbing and retaining all your body heat. But a certain insulating effect is unavoidable when you're sleeping on a foam block. If your memory foam mattress leaves you sweating at night, a few remedies can help turn down the heat -- if only by a few degrees. Anything you can do to distance your body from the memory foam will help keep you cool."|1

WASHINGTON — Thousands of commuters across the region were delayed Thursday morning by an apparent work action by Metro ’s bus system, even as the transit agency continues to battle what officials describe as the largest infrastructure project in decades. About 11 a.m., a commuter on a weekday morning bus service between the airport and downtown was forced to walk from the parking garage to the subway station for the 5 p.m. to midnight trip. The same commuter was forced to walk several times before he finally arrived at the station, a little more than eight minutes later, Metro spokeswoman Lauren Hitt told a reporter in a news conference Thursday morning.|0
ASTANA, Kazakhstan—Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s first and only president, resigned on Tuesday, ending his nearly 30-year reign and setting the stage for an opaque succession process in the oil-rich Central Asian country of 18 million people. As his speech hinted, Nazarbayev’s departure from office will not mean giving up the reins of power. The aging leader, who has led Kazakhstan since 1989, when it was still part of the Soviet Union, said that Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the speaker of the Senate and a trusted political ally of Nazarbayev, will take over as acting president until new elections are held in 2020.|1
Where will he wake up next? A prison cell? A tropical hammock? Or suspended on a cliff? It has the makings of a pretty good TV show, in the vein of Quantum Leap. Each day, a man wakes up to find himself in a different bed in a different part of the world. The experience, while clearly always disorienting, can vary dramatically based on the circumstances. Some days he’s in prison, or squatting in a storage bin. Other mornings he wakes up in a goat pen or a tropical hammock.|1

It's not your imagination—but you should blame the candidates, not the media. The father in question has voiced similar complaints. “I think it’s a big mistake; this constant four-year, peripatetic campaign is not good for America. We need to deal with the business we have before us,” Bill Clinton told CNN in December. Of course, neither Clinton is a particularly reliable narrator here, because it’s the third member of the Clinton clan who is responsible for much of the ink that has been spilled about an election still more than two and a half years away.|1

Most people have heard of Scrooge, even if they have never read A Christmas Carol or any other work of Charles Dickens, writes Adrian Hattrell. What is certain is that they have never experienced the story in the form of a folk opera, which is what was presented to Tickhill Music Society by the group calling itself Green Matthews and Guest – which comprised of Chris Green, Sophie Matthews and Jude Rees. The players set the scene with a medley of Victorian carols, music hall songs and folk songs, accompanying themselves on an astonishing range of period instruments, which were variously blown, plucked and squeezed.|1
A new study for The New York Times reveals that the media pay for the top 200 CEOs is now $14.5 million. This is up 55 in the last year. While any one CEO may be well worth his/her raise, it is a growing political and PR problem for corporate America to be seen as rewarding those at the top, with little consideration for actual performance. For millions of Americans who are unemployed, under employed and being foreclosed on, it seems inconceivable that corporate CEOs can be getting significant raises at a time of such economic hardship.|1
It takes a community to help migrant workers who need affordable medical care and social assistance .

The Australian telecommunications (telco) industry is largely responsible for the highly connected and digital world we live in today. Their networks and services have fostered professional work environments and have brought together family and friends amidst Australia’s vast distances, and remote global position. But to continue doing so at an ever-changing pace, telco providers must accelerate their digital revolution. In fact Accenture, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, has estimated that digitalisation could contribute approximately $100 trillion in value to the telecommunications industry over the next decade globally. Australian telecommunications operators have long maintained vast networks, held together by complex infrastructure.|1

Will an upcoming vote in Congress signal the end of Medicare? In the next few weeks Congress will decide whether to cut $54 billion in overpayments to Medicare insurers, igniting a battle that may well determine whether the program survives. On one side are Medicare supporters, who want it to continue as a successful social insurance program. On the other is the insurance industry, which is spending millions and lobbying hard to put Medicare on a fast track to privatization, a goal long sought by fiscal conservatives and their allies in right-wing think tanks.|1

In developed capitalist democracies , financial , media and energy companies are private enterprises that don ’ t report to governments, regulators or the public. Instead, they operate as independent, autonomous, profit-seeking organizations, with the ability to create wealth and influence government policy and legislation through lobbying , direct funding of politicians and use of the public purse. The world’s first publicly owned financial company, the privately owned Royal Bank of Scotland , set up to provide liquidity to British and other global financial institutions, was established in 1707 and has become a fixture of global capitalism.|0
For Bruce Logan , microbes are an electrifying subject .

Now he’s doing just that by collaborating with scientists in the United Arab Emirates to discover whether bacteria in the desert are vulnerable to the same threats as those encountered by their microbial neighbors in the temperate and tropical zones of the globe.

The Brexit crowd refused to believe the experts in the run-up to the referendum vote . The warnings from every source – from the Leave campaign to experts on the EU – were that a “no-deal” scenario – where Britain remained locked into the EU single market for ever – would be a catastrophe, with the entire economy falling apart. It was a scenario the Leave campaigners were so sure would happen that they even had a mock-up in place, ready to be put to the people of Britain before the snap election.

Chipolo Plus is supposedly the loudest Bluetooth item tracker available today, and its chirpy tune can be heard from a greater distance than other similar trackers.

So can you tell the difference between those dB levels? In my tests, I could indeed hear Chipolo Plus a little bit better than the other trackers, though the difference is subtle.|1

"Peter Brown took the precaution of carrying a parachute on his home-made plane but it wasn&apos;t enough to save him. Mr Brown, 57, was found dead inside the wreckage of his home-made ultralight after crashing in trees, metres from the Lovedale Store and Cafe in the Hunter Valley cafe yesterday. Hunter Valley Inspector Peter Vromans confirmed his parachute was onboard but it had not been deployed. ""That will be part of the investigations,"" he said.

The ease of Manchester United’s win over Premier League title rivals Chelsea masked a potential moment of controversy after an “innovative” corner routine involving Wayne Rooney, Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo produced a goal, with the scores still level, that was disallowed under instruction from the linesman. Step Two: Ryan Giggs picks up the loose ball following Rooney's hand-over. United manager Sir Alex Ferguson expressed astonishment that the effort, converted by Ronaldo, did not stand, admitting the routine had been planned on the training ground. Step one: Wayne Rooney goes over to corner flag to take quick set-piece.|1

The food is served with the highest level of professionalism. You cannot go to this restaurant and expect it to have any mediocre food.

The Fox Sports commentary team covering an Australian Boomers basketball game have been left in a state of shock after the Australian women's basketball team won its sixth straight World Cup title. Last year's World Cup final between the USA and Brazil was a closely contested affair that went to overtime, with the Brazilians coming on a last-second three-pointer at the final buzzer. This year's tournament will be played over three days and it is the biggest game of the Boomers' six-year history, with the US squad playing in front of an expected sell-out crowd that has been growing steadily.|0
The new law finishes old business in Trenton and expands the so-called Tuition Equality Act , which let qualified immigrants bring in $15,600 a year to pay off student loans for their kids . Tuition-shaming is not a good idea. And it’s not even fair. When I was a college student, it was all about getting the education I deserved and helping my fellow students get ahead in life. Now that students have to pay for it all themselves, with no government help, this is unfair to them. There are also other costs, like increased taxes and higher costs for housing.|0
While it’s not the most glamorous construction project, the state Department of Transportation says it’s something that needs fixing. No, we’re not talking about something on the scale of four Route 8/25 bridges in Bridgeport that were demolished and erected over just one summer. It’s the replacement of old sign supports that hold up those large green signs that direct us at intersections and exits. “The new sign supports are necessary because the old sign supports have reached the end of their life expectancy. The new supports will comply with the latest state and federal standards,” DOT says.|1

Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of flaws in the way universal credit is designed, campaigners say. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG ) said arbitrary rules built in to the way universal credit is calculated leave some families unable to predict how much they will be paid each month, leaving households in debt and unable to budget. It can lead to claimants being wrongly benefit-capped – a penalty designed to “incentivise” jobless or low-earning households by severely limiting their benefits – because the system fails to spot they are working and earning enough.|1

Why do we only hear about Jasper Johns when he gets ripped off ? Jasper Johns is the greatest artist of our generation, and now he is on trial for ripping off the world ? How did he get away with it? How many artists have ever been exposed for rip offs before he gets away with it? How many have ever been accused of rip offs ? The fact is that it only took Jasper a decade to get off, but now it’s just happening all the time. Is there not some kind of a balance to be found, as to whether Jasper is guilty or not?|0

WINNIPEG — Turning trash into treasure is somewhat of an art form , but the new season of a HGTV reality show about homes is making it more difficult for homeowners in Winnipeg to sell the stuff they won’t use up. “I think you can get a house for under a million dollars, and you can get it for under $400,000,” said one of the hosts of a show that aired last year about homes. “I think that’s pretty amazing, and I would never have been able to get it for that amount of money.|0

"The newest entry to the robo-advisory service is TIAA . Part of the allure for firms is to appeal to them, but there are ways to do so without actually talking to clients. For one, there is an online form and a phone chat option if the firm needs assistance. The form includes questions related to:

Why are they calling, and what are the issues they want resolved? What’s the process and timeline? Who is the client and what are their expectations? How long will the process take? How much will it cost to talk to them?"|0
So the latest Star Wars game has made tea-bagging Darth Vader ’ s smug Jedi son ’ s face an artform again.

Many Alberta small-business owners , who have been struggling through a prolonged economic downturn , are hoping the next provincial election campaign will offer them some relief. “For some of our employees, the downturn is a long-term problem, because it’s only been going on for five to 10 years now,” said Richard Cottrell, president and CEO of the Alberta Employers’ Federation (AEF), “but there are still many people that are losing their jobs or are struggling to find a job in Alberta, but they’re hopeful they can get it back on track if they’re willing to work hard.|0

Some restaurateurs are altering menus to accommodate dieters on macro diets. When Chicago-native Vince Schiano was working toward his goal to drop body fat, he’d often carry around a food scale, protein powder and a tupperware full of ground beef or turkey.

When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher, only the deepest, most corrosive cynicism is possible. Trampling on the rights of others for political advantage was the modus operandi of Adelaide's Nomenclature Committee in 1837. Western Buddhism and Pentecostalism are sometimes criticised as self-indulgent forms of religion. Is Bishop Spong's Christian humanism any different? The press coverage of Iraq’s surprise victory in the Asian Cup final was — as Ernst Bloch might have put it — full of utopian sentiment. The win was, admittedly, a remarkable achievement, but one that hardly accounted for the sheer exuberance of the outpoured emotion that followed.|1
California Communities Demand `` Rent Control Now ! '' Efforts to stabilize communities in California with with much needed rent control may soon be afoot once again, as the state is poised to introduce a sweeping new rent-control reform bill that is expected to take effect on June 5th.

Running errands on your bicycle is a great way to burn calories and get some exercise. When you need something small or you are just checking prices and availability, pedaling to the store can be a pleasant experience if you can find a bicycle-friendly route. Several major shopping locations in the Rogue Valley can be accessed by bicycles without encountering excessive traffic. For example, both the Rogue Valley Mall and the Medford Shopping Center are easily accessible from the Bear Creek Greenway bicycle path. It is somewhat more difficult to ride a bike to the big-box stores along Highway 62 (Crater Lake Highway).|1

After Superman and Mission : Impossible – Fallout , Henry Cavill has landed another highly coveted role . On Tuesday ( October 3 ), he will play Bruce Wayne/Batman, a new hero for the Dark Knight universe . The casting is a little odd, considering that Cavill only recently wrapped up The Batman .

"The proposal that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to stem migration is nothing but 'hipster' colonialism. Last week, Germany's Africa Commissioner Gunter Nooke said that European countries should be allowed to lease land and to build and run cities in Africa as a means of stemming what he views as the unchecked expansion of migration from Africa to Europe. For Nooke, allowing the ""free development"" of these areas would stimulate African economies and create ""growth and prosperity"" and therefore, reduce the attractiveness of Europe as a destination for migration. The proposal has elicited mixed reactions."|1

Considering all the comings and goings of people involved in the project, we should be grateful that Bohemian Rhapsody has finally landed on the big screen. Changing directors and lead actors puts a seed of doubt in minds as to how successful a film is likely to be. However, it’s a worthy biopic of Freddie Mercury, and Queen. There’s no argument that Rami Malek is great as the famed lead singer, but Ben Hardy (Roger Taylor), Gwilym Lee (Brian May) and Joseph Mazzello (John Deacon) also look and sound the part.|1

Fast bowler Matt Hobden has been tipped for a bright future as he bids to bounce back from one of the darkest days in his fledgling career. Hobden’s encouraging start to the season came to a grinding halt in the previous Championship match against Middlesex at Hove.

You hope and hope and hope, too frequently arriving at disappointment. Syrah is like soccer: 90 loping minutes of play for a final score of 2-1. I love watching soccer, and I love following syrah.|1

Women who work in the White House do earn equal pay. Another right-made-up fact. The Republicans with their 12 percent approval rating, don’t you wonder who are the 12 percent that think the people driving the clown car are doing a good job?

One wonders which of the two best reflects the reality in Sussiya. Yossi Melman wants to know how to stop a terrorist operating on his own (“How to stop a lone wolf,” Analysis, July 18). The answer?

BAMAKO , Mali – The head of an ethnic Dogon militia blamed for a massacre in central Mali is denying that he was a ‘rebel’ fighting for the central government, and says his group is “not aligned to any political party or leader”.

Following a team of international scientists, this film exclusively documents an archeological sensation: the exploration of royal tombs beneath the ancient Mexican city of Teotihuacán. Despite many decades of research, not much is known about the long-lost Teotihuacán society. But when archeologists enter the newly discovered burial chambers, they find the clues that may finally tell us who these mysterious people were. The film incorrectly states the city of Tikal is in Mexico when it is in Guatemala. Secrets of the Dead strives to get the facts correct and we regret the error.|1

We chose to question the narrative of history by simply quoting words which Churchill used himself.

Except, sitting in the mock air-raid shelter, drinking my flat white, I couldn’t help but feel ever more uncomfortable.|1

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praise her on his social network accounts, and spoke to Barzilai on the phone during the broadcast. The premier called Barzilai ""wonderful,"" and told her she ""charmed the whole world."" He concluded by saying she was Israel's greatest ambassador."|1

The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep. That is the provocative implication of recent research that examined investors’ financial risk-taking following periods when their sleep was disrupted. I concede that advice to get more sleep is hardly new, since we’ve been hearing that most of our lives — and the advice is honored more in the breach than in the observance. Furthermore, retirees typically would like to sleep more, but can’t — due to the disruptions in sleep patterns that are a normal part of the aging process.|1

"That's how I would characterize my minimal pre-service time. Fortunately and unfortunately though, I had very little time before my theoretical learning and my practical experience collided. Teaching was a second career and since I was a young twenty something with a rent, I couldn't afford to do all of my learning before I got into the classroom. Back in those days it was called ""alternative route."" The wisdom was to place an extremely green teacher in a high-need school with a mentor and let them learn on the job rather than with a traditional program."|1
A Manitoba woman has been sent to prison for hiding the remains of six infants in a rented storage locker, but court never heard an explanation as to what prompted her to hide the babies she conceived over many years. Andrea Giesbrecht, 43, bit her lip and looked straight ahead, but showed little emotion as she was sentenced Friday to 8 1/2 years. Provincial court Judge Murray Thompson said Giesbrecht’s moral culpability was extreme and the sentence needed to be strong enough to denounce her behaviour. “These were newly delivered infants, our most vulnerable,” Thompson said in his decision that was livestreamed by Winnipeg media.|1

Nintendo’s ancient Power Glove remains a part of popular culture because, one, it was an epic, ET: The Game-style failure and, two, because it was a power glove. There’s something about the mammalian brain that just likes the idea of being able to reach out and touch a digital objects — that is the point at which virtual worlds could become credible representations of the real world. Still, most attempts to recreate the power glove mentality, to let you use your hands to naturally manipulate digital objects in three dimensions, have been failures.|1

Kids and computers can be a beautiful mix or a disaster waiting to happen . Education-based applications and popular games can give young children the keys to their own success but often they can lead to addictive behaviors that do not help the young person succeed at school as well as at home.

Many of the books and apps we use today were not developed to help the child learn at home or to help him/her succeed at school.|0

When Pacers coach Frank Vogel announced he would sit all five starters for last night's game against the Bucks, it was like a thought experiment come to life. Can a good team's second unit beat the starters of a historically awful team? It was close, but...yes!

Clinton said this week paid family leave is possible by taxing the wealthy but states have done so without soaking the bottom 50% of incomes — which is how she would pay for the program. This is because the bottom 50% don’t see themselves as a group that should be taxed at higher rates and therefore don’t care about a tax on the wealthy. She said the top earners are also exempt because they don’t care about the bottom 50% and don’t care that tax rates are too high.|0

In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don’t report to presidents. In Russia, things are different. Most of those businesses are majority-state-owned corporations, virtual branches of the government. And that means when you talk to the head of a Russian bank or oil company, you are effectively talking to the Kremlin. In 2000, when Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency, he consolidated competing power centers — media, business, local government, opposition parties and the Parliament — under his authority. He called it “a vertical of power.” This system now includes organized crime and cybercriminals.|1

There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams's performances that could, roughly, be called his American and British sides. On the American side, there was the slushy tendency towards sentimentality, for which he became increasingly known, which, at its best, resulted in Dead Poets Society, The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire, and, at its worst, became Patch Adams and Old Dogs. Hollywood has long had a tendency to adopt the finest and most interesting comedians and then determinedly blunt the hard edges that make them interesting. Along with Richard Pryor, Williams was the most obvious example of that.|1

Although state trademark registration offers fewer benefits than trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, state trademark registration can be a cheap alternative for securing limited trademark rights. Federal trademark registration can run anywhere from several hundred dollars to $3,000, depending on the type of mark being registered and the amount of attorney's fees. On the other hand, many states charge less than $100 to file a trademark application. Keep in mind that state registration will not offer multi-state protection, nationwide priority status, incontestability, a presumption of validity or the ability to file a trademark on an intent to use basis.|1

AMD's Ryzen CPUs offer some of the best bang for the buck, but which is best? AMD knocked it out of the park with the first and second generations of its Ryzen CPUs built upon the Zen and Zen+ architecture. It certainly helped wash away the taste of its less-than-stellar Bulldozer chips that launched in 2011. Ryzen provides far better per-core performance, power efficiency, and support for more modern technology. But that makes it harder than ever to decide which one to buy. The Ryzen family is broken into four distinct branches, targeting the entry-level, mainstream, performance, and high-end enthusiast sectors of the market.|1

These fields, which are extremely close to those created by the atomic force, have an impact on matter that is invisible to the naked eye. These magnetic fields affect matter in a manner analogous to those created by radio waves in the human body.|0

My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors . In this article I describe a method that takes advantage of this difference to build an artificial neural network with the same structure and functionality as our neurons but whose input is a new type of information, a pattern of DNA sequences (RNA). These RNAs act as artificial neurons and allow for a new kind of artificial learning, called genetic machine learning , or simply genetic algorithm. Using this method I have been able to create artificial networks that are more accurate and powerful than any previously described neural network .|0

Producer Martin Swope added the tape effects that lend the band its dreamlike, blurred-around-the-edges sound."|1
Under Trump, presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor. Since discovering that the constitution gives him the somewhat controversial power to absolve criminals who are also his friends, Donald Trump has pardoned more people and commuted more sentences in his first 18 months in office than any of his three immediate predecessors. The pardoning spree continued on Tuesday, as Trump issued two more before jetting off to Europe to stomp all over NATO, this time clearing the names of father-son arsonist duo Dwight and Steven Hammond, Oregon cattle ranchers whose 2016 fight against the federal government became a conservative cause célèbre.|1

"Before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married, the tabloids floated a strange rumour: the couple might elope. Would they run off to Jamaica? Hawaii? Toronto? Would they decamp to the Okavango Delta in Botswana, where the howls of exotic animals would greet a small gathering of family and friends as the young couple held hands before a vegan minister, swapping vows in the crackling glow of a union pyre as flames licked the sky and village elders blessed guests before the yoga-safari reception? It was not entirely clear. Opinion | Vinay Menon: Forget Frogmore Castle: Come back to Toronto Harry and Meghan!"|1

In the age of Instagram, food is no longer designed to just be food. It’s a set piece, a lifestyle statement of fantastical hyperbole. So we drink unicorn lattes, eat rainbow bagels, and lick our charcoal-black soft serve in front of neon signs. Food is no longer about eating. It’s about the documentation of unattainable perfection, catching the next ever-illusive meme. Yet in this new wave of food-as-influencer, there is a single, curmudgeonly brand that insists on photographing its dishes on conference room tables, under fluorescent lighting, and from all sorts of unflattering angles.|1

The AKP should take comfort in its large majority and start to view minority views and even peaceful dissent benignly. The outcome of Turkey's latest general election - voters have gone to the polls twice in the last five months - reveals important insights into the nature of the country's democracy and the preferences of its citizens.

Coleman, like many child actors, had a very sad and tragic life. After ""Diff'rent Strokes"" ended its successful eight year run, Coleman sued his parents for misappropriating millions of dollars in his trust fund."|1

The Scimitar-horned Oryx no longer lives in the African desert. It is considered extinct in the wild. But this lovely-looking Ungulate hasn’t been completely wiped out because they can still be found at zoos around the world.

In 60 games with the Spinners, the outfielder hit .296 with seven homers and 19 stolen bases, and his five-tool potential helped him quickly ascend up everyone's list of top Red Sox prospects.

Two years ago , Red Sox prospect Ryan Westmoreland seemed to be on the fast track to the majors . In 2011, Red Sox minor leaguer Ryan Westmoreland went 5-for-5 with a pair of doubles, a double, and two home runs as the New Hampshire Fisher Cats beat the Vermont Fisher Cats 6-4.

Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the hard work required to maintain it. Amid the hubbub of shopping centers and the din of traffic from nearby Hwy. 61, the cemetery sandwiched between McDonald's and Tires Plus seems jarringly out of place. Few pause to notice the prim patch of well-tended green, bounded by an iron fence, that holds some of Cottage Grove's earliest pioneers.

For decades, aid groups have assumed they know what's best for refugees and the poor; a growing body of evidence suggests they're wrong. Both academic research and practical experience, such as with the mass of Syrians fleeing civil war, shows that simply handing out traditional relief goods may not be the most effective way of helping the dispossessed. Aid agencies are tentatively also giving away cash and letting refugees decide for themselves what they need. While the results may be unexpected, the money is being wisely spent and rarely wasted - contrary to old prejudices among donors.|1

Both are looking for new general managers, and Jason McLeod, the Cubs’ top scouting and player-development executive, already has been linked to both.

In a democracy , it is said , we get the government we deserve . The same can be said about the political parties. These parties are not responsible for the poor performances of their candidates.

When Pacers coach Frank Vogel announced he would sit all five starters for last night 's game against the Bucks, many questioned the decision and the need for the bench.

The battle over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s new “borrower education tool” unveiled earlier this week is heating up, with the National Association of Mortgage Bankers now joining the Mortgage Bankers Association in calling on the CFPB to take the “Rate Checker” online tool down. The CFPB’s new interactive page has come under fire because it mentions rates and costs without including disclosure items that TILA-RESPA rules mandate for borrowers – annual percentage rate, closing fees, etc. “This tool will do nothing but confuse consumers in their shopping experience,” said John Councilman, president of NAMB.|1

He stood out with his solid physique, and soft intense face. However, the moment he spoke, his struggles became obvious.

An extra $190,000 in state special education reimbursement funding that came in late last month has helped the town pay off its nearly half million-dollar settlement with the district's bus drivers union, officials said this week.

The additional special education money, part of the state's circuit breaker program, will prevent the town from having to carry the debt over into fiscal 2012, officials said.|1

Judy Watson watched as the California Poppy Reserve was established in the 1970s just five miles from her home . Her family had recently moved to the area to start work on a new development project. The Poppy was the result of a government-sponsored effort to cultivate a rare native plant.

Watson, an avid gardener, joined the reserve to learn more about the plant and its uses.|0

Sanday , a Scottish island inhabited by only six people , has just got its first road – an unpaved road that will cut the island off from mainland Britain . But it hasn’t just got off the island. It’s got a whole bunch of cars, vans, trucks, buses, lorries, trains, bikes, pedestrians and cyclists on it as it crawls over the hills and tumbles around the narrow valleys into the sea. Now that’s something you might think would be impossible, but it isn’t. And the island itself is not the problem.|0

There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams 's performances that could , roughly , be called his American and British periods. His British period was in the 1960s - the period when he began his transformation into a more popular star as a child actor and, with his first hit film The Little Mermaid, his first American period was in the 1970s. His American period began in the 1980s and his British period in the late 1970s and early '80s. Williams himself said it was a difficult time. He was still trying to figure out what to do for his career and was struggling with his acting.|0

I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad ’ s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should be arrested. This was followed immediately by a call from a leading American Muslim woman to arrest the Muslim Mayor of Seattle.

This is the first time I have seen an American Muslim call to arrest a public official as a protest against American Muslim leaders.|0

Boulder has sued the fossil fuel companies. Probably 15 percent or so of us would be alive today without fossil fuels since without them we would be living in the Middle Ages without medicines, electricity, real sanitation, etc. Those of us who did not die in childbirth or by an infection caused by a scratch could enjoy living a short life behind an animal pulling a wooden plow. Maybe it would be best if we recognize that fossil fuels had their role, evolve our power supplies to renewable, storable resources, and stop demonizing everyone.|1

Although there’s long been a debate over the accuracy of health information online, many U.S. Internet users aren’t hesitant to use the Web when they want answers to health-related questions.

"John Bennett(July 20), a teacher at Westside Middle School, was upset by the School Board's decision to have teachers teach all sides of any controversy. He is right, of course, that pretending all sides of any controversy are equally valid is nonsense. But a good deal of the issue hinges on our definition of ""teaching"" a position. If ""teaching"" means that the teacher merely presents all sides of a controversy as though they were equal in weight and legitimacy, then we are being equal time indoctrinists."|1

The Irish airline was recently hit by a fall in traffic after pilots and cabin crew in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Portugal went on strike. Ryanair has also been forced to lower fares for the third quarter of the year (particularly for the October school half-term holidays and Christmas) as customer confidence has been affected by fear of further strikes.|1

New research released today from the Geena Davis Institute at UCLA shows that there are at least a dozen more actresses under the age of 35 who have gone to Hollywood to work for one of the major studios. They are not the stereotypical Hollywood princesses of yesteryear - but they have more in common with the type of women you are unlikely to find in a 1950s Hollywood musical than a 1950s Hollywood movie. They are women in the business of Hollywood, not in the film industry.|0
For three turbulent centuries, the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into the hearts of medieval Europeans. Indeed, the Viking Age, from A.D. 800-1100, was the age of the sleek, speedy longship. Without this crucial advance in ship technology, the Vikings would never have become a dominant force in medieval warfare, politics, and trade. With their invention of the longship, the Vikings spurred a literal sea change in medieval European affairs. The drekar, or dragon-headed longships, were stealthy troop-carriers.|1

Last week , we learned that the Obama administration is considering other alternatives to stop foreclosures . Today , we learned that the administration has decided to use government agencies rather than private banks to assist with the process. What would this mean? Well , it means that foreclosures have been allowed to continue for the most part while the banks were making large profits. Now that they are no longer making as much money, the government is in the process of getting involved in the foreclosure process once again. As we previously wrote , the government already has the power to seize property from people that it deems to be in default.|0

Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the need to preserve their integrity and value. They represent two of the county's wealthiest and most iconic cemeteries. Washington County has more than 100,000 acres of land. Most of those are used for farming and grazing, as well as for hay fields, and for hunting. Washington County's largest cemetery is the Evergreen Cemetery, which was founded in 1883.

"Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “ Thank You ” rally was the crowd ’ s chant “ we need a police chief ”

This year the “ police chief ” chant was used by Occupy activists to express the anger and rage they felt at the actions of police. This year the chants also came to symbolize Occupy protests. The chant of police chiefs is actually quite common in protest songs, and usually means to ask that they be replaced by the people who actually are in charge. Many protesters chant “ we need a new police chief ”, however there are exceptions to this."|0

American troops may have finally left Iraq, but for that nation's citizens the war is only getting worse. More than 700 people, mostly civilians, were killed in violent attacks last month, making it the deadliest calendar month since June 2008. Nearly all of those killed were attacked in the capital of Baghdad. The sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims has escalated in recent months, and the minority Sunnis have turned up the protests of the Shia-led government—leading to violent confrontations with police.|1
( CNN ) — Portuguese sailors called it the `` Gates of Hell . '' Namibia 's Bushmen speak of it as the `` gates of the underworld.'' For more than a decade, the Portuguese-built port city of Oporto has remained a secret from outsiders — even its inhabitants. The city is home to one of the world's last indigenous cultures. While many Westerners live in cities far away, their descendants are drawn to this remote, mysterious community, where poverty is rampant.

In recent years, platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their artistry. For the generation of designers who grew up playing “Super Mario Bros.” platformers offer a sound formula. Though the goal of such games is usually to get from one area to the next, that framework supports copious possibilities. Determining how a character moves through a world and what sorts of things should impede or assist in the process allows plenty of room for creativity. It is why games like “Journey” and “Inside” can both be constructed around jumping avatars but otherwise appear quite distinct.|1
Plushenko’s glorious career was finished. He had hoped to cap it at home after a comeback from spinal surgery, which he did, partially, by helping Russia win the team competition. But his 31-year-old back, after all those years of wrenching revolutions and hard landings, gave out two nights too soon. In essence, Plushenko sacrificed his chance at another individual medal to put his country on top. He was a longshot for gold, but in a sport of sequins and stuffed animals, he brought pugnacious sizzle. He was the James Cagney of the ice.|1

If it’s about a woman who has superpowers and can control the minds of other people, then I really can’t really care. It’s the same story all the way.

"It has seemed for a while as though the global financial storm was going to deal a mostly glancing blow to the entire global economy. For all its talk of a ""Great Recession,"" it has been all but impossible to predict which countries will go into recession. This has been true for many years now. It is most likely that the global economy will remain in the black in the months and years to follow, as it did for a few years prior to 2008 and has been for nearly a decade now, but with an increasing number of countries in the process."|0
"The hyperloop train is leaving the station – and the UK must be on it | City A.M.
Steve Norris is former Conservative transport minister. Britain can reasonably claim to have invented the railway. Stephenson’s Rocket represented the pinnacle of British industrial-era innovation. The ability to move products and people by steam locomotion had a transformative effect on society. British ingenuity saw railways knit communities together across the country, and eventually the globe. And for the next couple of centuries, little changed. The same techniques are being used to maintain track now that were used in Stephenson’s time."|1

Millions of refugees have fled their homes in war-torn Syria since 2011 . President Barack Obama previously planned to resettle 10,000 over the next year. But following the massive terror attacks in Paris over the weekend where at least 129 died, many governors and legislators — mostly Republicans — have called for Obama to rethink the resettlement strategy. Delaware is one of at least nine states to openly welcome the idea of refugees, despite an avalanche of largely Republican governors opposing. According to a count by Vox , 25 governors have said they would bar admission of Syrian refugees to their states and 15 governors said they still support resettlement in their states.|1

French President Emmanuel Macron wants to invigorate the European Union as a global power and spurn the populist nationalism that threatens to undermine its success. But he knows it requires cooperation with the United States—which makes his strange bedfellow in the White House so crucial to his agenda. This piece originally appeared in the Washington Post. Macron, who at 40 is three decades younger than Trump, disdains the president’s abrasive nature and many of his policies, notably on Iran and climate change. The French president prefers books, ideas and lofty intellectual conversation to the aggressive transactional style embodied by Trump, who favors television over written text.|1

CINCINNATI -- As FC Cincinnati fans chanted and cheered for taxpayers to help fund a Major League Soccer stadium , an officer in full uniform with no visible weapons walked in the direction of the crowd. The officer, who did not identify himself, then stepped into the center circle and took his place behind the goal line. For those in the stadium, this was a scene from another age. The officer's presence in front of the goal meant that fans who thought they could avoid paying his $300-a-year salary by not showing up at all were in for a rude awakening.|0

"The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep . That is the provocative implication of a report last month issued by research firm Roubini Global Financial Markets. The report, published by the International Monetary Fund, found that the number of employees in the labor force who were sleep deprived doubled from 10 percent of the population in 1990 to 22 percent by 2012. And that may be because of the aging of the country's population, the report warned. ""When you reach a certain age your ability to work increases sharply,"" said Robert Brulle, the author of the report."|0
Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child’s play, thanks to MIT. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a parser that imitates kids’ learning processes by observing the environment and making connections. The system studies captioned videos and learns to associate words with objects and actions. When given a new sentence, the parser can accurately predict its meaning—without visual clues. This “weakly supervised” approach, which requires limited training input, could expand the types of data and reduce the effort needed for training parsers. Annotations can certainly speed up the process, but they’re not needed to learn.|1

The Volstead Act was repealed on this date in 1933, returning control of alcohol to the states, and it was a happy day at the F.X. Matt Brewery. UTICA, N.Y. -- A total of 85 years ago Wednesday marked the end of prohibition, which meant legally drinking beer again. And for the Matt family from Utica – that meant getting back to selling beer again. They let customers and suppliers know that at midnight, they could deliver, buy, and drink beer at the brewery once again. The local business managed to survive 13 years.|1
Gotham is dealing a familiar Joker in Season 2 . Seemingly confirming what the Fox drama ’ s showrunner Bruno Heller and executive producer David S. Goyer have been saying about Gotham since its debut in October 2015 , it’s going to take a new look at the crime boss. There’s no word yet on whether Gotham will be based in the ’ 90s, which may explain the use of a Batmobile as the symbol for the city’s Batman . But Heller told Entertainment Weekly: “We’re looking forward to going back to our roots in a fun and dynamic way.|0

BOB Cole died yesterday. Around 2pm in a purpose-built flat on a Swiss industrial estate outside Zurich, he said goodbye to his friends, and went to sleep for the last time. He was 68, terminally ill, and was taking his life into his own hands, as around 30 Britons do each year at the Dignitas. His wife, Pam, was one of them. She was suffering from progressive supernuclear palsy, a fatal brain disease, and faced a terrible death.

The movement is a global phenomenon – but here it has stalled before even getting started. RIDESHARING SERVICES WHICH supporters claim could spare Irish cities from gridlock are being effectively locked out of the country on the grounds of breaking taxi laws. Transport officials have recently questioned one of the industry’s newest entrants, a carpooling app backed by entrepreneur and Dragon’s Den investor Sean O’Sullivan, on how it fits within rules that have already seen similar operators abandon the market. But Cork-based startup Carma Carpooling claims it is only promoting the kind of ridesharing setups neighbours and colleagues have been doing for decades.|1

"This week, in a closed-door meeting of Congressional Democrats with President Obama, Representative Ed Perlmutter of Colorado bluntly said what has been on many politicians' minds: ""Larry Summers. Bad choice."" Mr. Obama was visibly annoyed and mounted a defense of Mr. Summers, his former economic policy adviser who also served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Summers, who the president said had become something of a ""progressive whipping boy,"" appears to be a strong contender to succeed Ben S. Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve."|1
Four detection stations throughout the Large Hadron Collider will help gather huge amounts of information about what happens during each interaction of protons and electrons. This information can be used by particle physicists at Cern, the European particle-physics laboratory near Switzerland, and other laboratories to study the fundamental forces of nature. To help the detectors collect this kind of information, the experiment is using a new particle accelerator known as a superconducting solenoid. A solenoid is a large magnet that can be moved to place the particle detectors anywhere on its surface. Each particle detector has its own coil, and each coil has a magnet placed on it.|0
The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has proposed to ask some insurance companies to mandatorily list on exchanges based on the number of years they have been in business. In a discussion paper on listing of Indian insurance firms, Irdai said it would direct general insurers (including health and reinsurers) to take steps to get listed after they complete eight years of operations. This will also apply to all life insurers that have completed 10 years. Irdai said firms that have already exceeded these criteria must list within three years from the date when the guidelines are issued.|1
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Democrat John Edwards endorsed former rival Barack Obama on Wednesday, a move designed to help solidify support for the party’s likely presidential nominee even as Hillary Rodham Clinton refuses to give up her long-shot candidacy. The endorsement came a day after Clinton defeated Obama by more than 2-to-1 in the West Virginia primary. The loss highlighted Obama’s challenge in winning over the “Hillary Democrats” — white, working-class voters who also supported Edwards in significant numbers before he exited the race in late January. He said Obama “stands with me” in a fight to cut poverty in half within 10 years.|1
A pair of districts in the Midwest will add Muslim women to the ranks of the US Congress for the first time, CNN has projected. Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party’s nominee, will secure their respective seats in strongly Democratic districts following primary victories earlier this year that effectively decided their races. Omar, in addition to being one of the first Muslim women in Congress, will also be the first Somali-American member. She came to the US more than two decades ago as a refugee. Tlaib actually campaigned with Omar ahead of the latter’s primary race earlier this year.|1
It has seemed for a while as though the global financial storm was going to deal a mostly glancing blow to the technology industry. Everybody hurts when markets go into free fall (and, as we're writing this on Wednesday afternoon, the Dow Jones has just closed down another 189 points -- although, as always, it could be up 500 points again by the time you read this). But if Wall Street and the banking sector are having a tornado rip through their gilded trailer parks, tech has, thus far, mostly just experienced some rain and a few gusts of wind in its relatively quiet suburb.|1
Many Alberta small-business owners, who have been struggling through a prolonged economic downturn, are hoping the next provincial government will bring relief through business-friendly policies. The Alberta election is April 16 and polls suggest that Rachel Notley’s ruling New Democrats will be replaced with Jason Kenney’s United Conservatives, which have campaigned to scrap the carbon tax and loosen some labour rules that have driven up business costs. Over the past two years, small-business confidence in Alberta has reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the country, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which has been tracking the measure for about 20 years.|1

For three turbulent centuries , the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into the minds of sailors and pirates everywhere, and this fear was only increased by the discovery of a square rig by the Venetian galleys of the 15th century. And so it went from the time of Columbus down to our own time, and so it goes on, and so it goes in other parts of the world too. And so it happened that at a meeting in London of the Society of Antiquaries, in 1854, there was a special meeting to consider the history of square sails.|0

The first image of Earth from lunar orbit. Before an Apollo-era NASA could launch a few humans on top of a rocket and plop them down on the moon, it needed to find safe places to land. So from 1966 through 1967, the space agency launched five spacecraft, which it creatively named Lunar Orbiters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Lunar Orbiter 1 was the first to swing around the moon. It automatically took film photos, processed and scanned them, then beamed the images back as radiowaves to receivers on Earth, where technicians recorded them onto analog data tapes.|1

Cryptocurrencies, outside of Bitcoin, have failed to garner much attention from buyers, and while the same can be said of sellers, the digestion of losses over the past month is likely to lead to more losses soon. Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin are all carving out a similar bear-flag pattern that should lead to another purge of speculative excesses. Weak price action in ETH/USD has it set up to make another leg lower soon. It could continue to drift ever-so-slightly higher, but the developing bear-flag implies risk is skewed more heavily towards the downside.|1
Labour leader Ed Miliband doesn't have an image problem, he has a policy problem. The problem is he doesn't have any, or at least policies that answer the gravity of the situation. Millions of people suffer as inflation outstrips wages. The cost of food, transport, fuel and housing skyrocket. A million people have visited food banks. This is not only a joyless recovery, for the vast majority of people it's a moneyless one.

One 15-year-old girl from Russia loved sharing her image on social media.

Moments after she told her relative to “be afraid of nothing in life,” the train slammed into the teenager and left her body “cut to pieces” in the devastating aftermath.|1

Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because the government has decided that the costs are too great, and that it doesn’t make financial sense to provide the benefits for those already financially well.

According to a story in the Financial Times, the British government has decided that there is simply no economic logic for doing this.|0

Nonetheless, an appeal might be successful if an employee is careful, thorough and able to strike the right notes. Appeals take numerous forms. Following is a summary of different groups of employees and how the processes may differ.|1

The feud between California and the Trump administration grows as the president visits the California-Mexico border to inspect wall prototypes.

Last week, while visiting Sacramento to announce a Department of Justice (DOJ) lawsuit against California’s policies that protect immigrants from deportation, Session addressed the Oakland immigration raids. “Those are 800 wanted criminals that are now at large in that community,” Sessions said.|1

In the age of Instagram , food is no longer designed to just be food . It ’ s a social platform where you can share your thoughts on what you’ve just eaten with people you care about, all in an attempt to get them to eat healthier. It might be because Instagram is a lot like food too. As someone who’s done a lot of research into how food can affect your mood and body, you might be more than a little worried about what Instagram food posts are really saying.|0
To any objective observer , the consensus that exists between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the fundamental issues of the day – economics, foreign policy, national security, and social policy – does not necessarily mean that Romney is the candidate who is uniquely qualified to succeed President Obama at the head of the Democratic party. It is true, that Romney has some specific policy initiatives he has promised to accomplish. However, on the fundamental issues, it is unlikely that any Democrat can be described as the one candidate that can win the party’s nomination to the Oval Office with a mandate from the American electorate.|0
Oh, how the mighty ’do has fallen!

Weather Underground on the Weather Channel: Highly gender-normative interactions. The lady sits behind the bar when the men are talking. This week the Weather Channel, mainstay of bored insomniacs and families on vacation in Florida, debuted a new weekday prime-time live show about the weather.

"Surgical Strike Day : State Education minister Partha Chatterjee yesterday criticised the central government alleging that the UGC 's direction to ban cow slaughter had been imposed on him at his own ""will and convenience"" on the ""basis of his personal opinion"".

Promises to replace houses sold off under the Right to Buy scheme look increasingly hollow as the Government slashes council houses' sale price to a third of the cost of replacements. The Government is now selling off council homes at an average price of £59,000, down from over £80,000 before they came to power, a BuzzFeed analysis has shown. The government is selling off the country's remaining council homes at lower prices than ever before despite a soaring housing market. Social tenants have had the 'Right to Buy' their homes at a large discount since Margaret Thatcher introduced the policy in 1980.|1

This is n't just a museum ; in 2005 , the Knesset ( Israel 's parliament ) passed a law that banned all forms of animal testing, and it's also banned by the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ).

I'd rather that it was enforced and that we can all know what we can and can't ingest, drink, smoke , and eat, but this is not to be the norm.|0
Jack Kerouac cruised the bohemian North Beach neighborhood here in the 1950s intent on achieving nothing less than freedom of expression, an expression of his own individuality, as expressed in The Subterranean Forest, The American Scene, and The Joy Mountain.

French President Emmanuel Macron wants to invigorate the European Union as a global power and spurn the populist nationalism that has swept much of Europe in recent years. But with many of the European Union’s 27 member countries lagging in terms of productivity growth, Macron has also come under pressure from the European Commission to step up the debate about the euro. The European Commission’s budget is €15.4 billion ($19.5 billion) a year, up from €12.4 billion a year under the last government, and the EU has yet to reach its 2 percent target for economic growth.|0

Promises to replace houses sold off under the Right to Buy scheme look increasingly hollow as the Government slashes council tax payments to councils which have promised to replace houses lost to the scheme. In a move criticised by campaigners, West Lothian Council has scrapped its own Right to Buy scheme, promising to replace its lost properties with cheaper houses from a public tender. The announcement has been greeted as “a step in the right direction,” however campaigners say that the money being taken away from the council is nowhere near replacing the money the council has spent on the scheme so far.|0
Black Starlets coach Samuel Fabin says his side were not threatened at any point in their convincing win over India in their last game group at the ongoing U-17 FIFA World Cup. Ghana impressively saw off host nation India 4-0 in their last match of Group A at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi on Thursday. A brace from captain Eric Ayiah and substitute attackers Richard Danso and Emmanuel Toku were enough to send Ghana through to the next round as group winners. And in coach Fabin's post-match interview, he expressed his surprise at the lack of fight from his opponents despite winning raves of admirers in their opening two games.|1
Fish oil. Protein shakes. Vitamin D pills. The packages look alike. Does it matter which you buy? It certainly does, according to Labdoor, a four-year-old, South San Francisco-based startup that tests about 50 supplements and energy drinks each month that it buys off retail shelves, then ranks for consumers. What it finds might intrigue you. Vitamin C degrades in water, for example, so any water-based Vitamin C tablets are basically worthless. More than a quarter of fish oil products are rancid on the shelves, even when their expiration date may be two years out.|1

You have to give Square Enix points for honesty ; Bravely Default : For the Sequel wears its primary intentions of making the sequel a more cohesive and complete experience to its predecessor. This is not to be taken to mean that there is not more content to be found in the sequel, as much as there is. The sequel has a deeper level of story and is able to bring a greater range of emotions to its gameplay than the original, but this is balanced with the same level of difficulty. The gameplay is also much more accessible and fun, but the combat mechanics are lacking.|0
The storm we 're bracing for is the type of January variety everyone prepares for : monitor school closings , weather and more. This past week, I saw many parents, teachers, administrators, and children leave their classrooms. They went to work outside. Some children sat outside and read.

One mother told me it was “good for my child to be able to hang out and talk with his friends”.|0

To any objective observer, the consensus that exists between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the fundamental issues of war and peace, Wall Street’s dominance of American life, and fiscal austerity, has been made crystal clear in the two “debates.” In the absence of effective popular resistance to the duopoly of money, the economic and social crisis fails to create a corresponding political crisis for the rulers. As a result, there is nothing important for them to debate. The two titans of America’s finance capitalist duopoly clashed – leaving behind a dull fart.|1

Chipolo Plus is supposedly the loudest Bluetooth item tracker available today , and its chirpy tune can be heard from a considerable distance. The company claims it has tracked over 1.4 million footsteps, and if you're listening to it right now while you walk around your house, the Bluetooth earphones will likely be making plenty of you think you've got a secret spy device. For those that don't feel like spending another minute of their life tracking their own feet, it's probably best to look elsewhere for tracking gear, though chirpy tunes definitely don't make for good spying.|0
"I ’ m still not convinced Foreman is the answer — they ’ d be crazy not to draft a left tackle

by Jim Corbett • Last updated on

I know, it’s funny. I know that I ’ m going to be wrong on this. I ’ m not going to say that it would be the worst draft in franchise history or that it would blow up in the coaches’ faces. All I’m going to say is that I don’t know. I have been around this league, I’ve been following this team since its inception."|0
STARSPORT brings you the latest transfer news and gossip from Upton Park. West Ham have had a club-record £31m bid for Alexandre Lacazette rejected by Lyon. The Sun claim Slaven Bilic will now turn to Christian Benteke as he looks to make a marquee striker signing. The Liverpool flop has scored just 10 goals in his 41 appearances across all competitions for the Reds this term. His reported wage demands of £120,000-a-week could be a stumbling block for the Hammers. Reece Oxford has rejected the offer of a new contract at West ham, claim Sky Sports.|1
JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar : for the first time in four years, two Israeli security guards would be in the same spot to protect a Palestinian man. It wasn’t a particularly contentious confrontation. The two men were walking toward the gates together. A Palestinian man was sitting on a bench outside the Western Wall, talking to his daughter. Another man sitting on the wall was talking to his Palestinian companion. Both men had been talking to each other, but that was where the problem lay.|0

So the latest Star Wars game has made tea-bagging Darth Vader’s smug Jedi son’s face an international sport. There are worse fates than tea-bagging, young Skywalker. Let us show you. Why, he could be a guest star in Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric for example. Or maybe he’s stuck in some horrible, inescapable limbo. And while we here at Kotaku really love Delaware and hope they can take a joke, what we don’t love is seeing one of our childhood heroes at his lowest. He’s transparent, he seems upset—you’re halfway there.|1
Where will he wake up next ? A prison cell ? A tropical hammock ? Or suspended on a cliff with his eyes open and a shark circling below ? No, that's too obvious ! It's not that simple ! I'm sure that if you told him that for a few hours, he'd understand that there's nothing else to do. But it's also not the case that you can tell him to do just anything, even if you feel like nothing else in the world can make it better for his situation. You still need to be sure that it's worth it.|0
A new study for The New York Times reveals that the media pay for the top 200 CEOs is now over $300 million a year – and the total number of newspapers with top-tier CEOs is now over 50. The top 200 CEOs each earned $8.4 million, which is an increase of $1.9 million from 2009. As a group, they received nearly $30 million in total compensation. According to the research, the top 200 CEOs collectively received $2.4 million in dividends in 2010, up from $0.6 million the previous year.|0
Syrian sources said April 14 that the Jordanian charge d'affaires in Lebanon, Hisham Moheisen, who was kidnapped from his residence Feb. 6, had been released in the Lebanese resort town of Shtoura. Monitor Mideast correspondent John Yemma reports that there was no immediate Western or Jordanian confirmation of this development. But several Lebanese media sources reported that Mr. Moheisen had been found -- one saying he was picked up by the Syrian Arab Deterrent Force near the besieged town of Zahle. Jordan has blamed Syria for the abduction. The two countries have had severely strained relations for almost six months and nearly went to war late last year.|1
We've picked our top five favorite trailers from this year's awards show  arguably, more fun to watch than the show itself! The 2013 Spike VGX awards have come and gone. Say what you will about video games award shows  and trust us, plenty of people are  but they do make for an excellent time for developers to show off what they're cooking up across the next few months (or years). To us, at least, it doesn't really matter who wins and loses; the trailers that tease all the hot new games in development are the real prize.|1
"London ( AP ) — An iceberg four miles wide has broken off from a glacier in eastern Greenland and is drifting to the North Atlantic Ocean. Scientists said it could be a threat to the ice shelves that lie on its flanks, but the iceberg has been travelling fast enough to pose a risk to shipping. ""It is a potentially catastrophic situation if the iceberg breaks off. It could collapse the ice shelf and create huge sea level rise and ice sheet instability that could affect thousands of square kilometres of coastline,"" said the National Ice Centre."|0
The European Commission is considering legal action against EU member states to protect farm animals from suffering in hot weather. The Commission wants the EU to take “prompt and concrete measures” to prevent animal suffering during summer months. Commission officials said that this summer’s heat has already been linked to a number of deaths of dairy and poultry farms. According to a report issued by the FAO in 2012, when the weather is hot, about 5% of dairy and 1% of poultry farms in Europe are forced to stop working. The number has grown since then.|0
Beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl is never easy. When they scored 21 points the first three times they held the ball in the second half and took a 33-32 lead, we all thought the same scary movie we’ve seen since 2001 was replaying before our eyes. But this epic brought a different ending. This one saw Foles, a man of faith who wants to be a pastor when he leaves the game, play as if touched by God. He completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.|1
Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “Thank You” rally was the crowd’s silence when Trump mentioned that everyone should come together. The irony being that his campaign has been anything but unifying, which is why his supporters backed him. They’re tired of seeing this country’s demographics being changed, their white privilege being challenged. Unity and inclusion is far from what these people want — even after the election’s over. I left Cincinnati tired and disheveled, but perhaps mostly worried about our future.|1

Akshara Haasan had what you would call a dream debut in Bollywood with ‘ Shamitabh ’ . While the 2015 release of this film turned out to be a mixed bag of box office, critics had mixed reactions to its content and themes. But the film is set to be released on 25th February, 2016. If you are looking for a review of Bollywood debut, Shamitabh is the one you should definitely watch for a review of the film. While the plot of the film may be predictable, the visuals and the acting are not. It is said to be the best new film from the new generation.|0
Northside Step Team performs at Seattle Theatre Group’s Global Dance Party at the Moore Theater. She directs the Northside Step Dance Team in Shoreline, and last year, her team used their dance routine to protest the police shootings of unarmed black people. Step dancing has a rich cultural history. It became popular in the United States in the early 1900s at historically black colleges and universities. But it started even farther back. “It started historically back in Africa with certain tribes using it, and then through slavery as a way of communication, so there’s a lot of call and response,” Darnesha said.|1
"Minister for Enterprise and Commerce , Max Bradford , today rejected claims by the Engineers Union that jobs created by the government's £7 billion Carbon Tax will lead to job losses because of a lack of skilled workers in the construction industry, as part of their ongoing campaign to cut the deficit. Speaking outside his office at City Hall, Bradford criticised the unions' tactics in an attempt to stop the policy from going ahead:

“I believe in the government’s flagship policy of a low-carbon economy. But the unions are wrong. It’s a policy of jobs and growth."|0
The police have uncovered Class A drugs after using its powers of stop-and-search in Central Park. Arrests were made as Cambridgeshire police responded to complaints of anti-social behaviour in Park Ward, with particular emphasis on the park. Police Sergeant Warren Bottell said: “In November and December we conducted two periods of intensive patrolling in the Central Park area.

"MILLERSBURG -- If laughter really is the best medicine, then the people who turned out for the inaugural Standup Comedy Night were served a very healthy dose of humor.

This casual non-competitive event raised $160 to sponsor four aspiring authors to attend the Wayne Writers Workshop at the University of Akron Orrville next April. It was Denice Hazlett's first-time attempt at standup. ""There are a lot of funny people around here!"" Hazlett noted."|1
In a study from 24/7 Wall Street , Leelanau County was named Michigan 's most expensive housing market with a median price of $2.4 million. Detroit was named Michigan 's least expensive housing market with median prices of $1,500 per square foot. In a follow-up report to the original study , the Michigan Department of Transportation said the median price of new homes was actually lower than the $2.4 million reported. The median home price was the highest it has been in 25 years, the DDP said. The DDP report also said that there were more housing units than people in Leelanau County.|0

Four detection stations throughout the Large Hadron Collider will help gather huge amounts of information about what happens during each collision, possibly revealing new information about the basic makeup of the universe. Today was perhaps the most exciting day in a more than a decade for scientists and science lovers around the world. Not since the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke into fragments and collided with Jupiter in 1994 has there been as much news and excitement over a single event in the scientific community. Rather than corresponding to a massive, cosmic event, today’s news focused on the sub-atomic level.|1

It's hard to imagine that 2001: A Space Odyssey would have its incredible cinematic impact without that classical soundtrack. But director Stanley Kubrick originally hired a composer to score the film, only to abandon the score in postproduction. Kubrick tapped Alex North, who had scored a number of classic films, including Kubrick's own Spartacus, to write the 2001 score. Kubrick deemed the score inadequate for the film, and replaced it with the classical musical tracks that are so familiar today. North wasn't aware of the change until the film premiered.|1
The five-storied 'Farhad Mansion ' resembles any other well-maintained house in an affluent neighbourhood of Chittagong city . Yet no one really knows about its owner . The only reason to go inside the house is to view its lavish interior and to get a glimpse of its owner's personal belongings. But that's not all, the house has been turned into a museum by the government to show its rich history of the Bengali society and culture. On one level, the mansion and its surroundings are the work of the government and a few individuals, but there is also a lot of money being spent for it.|0
ORANGEBURG, S.C. — Talk-show host and media mogul Oprah Winfrey has conducted a jailhouse interview with a South Carolina mother who pleaded guilty to killing her two sons. Winfrey went to the jail in Orangeburg last week where 30-year-old Shaquan Duley is awaiting sentencing. Winfrey interviewed Duley’s family in September 2010, a month after Duley suffocated her 2-year-old and 18-month-old sons, then tried to stage their deaths by driving her car into a river. Prosecutors say she killed the children after being badgered by her mother about being a poor parent. Duley faces 30 years to life in prison when she’s sentenced Friday.|1
The five-storied 'Farhad Mansion' resembles any other well-maintained house in an affluent neighbourhood of Chittagong city. Yet no gatekeeper guards any of the two steel gates that lead to the small front yard and the stairway of the building. With the summer holidays, it is not surprising that the ground and fourth floors that house an English medium school are deserted. But even the residential second and third floors show no signs of life. Climbing to the top, the locked grilled-gate to the roof is reached. Standing there, one cannot help but shudder, imagining what had happened there on April 27, 2012.|1
When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher , only the deepest , most corrosive cynicism is possible .

There is always a better than we. I don’t mean that to be an insult to those who have been the victims of injustice , oppression or hate , but just that there is nothing to feel bad for .|0

Let’s dispense with the question of whether Democrat Ralph Northam is being treated unfairly. His grievous political wounds — by Monday, virtually all Democratic Party luminaries in the state and most Democratic presidential hopefuls had called on him to resign — are self-inflicted.

Tactically, in terms of crisis management, that was the right move — own the transgression and say unambiguously that you’re sorry.|1

Former police officer Drew Peterson threw his wife to the floor one night , grabbed her throat and told her to shut up. Now, months later, police are saying they never believed him until they got a confession from him. That's because it wasn't what police originally reported, but the evidence that Peterson's attorneys say was planted in his favor. It turns out they were right about that. Prosecutors didn't have a case to bring. Peterson, 33, told the Portland Tribune after he pleaded guilty that he had gone back to his apartment one night last year to kill his wife.|0
I have written previously about my own pets, and the most common prompt for me to do this has been when my own animals have reached the end of their lives. For me, it has been a type of grief therapy sometimes, with the opportunity to write an obituary for an animal that's been an important part of my life. This week, the good news is that this is not an obituary. One of my two cats, Couscous, has been unwell, but so far, treatment has been successful, so this is a tale about her illness, not about her death.|1

WASHINGTON — Thousands of commuters across the region were delayed Thursday morning by an apparent work action by Metro’s largest union. About 20 percent of bus service was impacted by the “late out,” Metro spokeswoman Sherri Ly said, which meant many buses either arrived late or did not arrive at all across Maryland, Virginia and the District because drivers reported to work well after the scheduled starts of their shifts. Late in the morning, Metro told riders about the delays via Twitter. Many riders had been complaining about missing buses or longer-than usual waits for hours.|1

It didn't have the highest success rate when it came to matches this season, with only Melissa Walsh and John Robertson still together. But the lack of relationships continuing after Married At First Sight hasn't deterred unlucky in love singles, with Channel Nine confirming they have received a record number of applications for next year's season. A network spokesperson told The Daily Telegraph they have received 10,000 applications since the casting call began earlier this month. This is 1200 more than the total number of applications Married At First Sight received last year over a three month period, the spokesperson added.|1
The OLCC is cracking down on marijuana retailers that sell to minors . PORTLAND , Ore. – A rule increasing the age for the sale of marijuana has led to many retailers dropping some of the products they have on offer. The new rule goes into effect on Aug. 15. Oregon will now only sell to those 18 and older to purchase marijuana products under the adult-use cannabis sales laws. There are some retailers that are still selling products with age restrictions or that sell products that they claim can be used only by people 18 and over.|0
When I opened the brown clasp envelope and pulled out the 21-page spiral book , I was startled . Dr. Mathers' handwriting made the book look like something from the 1950s. It was almost the opposite of my own handwriting. The handwriting was stilted, the sentences were small and crammed together, the entire text looked like a cross between a science report and a legal brief , and it made no sense to me at all . The only way I could read the book was as if it were written by a child. So I opened it at random and began reading .|0

The “ digital workforce ” may sound like science fiction , conjuring up images of lines of robots running through offices and meeting rooms. But there may well be digital workers in your organization. We’ve seen it in many places, including hospitals, law offices, universities and government departments. There is a reason that “digital” is such a broad term. Why would your employees be able to work from home? One answer is that many people feel that they “can work from anywhere” simply by using technology.|0
Considering all the comings and goings of people involved in the project , we should be grateful that Bohemian Rhapsody got its own time slot on Fox’s ‘X-Factor’, where it lasted all of two minutes and 35 seconds. As a result of this, it is now one of the few music shows that you can actually sit through without losing your lunch. So we should all be grateful, even if we don’t agree with what we’re hearing. As I was writing this, the song was still playing, so I suppose it’s all good.|0
My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors. For example, consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron, or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one. Each of these cells, (if taken from the same individual) has an identical genome — and yet each is “reading” a very distinct subset of that genome and consequently carrying out very different behaviors. The choice of what to read and what to hide away is made during development.|1

This article has been updated since its initial posting. On April 7th, former President Barack Obama’s attorney general Eric Holder met with a group of Senate Democrats to discuss the Obama White House’s plans for the 2016 campaign. The meeting ended without an agreement on what, if anything, might be done to secure the presidential pardon of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani."|0
Tacko Fall, who stands 7’5″, is unstoppable. Likely the tallest player in high school basketball, he’s always turning heads in the gym. “Everywhere I go, people want to take pictures, talk to me, shake my hand, but I’m getting used to it now,” the Tavares (Fla.) Liberty Christian Prep junior told the Orlando Sentinel last year. Fall arrived in Florida from Dakar, Senegal with little to no organized basketball experience. He has also lived in Texas, Ohio and Tennessee.|1
What 's the difference between bipolar I and bipolar II ? Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that causes significant morbidity and mortality, and is often misdiagnosed as major depressive disorder (MDD). The current classification of bipolar disorders includes two distinct classes: the bipolar I and bipolar II groups. The clinical features of these two disorders are very different, but bipolar II has a much higher risk of suicide compared with the bipolar I disorder that is often diagnosed as unipolar MDD. This article discusses the possible causes that lead to misdiagnosis of MDD with bipolar II.|0
JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar: for more than two decades, women have been making a monthly pilgrimage to pray at one of Judaism’s holiest sites in a manner traditionally preserved for men, and the police have stopped them in the name of maintaining public order. But after a flurry of arrests this fall that set off an international outcry, the women arrived for December’s service to find a new protocol ordered by the ultra-Orthodox rabbi who controls the site.|1
