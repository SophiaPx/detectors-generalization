"Plenty of reasons exist to be skeptical of the 'smart home' in its current form, but Amazon's Echo virtual assistant shows glimpses of genuine potential. Here's why. I roll my eyes at the concept of the ""smart"" refrigerator. I don't need a 'fridge tweet to tell me I'm out of orange marmalade. Smart toaster oven? I scoff. And smart locks on the doors to your home seem like a particularly dumb idea — unless you crave the company of criminals.

Gaza is the world’s biggest prison. Nearly two million Palestinian people are locked up there by Israel’s military blockade. Last year, racist Israel killed over 2,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 547 children. The Pentagon rushed in more bombs when the Zionist state ran low on ­ammunition. Baltimore, similar to Palestine, is under a racist military occupation. The Baltimore police force — the sixth largest in the 26th largest U.S. city — treats Black people like prisoners.

Dublin: Lawmakers overwhelmingly voted on Friday to back Ireland's first bill on abortion, legalising the practice in exceptional cases where doctors deem the woman's life at risk from her pregnancy, as the predominantly Catholic country took its first legislative step away from an outright ban. Exhausted legislators applauded Friday's 127-31 vote, while outside the parliament gates abortion rights activists cheered as they watched the result on their smartphones.

Ken Block makes amazing gymkhana videos. But NSW Police didn't want Ken Block to make this particular gymkhana video — the one you see right up there — in Sydney.

As it was a drowsy Friday afternoon, the junior minister simply made a quick call and renamed his local football team 4.25 Sports Club. This made Sartre look very silly indeed, because the club play all their matches at 4.25pm. In fact every time they play, their fans chant ""Are you watching, Jean-Paul Sartre?"""|1

German imports lead the list by a fair margin, which isn't too surprising. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners on at least $10,000 over ten years compared to a BMW.|1

Brazil is currently implementing the Brasil Sem Miséria programme — a continuation of the successful Fome Zero— which aims to do just that, Marques Porto says. Initiated in 2003 by former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Fome Zero is credited with having taken 30 to 40 million Brazilians out of poverty.

This sent the bulls hurtling downwards, wiping off the earlier gains, as the market ended in negative territory.|1

In the midst of an NFL lockout that has left many teams without pay, it's hard to imagine a more perfect opportunity for brands to use this occasion to engage with the public than by using a controversial moment to speak out on climate change and the economy. The American Association for Marriage says it will introduce a bill next week to amend the nation's constitution to allow same-sex marriage.|0

Be glad you aren't Jim Furyk today. 1. The American team entered Sunday with a massive four-game lead in the race for the 2016 Tour of Flanders. But the German and Spanish teams managed to claw back at least three of those four points on Sunday, and it looked like they were just about to drop out of the race altogether. Now, after an epic battle, they've emerged from a two-day break without a point — but still have a good shot at securing a top-three finish. How did they accomplish that feat? With a big day of racing under their belts.|0
When crews arrived, they saw heavy fire on all floors all the way up, including in the garage and inside the living quarters. Crews had no choice but to evacuate the building immediately because the smoke from the fire could be hazardous for everyone.The building was completely engulfed in flames early Sunday afternoon when firefighters came to the scene to battle the smoldering inferno. The first two floors of the high-end condominium complex were consumed by flames at 5:30 p.m. Saturday, and the three restarts of the complex were quickly engulfed as well, officials said.|0
"When George Orwell wrote â€œ1984â€ he included a vision of the future in which people would converse in a language known only as ""machine speech."" For him, such machines would be able to convey ideas far beyond the physical. In fact, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that this sort of artificial intelligence technology has already come into use in various industries, including health care.

The fourth episode of Aaron Sorkin’s The Newsroom is called “I’ll Try to Fix You.” That may as well be the title of the whole series. Like Sorkin’s The West Wing, the show wants to fix America, this time through the story of Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels), a successful, cynical and bland cable-news anchor who decides that he, and journalism, and yea, democracy, can do better. Which means what? Will’s producer/ex-girlfriend MacKenzie McHale (Emily Mortimer) explains: “Reclaiming the fourth estate.|1

New research suggests mice with induced Alzheimer ’ s-like symptoms had improved cognitive function when given a synthetic estrogen-like hormone, suggesting there may be a biological mechanism. Glycogenolysis occurs in many tissues as the body uses energy to break down food or store energy (e.g., glucose for fuel). A wide range of factors can cause glycogenolysis such as starvation, lack of nutrients, injury, and infection. The main source of glycogen is glycerol, an electrolyte that enters cells via phospholipid channels. Phosphate is also required for the production of citrate, a substance that holds phosphate in place at rest.|0

Circuit ruled Tuesday. In November 2015, WMATA issued 14 new guidelines for acceptable advertisements on its busses and trains.

The first time I heard these verses was in a small storefront church in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember the pastor saying that the Lord had spoken this verse to him, and now he must listen.

That feeling can be even more profound if you take a step back from the real-life situations around you.|0

Ballinhassig 4-17 Castlelyons 1-12: A polished second-half performance powered Ballinhassig to a comprehensive win over Castlelyons in the Cork Premier IHC quarter-final on Saturday evening. Inspired by Danny O’Callaghan and backboned by five members of the Cork intermediate team, the Carrigdhoun side displayed many of the attributes that may see them make a swift return to senior ranks. While the forwards will grab the headlines, it was the performance of O’Callaghan and the solidity of the Blues’ half backline that launched their second-half offensive and a return of 2-11 (2-10 from play) on the scoreboard.|1
I have just been reminded of why I quit financial journalism after 11 years in the saddle, including a spell as a Wall Street correspondent. While the world of finance had its fascinations, I grew increasingly disillusioned by the dominant narrative that it was always about the money, rather than any other considerations such as values and social impacts. They never registered on the radar. That's not altogether surprising, given the testosterone-fuelled dealing rooms and the fact there is very little connection between the decisions of City executives and their impact on ordinary peoples' lives.|1

The life of the mind puzzles poets and neuroscientists who go about mapping it and labeling it, and, in my case, trying to find it. Thought itself is something to ponder in the Irish tradition and so, there are lots of concepts in the Irish language involving the mind, dreaming, and imagination. I'm only a student myself, so many of the nuances will be lost on me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear native speakers offer more sophisticated thoughts on the vocabulary of Irish thought.|1

Less than two years ago, I was seated at a South Atlantic League baseball game (low A ball) between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers — Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were charting the game. As I discussed in this post, neither pitcher seemed destined to make the major leagues. Richards had been undrafted in 2015 coming out of a small college, and thus had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016 and he was pitching well for Greensboro.|1

Part two of Naomi Klein's report on the events that triggered a momentous new kind of politics in Argentina. Up until quite recently, Argentina pursued a policy of official amnesia when it came to the crimes of the Dirty War. Sure, the human rights non-governmental organisations still issued numerous scathing reports, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo still marched and the children of disappeared parents still showed up, from time to time, outside the homes of ex-military figures to throw red paint. But before the Argentinazo, most middle-class Argentinians regarded such actions as macabre rituals from a bygone era.|1

"It's safe to say Cleveland Browns cornerback and ASU alum Damarious Randall wasn't expecting a response like this. After the Warriors advanced to the NBA Finals on Monday night to set up a rematch with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Randall made a guarantee on Twitter: ""If the Cleveland Cavaliers win the 2018 NBA finals I’ll buy everyone who retweets this a jersey...""

A CANCER expert has hit on a way to kill tumours in two hours — using light. The technique involves a single jab with a chemical then a flash of ultraviolet. Cancer cells in lab mice were found to self-destruct, with up to 95 per cent dead in two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed the cells — which he injected with the chemical compound nitrobenzaldehyde — turned too acidic to survive. He said after patenting his “photodynamic” therapy: “There are many different types of cancers. “The one thing they have in common is their susceptibility to this induced cell suicide.|1

"DALLAS - Like many Americans, Martin Jacobson was overjoyed that Navy SEALs had captured and killed Osama bin Laden. But the Dallas resident felt a deeper connection to the men who hunted down the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Decades ago, he was one of them. During World War II, Jacobson was part of elite groups that were predecessors to the SEALs. The secretive force is used to staying out of the spotlight, but it's back in the headlines following the bin Laden killing. ""I'm just proud of the SEALs,"" said Jacobson, 89."|1

Study suggests complex behaviors were handed down for tens of thousands of years. Despite intense scientific inquiry, there has yet to be a clear answer about why. Scientists say it could reflect a wide variety of factors including genetics and environmental exposures. Some researchers believe that certain behaviors evolved over time in response to the environment—for example, the evolution of cooperation among human families. Others speculate that social bonding can help children adapt to stressful situations by sharing their emotions. There's no consensus on what caused some behaviors to become entrenched in humans' DNA, but several theories are under consideration.|0

Led Zeppelin stole from the ‘60s group Spirit? And did “The Voice” steal from “American Idol”? A recent court case has the estate of the composer of “Taurus” claiming “Stairway To Heaven” is in violation of copyright laws. Creatives have been borrowing from each other for centuries. But what constitutes actual harm -- business, artistic, or otherwise? How much of the original art moved to the new effort? This is always the blurry part.

While giant and spectacular circus shows now roam the Earth, it’s good to be reminded how they evolved from what was essentially street theatre.

A search for ‘toxic mold’ will result in hundreds of scary warnings and ‘studies,’ but few are based in science—and many are motivated by profit. Recently a patient of mine was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well documented, but he adamantly denied that anyone had warned him to avoid alcohol. An initial confession of “a few drinks” turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact.|1
Nobody can predict with accuracy when stock markets will end their record-setting bull run.

Everyone knows where and what they were doing when this nightmare called 9/11 happened. Chuck was getting ready for work and I was on the computer watching FOX when those horrible images appeared.

Dundee has long been a city of rich character, great wealth and extreme poverty. If the new V&A can give it a transformational boost, it will be worth every penny. I declare an interest.

The Hashemite Library remained a beacon of knowledge and a destination for readers and intellectuals until 2000, when the number of readers started to dwindle, given the tough economic situation in the Strip.

Guess what? The NBA really is a showbiz affair. Only super-producer David Stern isn’t pulling all the behind-the-curtain strings (otherwise, New York somehow would have won the draft lottery).

And to think: We haven’t even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers. Regrettably, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball.|1

The response to the bombs by the crowd at the finish line was, I think, exemplary. Sure, many people fled from the explosions, and reasonably so.

January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are making progress is because factions with responsibilities for large chunks of the population are willing to compromise if that will help stem the accelerating decline in living standards nationwide.

Using the age-old box-twist folding technique, this innovative standing desk pops up quickly without having to be assembled, and flattens down when not in use with a simple twist and fold action. Not only is it lightweight and portable, but it is also strong enough to hold up to 20 times its own weight—in addition to that, it is also made of a water-repellent and stain-resistant material.|1
There’s a Speed Graphic camera, once standard equipment in newsrooms across the country. You may have seen them in 1930s and ’40s-era movies that featured gaggles of photographers, “Press” placards stuck in there fedora hatbands. Heavy, bulky and requiring light-bulb-sized flashbulbs to shoot at night, a Speed Graphic was the first camera I used professionally, for my high-school yearbook and the paper I worked for part-time while in high school and college. The one in my office used sheet film -- you’d take a shot, pull out the sheet holder, put in another.|1
Relatives of the deceased bravely listened as the circumstances of the deaths were heard in detail. Harrowing details of his brutal beating, strangling and drowning will be heard at a coronial inquest this Sunday into the death of 21-year-old Sharnell McArthur, whose body was pulled from the river Thames near St Pancras last year. His parents said he had just gone on a day away with friends and ended up in the River Thames for a walk. He was taken to hospital by emergency services on Monday night suffering from serious injuries. Mr McArthur is believed to have been killed by a man using a rope and a stick.|0

Indeed, by Sunday, temperatures are expected to be back in the 50s, and then possibly into the upper 70s by Jan. 10. But first, the National Weather Service expects mostly sunny skies and a high of 59 degrees on Tuesday. The front will make its way into Fort Worth mid-day, but likely won’t be felt until the overnight hours, making for a chilly Wednesday wake-up with the temperature hovering just above freezing. Wednesday’s high is forecast for 46 degrees with partly cloudy skies, followed by a low of 28.|1
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio isn’t visiting Israel until August. But that doesn’t mean he can’t hold hands and dance with Hasidic Jews before then. The mayor may not have known all the words, but as the video below shows, he certainly got into the spirit of “Hevenu Shalom Aleichem” and “Am Yisrael Chai” at Sunday’s “Celebrate Israel” parade in New York. He’s hardly the first politician to dance with Chabad — you can watch Texas Gov.|1
"In a rare instance, Dhoni, who was not even meant to be on the field of play, lost his cool and rushed out of the dug-out to challenge umpire Ulhas Gandhe after he flip-flopped on a no ball during the IPL match against Rajasthan Royals on Thursday night. ""He was certainly fired up the way the decision was handled and why it was overturned. It was a lack of clarity, obviously from him and he wanted to get it clarified at a key moment,"" Fleming said in the post-match press conference."|1
The new head of the national children’s hospital board has said it would be “bad business” for the State to allow the main builder of the hospital to step down from its role. The chair designate of the board Fred Barry, who is appearing before the Oireachtas Committee on Health this morning, also said that there was an “underestimation” from a very early stage in relation to what the project would cost, leading to an increased bill of € 1.73 billion up from the estimated € 800 million cost in 2014.|1
Upbeat on their maiden housing project in Cavite, property developer Century Properties Group Inc. (CPG) and Mitsubishi Corp. signed on Wednesday a deal to create a new joint venture corporation that will bring to the property market around P57 billion worth of affordable homes in the next five years. Seeking to cover part of the country’s huge backlog of 6.6 million housing units, the new venture plans to launch about 15 new housing projects equivalent to around 33,000 housing units within the next five years. Each unit will be priced between the P1 million and P6 million range, targeting middle-income first time homebuyers.|1
It's safe to say Cleveland Browns cornerback and ASU alum Damarious Randall wasn't expecting a response like this from his old coach, Jim Caldwell. And it probably shouldn't have come as a surprise. There are a ton of factors that go into an NFL decision regarding a potential free-agency acquisition: salary cap ramifications, market conditions, league security, history in terms of player contracts and the number of available unsigned players. This week, I looked at the salary cap situation for some of the top cornerbacks over the past decade.|0
"WASHINGTON, March 1 - Coming off a year of record-setting $ 1 billion-plus natural disasters, representatives of leading U.S. banks said they are preparing for their biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression.

In a press conference at its downtown headquarters today, Citigroup CEO John Stumpf acknowledged that his bank was ""doing some tough things"" to bolster its credit portfolio."|0

"Seton Catholic ’ s Jenna Barker set a sectional record by winning the 1,600-meter run in 5 minutes, 13.04 seconds’s 7:25.29 to win the 100-meter hurdles race at the NCAA Championships. ""I didn't even think it was possible,'' Barker said after the race. The United States Olympic Committee continues to push back against its critics over the handling of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, with several U.S. Olympic officials arguing the committee did not adequately respond to the concerns of thousands of Americans affected by the devastating tsunami and storm."|0
Arsene Wenger believes the return to fitness of England forward Theo Walcott and imminent recovery of Germany international Lukas Podolski means Arsenal are not under extra pressure to buy another striker in January. The Gunners resume domestic action on Saturday looking to respond from the 1-0 defeat at Manchester United with victory over third-placed Southampton to stay top of the Barclays Premier League. Walcott is set to face his old club following some two months sidelined by an abdominal problem which needed surgery. Podolski, meanwhile, is on course to be available again by the end of December after being out since August 27 with a hamstring injury.|1

Without much fuss or fanfare, but, happily, with plenty of shoppers, Salisbury quietly reopened its central shopping centre last year, after closing in December. While it still has a handful of vacancies, some customers have made their way to the old mall to fill those empty space. It may not seem like there's much time left until the new season starts, but as we head into what will likely be a warm spring, here are four quick tips for keeping your energy up throughout the season. 1.

"Margaret O ’ Brien, 69, moved from Canada to Wolverhampton in 1971, got married, had three sons, and settled into a life of quiet domestic bliss. ""I don´t know why people are upset about my son,"" said her husband. A few months ago, I went to visit the family for lunch. It wasn´t much of a meal because everyone was gone by then. There was food on the table and some plates. My father was eating his lunch while my younger brother and sister looked on worriedly from the corner. They were looking at him like he was crazy."|0
A budget crisis facing the Palestinian government is deepening in the wake of last week's election victory by the Islamic resistance group, Hamas. On Thursday the Palestinian Authority (PA) announced it was delaying payment of January salaries to 137,000 government staff by at least two weeks because of post-election budget problems. The PA needs $116 million to cover the monthly payroll. But after Hamas' election victory last week, Israel said it was suspending its monthly tax transfers to the PA, worth about $45 million, pending further review.|1

To a watching world, the sight of Britain on fire this week has surely been shocking. The looting and torching has revealed an inner-city London, Birmingham and Manchester seldom glimpsed in the England usually offered for export via soft-focus period dramas, Hugh Grant movies or stories on Will and Kate. If the revelation has puzzled outsiders, it has confused Britons no less. The mood here is a mixture of rage, fear and bafflement. Not that we’re not used to riots: We are. England caught fire during that other royal-wedding year, 1981.|1

ANSWER : I will lower property taxes. We pay the highest property taxes in the U.S. I have already done it in the past and that has resulted in a lot of money in my pocket. In addition to tax, there are additional costs related to our infrastructure. That includes things such as roads, bridges, sewers, drainage systems, utilities and so forth. My plan involves reducing the size of government from 10% of the nation's GDP to 5%. I believe this is a very good way to reduce debt and create jobs.|0
"COUNTY and district councillor for Axminster, Cllr Ian Hall, has spoken out on his support for the recently passed anti-discrimination legislation. This came after a series of controversial statements were made in the local press, most notably during an interview with The Independent in August this year.

""We need to work together towards equality but we also need to take care of people who are discriminated against."|0
According to data provided in the World Economic Forumâ€™s Global Enabling Trade Report 2012, the countryâ€™s macroeconomic fundamentals are strong, making it attractive to at least a fraction of the foreign investors concerned over the Euro crisis. The countryâ€™s biggest investment opportunities are in manufacturing, real estate, agriculture, mining, infrastructure, retail, and tourism â€“ areas of investment that are largely untapped given the quantity of FDI seeking attractive international opportunities. Manufacturing is especially attractive to Japanese and Korean firms. Retail is booming, given the rise in domestic consumption.|1

A new logo to help identify how the community feels about the Seminole County school system soon will be developed, using at least one of the top four winning entries in the county's Logo Competition.

This month, Drake finished his residency at the O2 Arena in London. But he wasn ’ t quite there for the filming of'The 20/20 Experience '. It is said that when you’re pregnant, your hormones give you a little boost. Some doctors say that during pregnancy, some of the female hormones (e.g. androgens) help make your unborn baby feel less like an animal and more like a human. This could increase your chance of having a healthy baby. Others say that even after childbirth, your body may not produce enough hormone-laden progesterone to protect your fetus.|0

This past June, the Tacoma Rainiers brought reindeer mascot Rhubarb and local icon “Epic Sax Gorilla” up onto the roof of Cheney Stadium, where the Triple-A club plays, for a routine crowd-pleasing stunt. Also up on the roof was Tacoma News Tribune columnist Matt Driscoll, who recently explained how roof dancing earned both his employer and the ball club thousands of dollars in fines from Washington’s Department of Labor and Industries. But buried somewhere in the pile of public documents I eventually obtained, a single email — from a single individual — helped provide a fuller answer.|1

U.S. government debt yields rose on Friday after the U.S. government said that job creation was stronger than expected in October. The Commerce Department revised up its estimate for the pace of employment growth this year to 5.4 million from a revised 4.8 million, but warned it was still below the level needed to keep pace with growing population and other factors such as the ongoing recession in the European Union. Economists have been reluctant to put too much faith in economic data coming out of the U.S., largely due to uncertainties about Europe's impact on the global financial system and lingering uncertainty about the health of the U.S. housing market.|0

The sad demise of late veteran actor Kader Khan has left a void in the Hindi film industry that can only be tapped by the new generation of star actors.

In a country where there are nearly 10,000 such films annually, there is little doubt that this group will come close to earning a fortune over the next 20 years.|0
Saturday night's game was exactly like Friday night's game for the Amarillo Bulls in terms of score and results, and if they have one more game like it, they'll have no more games.

I want to answer viewer questions again this week, because we're really beginning to have a vibrant, lively discussion about what it's like to work in Hollywood. We wanted to take a look at some common questions and answers from viewers. One of those common questions is if you're a woman or someone who is a trans woman, do you ever feel like your voice has been taken away from you? We had a few readers ask this question as well and they all share similar stories of being fired from roles that they felt were their true calling.|0

From M1917 to M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps are on the cusp of a centennial—the 100th anniversary of the tank in U.S. service. This animated GIF, put together by the folks at partcatalog.com, shows the evolution of the American tank—from the clanky M1917 light tank to the M1A2 Abrams—and shows how the U.S. went from a newcomer to the world of tanks to world leader. The M1917 light tank, for example, was merely a copy of the Renault FT-17. That kind of copycat engineering is an idea that would be unthinkable now.|1

New Zealand’s Abortion Supervisory Committee is appealing a High Court judge’s decision that said there is reason to doubt the legality of many abortions in the country. A registered practitioner may legally perform an abortion in New Zealand only if acting under a certificate approved by two consultants, who are appointed by the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The appeal also argues that the Court made a legal error in concluding that the committee can form its own opinion about the lawfulness of consultants’ decisions to grant or to refuse approval for an abortion.|1

Does the ‘ perfect ’ bourbon exist? In fact, for about 20 years, the distillery has undertaken a process to create an exceptional product.” It is a process that began in the 1980s when it was discovered that many bourbons were made with a higher percentage of corn, rather than grain, in comparison to white or American cask-finished bourbons. By adding cornmeal to the mash, they were able to improve malted barley and give them a deeper color. When the process started going well, so did the production of bourbon.|0

They say they should be free to donate whatever amount they choose, and they are arguing with pastors, writing letters and quitting congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teaching and rejected what has been a favored form of fund raising for decades.|1

As a veteran of the movement to combat climate change, I have been conditioned to expect disappointment. So when, as administration coordinator for Fossil Free Stanford, I was called into the office of the senior assistant to the Stanford University president in early May, I approached the meeting with apprehension.

In less than two hours, the Colorado State Parks and Recreation Department deployed 3,200 emergency vehicles and 20,000 firefighters on foot, helicopter, barge and even boat to tackle the Hayman fire.|0

This was certainly true for many people, and I'm glad it happened.|0

In New York City, there seems to be a growing trend of people taking advantage of this situation by throwing tons of trash at the vehicles around them.

Syria: Why is Assad Advancing? In the Presidential elections held at the beginning of June, Assad was declared the winner with 88.7% of the vote.

Education Week special reports present a unique advertising opportunity as we can customize a number of different campaigns around a single theme. It is no longer possible to limit the amount of information that we know about the consumer, and it seems increasingly unlikely that we'll be able to predict with precision what kind of products people might buy in a particular season. As such, ads which are tailored to specific audiences will have far greater potential to change the industry landscape than campaigns which focus on generic consumers. In the next 10 years, this shift will have dramatic implications for media and advertising.|0
The best element of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film, Split - and one of the few things I've really grown to appreciate in the past two years - is that it wasn't simply a rehash of established tropes.

Instead he went big with this sequel, taking advantage of both its setting and cast to craft something much more unique.|0

L.A. cats are cooler. Nite Jewel + Dâm-Funk = Nite Funk in the citay. There's been movement on the subject for years, so it feels more timely now. It has become a matter of concern to me that people think that cats are cool, when they really don't like cats. They just don't understand them. No, I do not advocate euthanizing cats, because they are a beautiful creature, with very good personalities, and they deserve a chance to live long and healthy lives. But I do have some reservations about the current status of domestic cat care and behavior.|0

RICH KARLGAARD : You should look at 4 areas. One is financial regulations, which still makes it hard for people to invest, and also one is jobs and the ability to create good jobs in the private sector, where there are a lot of people wanting to take advantage of these opportunities that are available to them now. What do you think about what this means for all of us economically? MIKE HENRIQUEL : To me, I'm an economics major. But I've never been a student of economics.

TRUSTEES of Settle's Victoria Hall were celebrating this week after hearing they would receive a grant of more than $50,000 by the Department of Public Health to improve services for the homeless.

Craig Watson ( top ) and Lee Stephenson have been jailed for 21 years combined after an armed robbery on the M1 motorway during the Christmas period. The pair used a knife to take $2,000 from another car, but managed to hold it with one hand. After they returned to their own car, they took a second vehicle, a Ford Focus, and stole money and jewellery including a necklace worth more than $1000.

They show people carelessly crushing the boxes that protect Nike shoes while walking through the outlet, mindlessly grabbing and discarding sneakers as they go.|1
Manatees are large, gray aquatic mammals. They have fat bodies — I believe that “husky” is how clothing companies would attempt to get manatees to buy big jeans — that taper to a flat, paddle-shaped tail. Average adult manatees are about 10 feet long and weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds. Manatees are among God’s ugliest creatures in the ocean, and there are a lot of strange-looking seagoing creatures. Those are facts — well, the ugly observation is an opinion, but it’s obvious enough to be fact — that I learned from the Save the Manatee Club website.|1
Want to end the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the act has metastasized into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has done much to shape the freedom of political debate in the modern U.S. What began as a vague statute that gave President Woodrow Wilson power to jail critics and censor the news media during World War I has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by policing secrets, not speech. Censorship did not end when the war did. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute.|1

Millennials are not a homogenous group of individuals, so a one-size-fits-all marcomms approach won't work. Millennials want diversity and have different values than their parents and grandparents. For most of its history, America's government has been reluctant to take seriously allegations that it has systematically discriminated against African American and Native Americans in hiring. In fact, until the 1970s, all federal employment decisions—including hiring, firing, promotions, tenure, and compensation—were based solely on race. Today, more than two-thirds of American workers receive no paid sick days. For some groups of workers, however, such opportunities are even more limited.|0

Hampton, who needed a medical timeout for a lower back problem before she served out the second set and winced in pain, frequently on the verge of tears, throughout the third, still managed to hit 41 winners to keep the top-ranked Azarenka under pressure. Azarenka appeared frustrated at times, but overcame an early break and fended off triple break point in the seventh game of the deciding set before clinching the match in 2 hours, 9 minutes.|1

Drones come in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes these days, but generally speaking, most of them still fall within one of two categories. There are those of the multi-rotor variety (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc), and those of the winged variety. Both categories have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor aircraft are typically more stable and easy to fly, but also much slower than wing drones that focus on forward acceleration. Conversely, winged drones can fly faster and further than their hovering counterparts, but are harder to pilot, since they can’t perform vertical takeoffs and landings.|1

The best element of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film, Split - and one of the few things it did right - happened at the very end.

The Bible teaches, “Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are led by various lusts (see 1 Tim.3:5-6).

One person has said, “It takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it.” This is a true saying! I believe one of the most important reasons leaders fall is that most have never intentionally set up mental and emotional firewalls.|1

It was a Saturday morning. August. I remember it vividly. I was online, sat up in bed, browsing, not looking for anything in particular. An article caught my eye: it was about the refugee crisis.

In response I expected compassion, a swell of fellow feeling. But my heart sank as I read the comments. There was so much cruelty.|1

He talked about the early days of his career and he even addressed the rumours about him being a culture vulture because he appropriates British and Caribbean cultures.

If this was supposed to be a measuring stick game for the Flyers, they came up a bit short on it. They gave up just five goals over the first four games of the regular season but fell behind 4-0 in their last seven, including a pair of third-period goals late in Game 3. The Flyers had three players score in that span (Brock Nelson and Jeff Carter), while the Wild scored three.

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but also for that reason, an extraordinary case study for evaluating the mandate that should determine the relationship between the National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation. Ideally speaking, the national security set up anchored on Intelligence, exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security –external or internal –with the aim of neutralising it in time. At the same time, however, it does this on the authority of the elected Political Executive that is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy.|1

The first time I heard these verses was in a small storefront church in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember because it was the same Sunday morning that Princess Diana’s tragic death was reported. I had recently left my job on Wall Street and was living in Kiev with my mother after my father had passed away and I was there because I was not having much luck in finding my way forward. I recall the wood-paneled walls of the room where I sat in the back, slightly embarrassed by the evangelical enthusiasm of my fellow expats. But when I heard these verses my wandering mind was drawn back.|1

The response to the bombs by the crowd at the finish line was, I think, exemplary. Sure there were a few boo-boos and hecklers, but more than that they seemed to respond to some of the things we did.

Similarly, based on recent construction data from the same period, Russia places second only to Brazil from BRICS nations in terms of total area.|1

Now the project has been picked up by the Weinstein Company, and though Eminem isn't technically out of the running, he may be on the verge of being replaced by some of the biggest starts out there.|1
To involve private sector in healthcare, what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to reach out to more people. The nation has a new health policy after 14 years.

[Written by Jonathan Starling] It is not unusual to read and hear complaints about the amount of trash talk that the two main parties indulge, a phenomenon which seems to be magnified during election campaigns. And yet, seldom do these two parties actively seek to engage in real trash talk. And by that, I mean talking about trash in the literal sense! And yet the issue of trash and waste in general is one that affects us all, touching on matters of public health, social cohesion and tourism, amongst others!|1

When the theme of the convention seems to have been, “Drill, baby, drill,” which is an energy policy in exactly the same way that, “Tax, baby, tax” is a fiscal policy (i.e., it isn’t), slogans are obviously all that the party has left. Even if you think that increasing oil exploration and supply through more offshore drilling makes sense, you cannot really take these people seriously. Unfortunately, yes you can. This, by the way, was the moment when I completely gave up on the convention.|1

Anyone who’s ever been frustrated at the task of shooting video in low light should be poised to freak out over Canon’s weird and amazing new camera. It’s a video camera that shoots full HD color footage in almost complete darkness. The ‘multi-purpose’ camera, dubbed only MH20F-SH, has a full-frame sensor with 2.26 megapixels. The reason for the meager resolution is because each pixel is very large—19 microns to be exact. That’s 7.5x larger than, say, the pixels found on a flagship DSLR like the Canon 1Dx.|1

The annual meeting of the Kelly Gang is normally a festive affair. The get-together, the brainchild of New York Post media columnist Keith J.

The centerpiece of the rebuild is the warehouse, which was constructed in 1943, according to the date scrawled in concrete. It is made of wood. The roof leaks.

"As a veteran of the movement to combat climate change, I have been conditioned to expect disappointment. So when Donald Trump claimed on Thursday morning that he would not use his authority as president to stop the Paris climate accord — a deal among 195 nations, including the U.S., to limit warming to below two degrees Celsius above preindustrial times — I was disappointed. This isn't the way to get something done.

BASEL, Switzerland – Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG said Monday that it has had reports of 13 cases the H1N1 flu becoming resistant to Tamiflu, which it calls a very low percentage.

And the resistant variety has been like the widespread version of the virus in that it typically produces only mild symptoms. The 13 cases were scattered around the world in Europe, the United States and Asia, said Reddy.|1
`` Of all the German surface warships, the British feared Bismarck the most. Her size, speed, and weapons made her an important contender. She was ordered by General William E.

Multiple bills at the New Jersey statehouse are of interest to truckers and others using roadways throughout the state. Repeat drunk driving offenders could soon face harsher penalties for their actions. New Jersey law now limits punishment for affected offenders to a traffic offense. Bail typically is set at $2,500. The traffic offense designation allows drivers charged with drunken driving to continue to drive while awaiting their court date. Awaiting consideration on the Assembly floor is a bill to end that practice.

Don Draper: Who's crying now? When Jon Hamm last hosted “Saturday Night Live” in January, his monologue traced his supposed pre-“Mad Men” career, featuring clips of him – looking and acting very much like buttoned-down, hyper-self-controlled 1960s ad man Don Draper – in roles ranging from QVC host and to “Def Comedy Jam” comic. “Have you seen them? You know what I’m talking about. Those roundaway girls with their big booties,” a deadpan Hamm/Draper tells the “Def Comedy Jam” audience, clad in a gray suit, scotch in hand.|1

For small businesses that sell on credit, accounts receivable can make up a substantial portion of the balance sheet. Credit card firms typically charge fees for these accounts receivable as well as other types of accounts. In addition, consumers don't always know how long they're paying in advance and it is often difficult for business owners to manage their accounts receivable without having them held over for possible future usage or overdraft charges. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) takes enforcement actions against individuals who use credit card processors to collect, sell, trade or attempt to sell prepaid mobile banking products.|0

If you think Malawi is living the past where your police lied to the country that Robert Chasowa committed suicide when in true sense your party killed him, you are mistakenly wrong.

The likeliest of sources stepped up for the Boston Red Sox on Sunday. David Ortiz, never one to shy away from the big moment, jacked a three-run homer off Joba Chamberlain in the ninth inning to give the Red Sox a 5-3 win over the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. The victory snapped Boston’s five-game losing streak and stopped the club’s streak of seven consecutive series ending in sweeps. Ortiz’s heroics obviously put the Red Sox over the top. But there was much more to Sunday’s win, so let’s go over some notes from the nationally televised affair.|1

When George Orwell wrote â€œ1984â€ he included a vision of the future in which people would converse in a language called. Orwell described Newspeak as “the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year”. Orwellâ€™s idea with Newspeak was to have a world where all shades of meaning were removed from language, which reinforced the total dominance of the State. Calling something one thing when itâ€™s the exact opposite also might be an example of Orwellian Newspeak, like calling a bill full of spending on liberal social programs an economic stimulus plan.|1

THE first acknowledgement of Brent Moloney's redemption for an after-match drinking binge came midway through the season when he was quietly reinstated to the club's leadership group.

Where were you when you received your 40 Under 40 award? It was 2009 and I was in my mid-30s. The only thing that saved my life was an accident on a plane.

I worked so hard to earn that award and it will be the last of my career. That's something I will never forget.

The Internet has changed beyond anything could have foreseen just five years ago. It is no longer a browsing medium: it is full of Web 2.0 applications, real time communications challenges and a whole range of threats that are designed to piggy back on this new usage. As a result, Web security has changed immeasurably - it's no longer enough to block, stop or inhibit IP sessions. Web filtering cannot hope to meet the security challenge. This Webinar will explain how Internet usage has changed and how your perception of IT may not match what your users are actually doing, resulting in your security controls being by-passed.|1

If the U.S. presidential election were resolved on social media, Barack Obama would be the clear winner this year over Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The Obama campaign has embraced social media, with the president holding a huge lead in Facebook and Twitter followers, and the affiliated Democratic National Committee is using private social networking tools to communicate with some campaign operatives. There's also evidence that the Obama campaign has tapped into social media analytics to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of the campaign's messages. Neither campaign, contacted to discuss their social media strategies, returned messages.|1

Did Donald Trump Release Donald Trump’s Tax Return? For a moment, it seemed that Rachel Maddow was in possession of a genuine scoop. And then, all of a sudden, it didn’t….Thanks to MSNBC, the suggestion that Trump has “paid no taxes in 18 years” has now been definitively proven to be false. Moreover, Trump seems to have paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than did most political figures, and to have enjoyed a sizeable income to boot.

"Veteran congressman Jim Leach (R-IA) went down to defeat in the massacre of 2006. I'm no apologist for ""moderate Republicans"" but it is worth saying that Leach was, in my estimation, fairly clearly the best House Republican. Nevertheless, one can only be thrilled with his defeat. That it happened just goes to show how fundamentally rotten the whole GOP scene had become. Leach was, in many ways, a person possessed of genuinely decent instincts and some fundamentally sound ideas about how the United States should conduct itself in the world. Nevertheless, in practice he was useless."|1

First, we looked at which major brands cost the most to maintain over the first 10 years of a brand's existence. For the sake of brevity here, we'll focus on companies that have been with us for more than 25 years or are long-lived.

Dec 25 (Reuters) - The Saudi market fell on Tuesday, as plunging oil prices pressured petrochemical stocks, while Riyad Bank was the top gainer, reaching a four-year high after saying it was in merger talks with National Commercial Bank (NCB). The Dubai index was the sole gainer of the session, inching up on the back of rises in its banking shares, with most major Gulf bourses slipping on tepid global sentiment and weak oil prices. Oil prices plunged to their lowest level in more than a year on Monday, as fears of an economic slowdown weighed on the market.|1
A local state representative is calling for fundamental reform of the state’s standardized testing system after the “litany of errors” he claims plagued the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2016. Isaac believes school districts should be able to choose from national standardized tests as the state fixes the STAAR test. When STAAR was last administered in May, issues regarding test administration, along with lost or late testing materials, glitches that erased test results, and mishandling of students’ private information have come to light, according to a press release.|1
"NEW YORK — A lawyer whose rant against workers speaking Spanish at a New York City restaurant issued an apology on Tuesday. ""To the people I insulted, I apologize. Seeing myself online opened my eyes — the manner in which I expressed myself is unacceptable and is not the person I am. I see my words and actions hurt people, and for that I am deeply sorry. While people should be able to express themselves freely, they should do so calmly and respectfully. What the video did not convey is the real me. I am not racist."|1
Without a doubt, the addiction drama “Beautiful Boy” – not the slasher-flick “Halloween” – is the most terrifying movie opening at the multiplex this weekend. Starring Steve Carell (“Foxcatcher”) and Timothee Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name”), the movie is a chilling and unsettling look at a young man’s plunge into meth addiction (and heroin, pills, pot, etc.) and a devoted father’s efforts to save him. It’s a true and horrifying story so powerful that an uninspired director and clichéd script can’t dilute its impact.|1
Blue Turtle Technologies, South Africa's leading enterprise technology management company, has entered into an alliance with ThreatMetrix to help clients manage their information security and cyber-security needs across multiple verticals including cloud computing, infrastructure management, mobile device management and data analytics. The Federal Reserve will increase interest rates this year at the first opportunity as the Fed makes progress toward reducing its $85 billion in portfolio of securities that must be held for at least 12 months in order to make it sound reasonable to bond investors.

Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner apparently share a ‘ similar ’ due date, following their speculative pregnancies. The two are reportedly due on April 4, 2013, at 10 a.m. ET. If there is one thing Donald Trump will never say out of fear of the consequences, it is this: you can't trust me with nuclear weapons. And as President, he has done nothing to convince himself that any of those options are actually on the table. That was not his argument during his first trip to the Middle East last month.|0
Not only did former BP chief executive Tony Hayward go sailing on his yacht at the height of the oil-spill disaster, but he also spent almost two months in jail as part of an ongoing investigation into whether the oil company was involved in the Deepwater Horizon accident – which killed 11 people off the Gulf coast. On Saturday morning, March 20, 2007, around 5:00 a.m., a white Chevy Suburban traveling southbound on Interstate 75 headed westbound on I-75 northbound came upon a large silver pickup truck that had stopped for fuel. A man sitting in the passenger seat jumped out and opened the vehicle's rear door.|0
"Girls Like Biology, Boys Like Physics? We all have our stereotypes about which subjects appeal more to girls or boys. Well, in perusing a new report on the Advanced Placement program, I was intrigued to discover some hard data to help shed light on the matter. In addition to reporting participation on AP exams by racial and ethnic groups, the College Board's eighth annual ""AP Report to the Nation"" includes the gender breakdown for all subjects tested. The data are for public school test-takers from the class of 2011. Some of what I learned may not surprise readers."|1
With the economy beginning to stall, Ben Bernanke's war on the nation's savers rolls on. A few of these funds even pay juicy double-digit yields — like the one my Permanent Wealth Investor subscribers have earned 20% on in two years. Dividend harvest funds: These funds buy shares in companies that are about to pay a dividend, and then sell the stock after the dividend is paid. By doing this, they can rotate through companies with different payment dates, and thereby achieve a high dividend payout. The problem is that shares generally trade lower after a dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend.|1
Our readers reacted to the U.S. bomb dropped over Afghanistan, the animal featured on the back of the Canadian Maple Leafs sweater. I got my new laptop today and I love it, it is so much faster than what i have before with a Windows 10 PC. Now its time to install Ubuntu 16.04 for Linux! The computer has a dual core CPU and Intel HD 4000 graphics which makes it very fast. It also has Bluetooth 4.0 and USB Type-C ports, but no Gigabit Ethernet. It was a nice upgrade from the original Windows 10 PCs that i used last year.|0

""A few years ago we found out that several Vermont physicians were getting Medicare reimbursements for services that didn't exist,"" said John McElhinney, a professor of public health and director of the Vermont Medical Society's Division of Ethics and Research. ""What do they have to gain if they don't do their jobs?"""|0

The fourth episode of Aaron Sorkin ’ s The Newsroom is called “ I ’ ll Try to Fix You. It's an hourlong look at the real-life failures of public institutions, which seem to have no future. And it’s a story about something far more serious than the state of affairs in public education: A federal court has struck down Arizona's ban on transgender students using publicly funded facilities. The Washington State Department of Transportation plans to add three new toll lanes connecting Interstate 5 and I-5 North to make up for the lost space from Highway 99 extension.|0

A man has been jailed for keeping dogs for fighting at his home in Ayrshire. Tony Barbara, 50, kept the five-year-old tabby German shepherd and two other dogs on a farm in Doonstone, Ayrshire, between 2007 and 2012. Mr Barbara was accused of keeping the cats in a locked cage and refusing them food to drink. In April, he was told they were to be euthanised because he had neglected their care. He refused to speak to officers or take them to see a doctor. He added: 'If I hadn't been so lazy, my dogs wouldn't have been fighting.|0
"Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer wiped the floor with Wall Street's third-quarter estimates, but one comment made by CEO Ian Read at the time raised questions about his leadership. I'm often asked, ""how do you make money?"" And it seems that most people aren't sure what their goal is. It can be challenging to figure out which business ventures are most important to them personally and which ones are a stepping stone for other things. In addition, I've seen some folks get caught up in chasing personal success while not investing in themselves or their business."|0
