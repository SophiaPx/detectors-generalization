For small businesses that sell on credit, accounts receivable can make up a substantial portion of the balance sheet. During the annual audit, auditors will check to see if your claims regarding the accounts receivable balance can be proved. These claims are known as assertions.

First, we looked at which major brands cost the most to maintain over the first 10 years of a car's life. We grouped all years of all models by brand to compute their average cost by brand. In order to estimate annual maintenance costs, we found the amount spent on every two oil changes (as oil changes are generally done every six months). German imports lead the list by a fair margin, which isn't too surprising. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners on at least $10,000 over ten years compared to a BMW.|1

"Veteran congressman Jim Leach (R-IA) went down to defeat in the massacre of 2006. I'm no apologist for ""moderate Republicans"" but it is worth saying that Leach was, in my estimation, fairly clearly the best House Republican. Nevertheless, one can only be thrilled with his defeat. That it happened just goes to show how fundamentally rotten the whole GOP scene had become. Leach was, in many ways, a person possessed of genuinely decent instincts and some fundamentally sound ideas about how the United States should conduct itself in the world. Nevertheless, in practice he was useless."|1
There is no stronger motivation to bury the hatchet than ratings and pending contract negotiations .

( CNN ) - After 8 hours of deliberations Thursday , a St. Louis jury awarded $ 4.69 billion to plaintiffs who alleged BP and other defendants caused the April 2010 oil well explosion and fire that killed 11 people in the Deepwater Horizon. The verdict was the largest civil jury verdict in US history and was more than five times greater than the $ 1.8 billion record set in 2008 in Exxon Valdez oil spill litigation.

According to analysts, the market is entering a consolidation phase after the recent run-up. NEW DELHI: A below-normal monsoon forecast by private weather agency Skymet proved to be a big dampener for stock benchmarks on Wednesday, which surrendered the day's gains after scaling all-time highs.

This sent the bulls hurtling downwards, wiping off the earlier gains, as the market ended in negative territory.|1

Did Donald Trump Release Donald Trump ’ s Tax Return ? For a moment , it seemed that Rachel Maddow was in trouble. In her opening monologue Friday night, the MSNBC host and left-wing activist claimed that the U . S . Federal Election Commission had rejected a complaint from “anonymous sources” alleging that Trump had not paid his full taxes during 2005. But the FEC’s decision had nothing to do with whether the presumptive Republican nominee is telling the truth. And the sources Maddow cited as the basis for her report had nothing to do with Trump’s 2005 tax returns, either.|0

Less than two years ago, I was seated at a South Atlantic League baseball game (low A ball) between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers — Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were charting the game. As I discussed in this post, neither pitcher seemed destined to make the major leagues. Richards had been undrafted in 2015 coming out of a small college, and thus had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016 and he was pitching well for Greensboro.|1

Without a doubt, the addiction drama “Beautiful Boy” – not the slasher-flick “Halloween” – is the most terrifying movie opening at the multiplex this weekend. Starring Steve Carell (“Foxcatcher”) and Timothee Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name”), the movie is a chilling and unsettling look at a young man’s plunge into meth addiction (and heroin, pills, pot, etc.) and a devoted father’s efforts to save him. It’s a true and horrifying story so powerful that an uninspired director and clichéd script can’t dilute its impact.|1
Manatees are large , gray aquatic mammals . They have fat bodies — I believe that “ husky ” is the correct word — with a small head and large eyes .

The Manatee is the only living species of cetacean that is neither fish nor amphibian . This means that it can survive in salt water but also in fresh .

Cancer cells in lab mice were found to self-destruct, with up to 95 per cent dead in two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed the cells — which he injected with the chemical compound nitrobenzaldehyde — turned too acidic to survive. He said after patenting his “photodynamic” therapy: “There are many different types of cancers. “The one thing they have in common is their susceptibility to this induced cell suicide.|1
Drones come in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes these days, but generally speaking, most of them still fall within one of two categories. There are those of the multi-rotor variety (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc), and those of the winged variety. Both categories have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor aircraft are typically more stable and easy to fly, but also much slower than wing drones that focus on forward acceleration. Conversely, winged drones can fly faster and further than their hovering counterparts, but are harder to pilot, since they can’t perform vertical takeoffs and landings.|1

Want to end the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the act has metastasized into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has done much to shape the freedom of political debate in the modern U.S. What began as a vague statute that gave President Woodrow Wilson power to jail critics and censor the news media during World War I has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by policing secrets, not speech. Censorship did not end when the war did. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute.|1

From M1917 to M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps are on the cusp of a centennial—the 100th anniversary of the tank in U.S. service. This animated GIF, put together by the folks at partcatalog.com, shows the evolution of the American tank—from the clanky M1917 light tank to the M1A2 Abrams—and shows how the U.S. went from a newcomer to the world of tanks to world leader. The M1917 light tank, for example, was merely a copy of the Renault FT-17. That kind of copycat engineering is an idea that would be unthinkable now.|1

The best element of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film, Split - and one of the few things it did right - happened at the very end. The brief, surprising reveal of Bruce Willis reprising his David Dunn character from Unbreakable created a shared universe that Shyamalan was all-too-eager to exploit. Unfortunately, there's a wide gulf between teasing fans with a momentary appearance and building a story around it. Glass, the third film in what has become a trilogy, comes across as a mix of half-formed ideas baked into an uneven casserole.|1

"In the lead up to the Super Bowl last week , NFL Hall of Famer Ladainian Tomlinson gave his projection for Super Bowl 50. And by the time the game began, Ladainian had made a few tweaks based on what happened on the field. Here is how he did:

"TORONTO — Businesses are asking for major changes to the King St. pilot project or they ’ ll be considering a “significant loss of sales.“

Those who are against the project argue that the city has been slow to respond to requests from the business community who have a lot invested in the downtown.

Tech execs discuss the impact automation technologies are having on their organisations. For many organisations and their workers, technology automation is an opportunity and a threat. On one hand, using robotic process automation and other tools creates efficiencies by automating manual and repetitive tasks. On the other, it has the potential to make jobs redundant. Tech execs gathered at roundtable events in Sydney and Melbourne recently to discuss the impact automation technologies are having on their organisations. A key issue raised during the discussion was the challenge of ensuring governance policies and procedures are followed as ‘bots’ replace tasks carried out by humans across the business.|1

The General Accounting Office reported last month that the Small Business Administration needs to improve its planning for a new generation of financial products. The GAO also said that it has found that SBA lenders often lack sufficient data on small business loans to analyze market trends. One reason the GAO says the SBA is failing to meet the needs of emerging markets is because it is not providing enough technical assistance. The GAO says that while it has received more than 400 recommendations from SBA lenders on ways to help them improve service, only about 40 percent of these are being implemented.|0

Edgar Wright has never made a bad movie. He’s never even made less than a very good movie, and so it makes sense that thus far in his career, Wright has shied away from straight-up sequels. However, that could possibly change with Baby Driver.

The first time I heard these verses was in a small storefront church in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember because it was the same Sunday morning that Princess Diana’s tragic death was reported. I had recently left my job on Wall Street and was living in Kiev with my mother after my father had passed away and I was there because I was not having much luck in finding my way forward. I recall the wood-paneled walls of the room where I sat in the back, slightly embarrassed by the evangelical enthusiasm of my fellow expats. But when I heard these verses my wandering mind was drawn back.|1

Guess what? The NBA really is a showbiz affair. Only super-producer David Stern isn’t pulling all the behind-the-curtain strings (otherwise, New York somehow would have won the draft lottery). To the contrary, the league lurches along in the manner of an over-budget, out-of-control Hollywood spectacular — propelled by the ego of big-money players, rife with jaw-dropping plot twists, subject to endless rewrites. And to think: We haven’t even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers. Regrettably, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball.|1

To a watching world , the sight of Britain on fire this week has surely been shocking . The looting , the arson , the fear . In the face of this , what must be your first thoughts ? I think that I would say that of course . Of course we have a duty to look after our own . But I’m not sure that that duty would be quite the same if it were being done by someone else . Perhaps I would be more willing to accept that there are some people who should not be in this country , or have a right to our help .|0
Baceapp Corp. and LightSpin Technologies will move to BU 's Engineering and Science building . Two companies plan to create a spinoff from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), a graduate school that has been working with them for the last three years.

Really ? Was it this complex ? The Green Bay Press-Gazette reports that authorities say they are two to three weeks away from identifying exactly what it was. I'm not an expert, but I've never heard of that. I didn't say they thought he was guilty. I said they have a strong case and they are very confident that they will get the right guy. They don't need an expert to know that, I think. And if they know, how can they say that they are not sure about what it was ?|0

Manatees are large, gray aquatic mammals. They have fat bodies — I believe that “husky” is how clothing companies would attempt to get manatees to buy big jeans — that taper to a flat, paddle-shaped tail. Average adult manatees are about 10 feet long and weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds. Manatees are among God’s ugliest creatures in the ocean, and there are a lot of strange-looking seagoing creatures. Those are facts — well, the ugly observation is an opinion, but it’s obvious enough to be fact — that I learned from the Save the Manatee Club website.|1

It 's been more than a decade since Eminem 's one and only starring role in 8 Mile , and even longer since he 's made a full-length movie, but he 's back, this time behind the camera and directing.

New research suggests mice with induced Alzheimer ’ s-like symptoms had improved cognitive function when given a synthetic estrogen-like hormone. But the same hormone given to mice who did not have the same brain conditions caused increased aggression. It is known that a deficiency of estrogen is linked to Alzheimer's disease. But it's also been shown that estrogen supplements may slow cognitive decline and have other positive effects on aging brains. So why, then, would a hormone that mimics estrogen increase aggressive behavior in mice that do not have an actual brain disease?|0
Did Donald Trump Release Donald Trump’s Tax Return? For a moment, it seemed that Rachel Maddow was in possession of a genuine scoop. And then, all of a sudden, it didn’t….Thanks to MSNBC, the suggestion that Trump has “paid no taxes in 18 years” has now been definitively proven to be false. Moreover, Trump seems to have paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than did most political figures, and to have enjoyed a sizeable income to boot. Whether the report was cherry-picked we cannot possibly know.|1

There’s a Speed Graphic camera, once standard equipment in newsrooms across the country. You may have seen them in 1930s and ’40s-era movies that featured gaggles of photographers, “Press” placards stuck in there fedora hatbands. Heavy, bulky and requiring light-bulb-sized flashbulbs to shoot at night, a Speed Graphic was the first camera I used professionally, for my high-school yearbook and the paper I worked for part-time while in high school and college. The one in my office used sheet film -- you’d take a shot, pull out the sheet holder, put in another.|1
Anyone who’s ever been frustrated at the task of shooting video in low light should be poised to freak out over Canon’s weird and amazing new camera. It’s a video camera that shoots full HD color footage in almost complete darkness. The ‘multi-purpose’ camera, dubbed only MH20F-SH, has a full-frame sensor with 2.26 megapixels. The reason for the meager resolution is because each pixel is very large—19 microns to be exact. That’s 7.5x larger than, say, the pixels found on a flagship DSLR like the Canon 1Dx.|1

Is our efficient Tax Office killing this country? I’ve never seen a story where the Reserve Bank was urging the Government to give tax cuts. But that’s exactly what’s happening now, which partly explains why our economy is going off the boil. In fact, the implication from this historically unusual tale is that the Tax Commissioner, Chris Jordan and his team have been doing such a great job cracking down on excessive deductions claims, especially from business. Because of the productivity delivered via computer technology, the tax take for Government is surging.|1

A communications professor at Texas A&M University wanted to find out about the effects of changes to the newspaper industry on our nation’s politics, so she did some research, which has been published in the Journal of Communication. If you have noticed what seems like a sharp increase in political polarization in the past few years, you are not imagining things. And, as Johanna Dunaway, and some colleagues at Colorado State and Louisiana State universities, found out, that polarization happened during a period of steady decrease in the number of local newspapers and journalists across the country.|1

Incline chest press machines that simulate the movement in a fixed plane are another way to perform the move.

If you want people to believe you are no longer a neo-Nazi, you have a lot of convincing to do. It takes a lot of work to shake the brown shirt.|1

JERUSALEM ( JTA ) — Israel ’ s military used unnecessary force against protesters in Lebanon who tried to breach a border fence — killing a 20-year-old demonstrator — but it was not involved in the murder of a top Hezbollah operative who was shot dead by his wife as he was sitting in a car. The Israeli military’s investigation into the two killings of the past two weeks, which took place on Thursday, found that the use of force against protesters was appropriate in the first instance, but deemed the killing of the Hezbollah operative a case of domestic violence.|0

DARTMOUTH — On June 14, Flag Day, the students of the James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth gathered outside to celebrate Flag Day.

If the U.S. presidential election were resolved on social media, Barack Obama would be the clear winner this year over Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The Obama campaign has embraced social media, with the president holding a huge lead in Facebook and Twitter followers, and the affiliated Democratic National Committee is using private social networking tools to communicate with some campaign operatives. There's also evidence that the Obama campaign has tapped into social media analytics to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of the campaign's messages. Neither campaign, contacted to discuss their social media strategies, returned messages.|1
It was a situation which baffled many around the world , let alone the passengers on board the British Airways flight that was hijacked to Cuba.

Stark County’s unemployment rate in August fell to 6.8 percent, the lowest it’s been since September 2008. For the first time since 2008, Stark County’s jobless rate slipped below 7 percent, and a variety of factors likely contributed to the decline. A leading suspect is the influx of businesses coming to the area because of oil and natural gas drilling in the Utica shale. Oil exploration companies have moved in, followed by engineering and construction firms that provide different services. Manufacturing also has seen growth because of increased demand locally and nationwide for steel and drilling equipment.|1

When the theme of the convention seems to have been, “Drill, baby, drill,” which is an energy policy in exactly the same way that, “Tax, baby, tax” is a fiscal policy (i.e., it isn’t), slogans are obviously all that the party has left.

This, by the way, was the moment when I completely gave up on the convention.|1

He looked the part in his denim and lean muscles . Many fans feel the nickname was an unfortunate byproduct of a long-standing dispute over the song 'Tie Your Mother Down' by the band's frontman, Ian Malcolm. For many, it symbolises the darker, more violent side of Ozzy. For others, it reflects the true meaning of Ozzy - a man of contradictions who has never been able to fully commit to either the good or bad in his character.

The annual meeting of the Kelly Gang is normally a festive affair. The get-together, the brainchild of New York Post media columnist Keith J. Kelly, has been held on St. Patrick’s Day for the past three years at Langan’s pub, on 47th Street. The guests: media types and others celebrating their shared surname Kelly and their innate Irishness—over corned beef and cabbage and a pint or three of Guinness.

Upon publication of the document, Woolcott informed delegates that they have 24 hours to confer with their respective governments and then report tomorrow for a final vote. For so many reasons, the United States delegation must choose the latter option.

A search for ‘toxic mold’ will result in hundreds of scary warnings and ‘studies,’ but few are based in science—and many are motivated by profit. Recently a patient of mine was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well documented, but he adamantly denied that anyone had warned him to avoid alcohol. An initial confession of “a few drinks” turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact.|1

Yet Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's decision on Thursday to close the Rafah crossing to keep PA Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh from bringing $35 million into Gaza was the first time Israel has actively intervened to stop the money flow.|1

This team is better and deeper than that, but they are not quite as good as that. That's just my opinion. Overall the Flyers had better possession numbers last season.|0
Want to end the war on whistleblowers ? Revise the Espionage Act .

Property search reveals nothing about community expertise or stellar service . Mobile is now the preferred mode of interaction with the client, but it is no substitute.

If you're going to have an app, you had better have an equally good app for desktop. If you don't, you're wasting your time.

The response to the bombs by the crowd at the finish line was, I think, exemplary. Sure, many people fled from the explosions, and reasonably so. But a remarkable number ran, as they say, to the sound of the guns, even though when two bombs go off, one might well expect more. Many of these were professionals. The finish line of a marathon is a fortuitous spot to bomb, in that doctors, policemen, ambulances and so on are stationed there. Some soldiers happened to be on hand. But others were not professionals.|1

VIDEO: On March 30, 2017, Atlanta drivers on I-85 north found themselves in a stunning situation when materials stored beneath the interstate overpass spanning Piedmont Road and Monroe Drive caught fire.

The likeliest of sources stepped up for the Boston Red Sox on Sunday. David Ortiz, never one to shy away from the big moment, jacked a three-run homer off Joba Chamberlain in the ninth inning to give the Red Sox a 5-3 win over the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. The victory snapped Boston’s five-game losing streak and stopped the club’s streak of seven consecutive series ending in sweeps. Ortiz’s heroics obviously put the Red Sox over the top.

The Korea Offshore and Shipbuilding Association has released numbers confirming the expectations of many analysts : the number of actively registered offshore vessel design and construction companies has more than doubled in the last year.

Firstly, many of the new projects, particularly those being designed by international and domestic shipyards, are being developed in a way that does not always reflect the capabilities of the domestic shipbuilding industry, or of the shipyards’ skills sets.|0
Everyone knows where and what they were doing when this nightmare called 9/11 happened. Chuck was getting ready for work and I was on the computer watching FOX when those horrible images appeared.

For some reason, even before I knew why and what, tears had sprung from my eyes. It's funny how your gut instincts take over before your mind even registers what's happening.|1

Study suggests complex behaviors were handed down for tens of thousands of years . Despite intense scientific inquiry , there's still a lot to learn about how the human brain works. Scientists have learned the brain is divided into various regions , including a large collection of areas that regulate emotions , thoughts and actions.

"Twitter used to be a cool place to share your succinct thoughts. Now al-Shabab, the vicious Somali allies of al-Qaida, is using it as a propaganda venue. al-Shabab began tweeting in English on Wednesday using the handle @HSMPress. (HSM is the English acronym of al-Shabab's more grandiose name, the Harakat al-Shabab al-Mujahideen.) Jack Dorsey and company have yet to verify the account, but it sounds fairly authentic: one Wednesday tweet said the terrorists ""welcomed"" the surrender of seven Somali government soldiers after they ""proclaim[ed] repentance from apostasy."""|1

An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco today to block a California law that would require presidential candidates to list every campaign contribution, no matter how small, on tax returns for the previous decade. The law passed the legislature with little fanfare last month. The law requires candidates for president, Congress and statewide office to list every “electioneering communication” that exceeded $1,000 in the prior year and is made in coordination with a federal campaign committee. The law also requires state-paid consultants who worked on campaigns in coordination with federal committees to report all such contributions.|0

When George Orwell wrote â€œ1984â€ he included a vision of the future in which people would converse in a language called. Orwell described Newspeak as “the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year”. Orwellâ€™s idea with Newspeak was to have a world where all shades of meaning were removed from language, which reinforced the total dominance of the State. Calling something one thing when itâ€™s the exact opposite also might be an example of Orwellian Newspeak, like calling a bill full of spending on liberal social programs an economic stimulus plan.|1

The overstuffed roster for X-Men : Days of Future Past just got a little bit smaller .

to go on for years ? According to analyses by Net experts , the mass-mailing MyDoom worm , which began circulating in January , will still infect computers and servers around the world for months to come.

With Pittsburgh winning at New Jersey, the Flyers fell back to eight points out of a playoff spot again.|1
The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre. It is bizarre because it flies in the face of the most fundamental of American political values, particularly the core American belief that a President must have a clear mandate from the electorate before he or she starts acting as their agent and enforcers. If the President is not legally allowed to act without their say-so, how can the President act with impunity? No matter what, he has no legitimacy. And yet that is not what the Intelligence agencies want.|0
Part two of Naomi Klein's report on the events that triggered a momentous new kind of politics in Argentina. Up until quite recently, Argentina pursued a policy of official amnesia when it came to the crimes of the Dirty War. Sure, the human rights non-governmental organisations still issued numerous scathing reports, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo still marched and the children of disappeared parents still showed up, from time to time, outside the homes of ex-military figures to throw red paint. But before the Argentinazo, most middle-class Argentinians regarded such actions as macabre rituals from a bygone era.|1

OTTAWA , March 20 ( Reuters ) - In a fresh blow to the embattled government of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, two former Canadian Cabinet ministers said on Friday they do not believe a deal struck between the prime minister and opposition leader Jack Layton can be delivered in time to form a new government before Parliament's scheduled May 2 election.

Study suggests complex behaviors were handed down for tens of thousands of years. Despite intense scientific inquiry, there are still major gaps in our knowledge about early human life.

Forget announcing your latest album with a gigantic, budget-crippling open-air concert - Oasis have been hiring street musicians to do the heavy promo work for them. A gaggle of buskers and street performers were collected on Friday to perform new Oasis songs at various sites around Manhattan. The ragtag group included violinists, guitarists, and – we can only hope – some of those human statues covered in gold spray paint. From subway platforms to park clearings, they played across the five boroughs – even in the pouring rain. Thoth and Dominic Del Principe were some of those who got rained on.|1

She discovered this only when one doctor later referenced the notes. Julie, a 43-year-old lawyer, was unnerved, then angry. “The details are really nobody’s business,” she said. But Partners disagrees.|1
To involve private sector in healthcare, what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to reach out to more people. The nation has a new health policy after 14 years. The long gap itself indicates the priority, or the lack thereof, accorded to a sector that is in need of some urgent attention and has deep linkages with the nation’s aspiration to grow faster and emerge as a strong economy in the global order. The new policy has proposed seven key shifts in organising healthcare services, among them a welcome change in primary care from selective to assured comprehensive care with linkages to referral hospitals.|1

I have just been reminded of why I quit financial journalism after 11 years in the saddle, including a spell as a Wall Street correspondent. While the world of finance had its fascinations, I grew increasingly disillusioned by the dominant narrative that it was always about the money, rather than any other considerations such as values and social impacts. They never registered on the radar. That's not altogether surprising, given the testosterone-fuelled dealing rooms and the fact there is very little connection between the decisions of City executives and their impact on ordinary peoples' lives.|1

Syria: Why is Assad Advancing? In the Presidential elections held at the beginning of June, Assad was declared the winner with 88.7% of the vote.

Why is this? Stop criminal attack on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli army embarked on a ground offensive into Gaza.|1

But the erstwhile Marshall Mathers was in the running for years to play the lead role in Antoine Fuqua's boxing drama Southpaw, which, like so many other projects, wound up languishing in development. Now the project has been picked up by the Weinstein Company, and though Eminem isn't technically out of the running, he may be on the verge of being replaced by some of the biggest starts out there.|1

The traditionally conservative Michelin guide , celebrating its 100th year and a new , leaner look for its mascot , has decided the best way to celebrate the milestone would be to stop printing its Michelin guide entirely. The French guide, a staple for many drivers, restaurant goers and foodies, this year celebrates its 100th anniversary since the Michelin Guide became a guide to Paris in 1913. However the guide has now said it will only be publishing the annual guide in print form - and for the first time not online.

As a veteran of the movement to combat climate change, I have been conditioned to expect disappointment. So when, as administration coordinator for Fossil Free Stanford, I was called into the office of the senior assistant to the Stanford University president in early May, I approached the meeting with apprehension. There were good reasons for my concern. That very morning, Harvard had arrested a student demanding an open dialogue on fossil fuel divestment. Last fall, Brown University flatly refused student calls to sever ties with thirteen of the dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policies at a national and international level had fared no better.|1

First , we looked at which major brands cost the most to maintain over the first 10 years of a typical owner's car, and we've done the same for every year since 2001. Now we're taking a look at each brand's total lifetime ownership costs, by adding up the per-year price for each year, then totalling it all up for a full lifespan. It's an imperfect analysis, but a good one, since it accounts for both the upfront price and the depreciation value of a car. So how does the total lifetime ownership cost stack up for different brands?|0

The carrier operates 744 mainline planes that vary in size, carrying 50 to 366 passengers each. For a typical 737 plane carrying 179 passengers, the reduction would mean about 11 pounds per flight. Per the paper, stopping on-board sales of duty-free items like “perfumes, chocolates and liquor” also saved 1.4 millions of gallons of fuel annually, saving United Airlines $2.3 million. Presumably that also means United was making less than $2.3 million selling the items in-flight or calculated that allowing passengers to pick them up at ground level would not dent its revenue significantly.|1

Manufacturing is especially attractive to Japanese and Korean firms. Retail is booming, given the rise in domestic consumption.|1
To involve private sector in healthcare , what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to create more and more public clinics, hospitals etc., that are owned by government and managed and run for the benefit of the general public.

The last few years have seen quite a bit of private sector involvement in healthcare in many countries. Have they been a disaster? As for the private sector not providing healthcare, I think it's pretty much a given that they do.|0

At the same time, however, it does this on the authority of the elected Political Executive that is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy.|1

With the economy beginning to stall, Ben Bernanke's war on the nation's savers rolls on. A few of these funds even pay juicy double-digit yields — like the one my Permanent Wealth Investor subscribers have earned 20% on in two years. Dividend harvest funds: These funds buy shares in companies that are about to pay a dividend, and then sell the stock after the dividend is paid. By doing this, they can rotate through companies with different payment dates, and thereby achieve a high dividend payout. The problem is that shares generally trade lower after a dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend.|1

It was a Saturday morning. August. I remember it vividly. I was online, sat up in bed, browsing, not looking for anything in particular. An article caught my eye: it was about the refugee crisis. Men, women and children were risking their lives to get to western Europe, and many were dying in the process. It was a story of endurance and terrible trauma. In response I expected compassion, a swell of fellow feeling. But my heart sank as I read the comments. There was so much cruelty.|1
Central American referee Carlos Batres has fallen for the worst dive of the World Cup by the most theatrical Italian since Federico Fellini. By doing so, he cost New Zealand's All Whites a famous win over football's reigning world champions. The scenes were reminiscent of Australia's defeat to Italy in the 2006 World Cup. Then, the 10-man Italian team scored an injury-time penalty after Fabio Grosso tumbled over defender Lucas Neill. Fabio Grosso goes down after a challenge by Lucas Neill during the 2006 World Cup.

The Internet has changed beyond anything could have foreseen just five years ago. It is no longer a browsing medium: it is full of Web 2.0 applications, real time communications challenges and a whole range of threats that are designed to piggy back on this new usage. As a result, Web security has changed immeasurably - it's no longer enough to block, stop or inhibit IP sessions. Web filtering cannot hope to meet the security challenge. This Webinar will explain how Internet usage has changed and how your perception of IT may not match what your users are actually doing, resulting in your security controls being by-passed.|1

My daughter, a resident advisor at her college, recently groaned while mentioning that she’d likely get additional foreign exchange students to supervise this fall. When I asked why that’s a bad thing, she said the foreign exchange kids tend to presume Americans are stupid unless proven otherwise.

Oh, she replied, they don’t think our colleges are stupid.|1

A local state representative is calling for fundamental reform of the state’s standardized testing system after the “litany of errors” he claims plagued the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2016.

We know in our minds that we have a certain range of abilities , a certain way of perceiving and understanding the world which we call the life of the mind , and we know that others do not have the same abilities or the same perceptions and understanding.|0

This past June, the Tacoma Rainiers brought reindeer mascot Rhubarb and local icon “Epic Sax Gorilla” up onto the roof of Cheney Stadium, where the Triple-A club plays, for a routine crowd-pleasing stunt. Also up on the roof was Tacoma News Tribune columnist Matt Driscoll, who recently explained how roof dancing earned both his employer and the ball club thousands of dollars in fines from Washington’s Department of Labor and Industries. But buried somewhere in the pile of public documents I eventually obtained, a single email — from a single individual — helped provide a fuller answer.|1

Can you put a price on faith? That is the question churchgoers are asking as the tradition of tithing -- giving 10% of your income to the church -- is increasingly challenged. Opponents of tithing say it is a misreading of the Bible, a practice created by man, not God. They say they should be free to donate whatever amount they choose, and they are arguing with pastors, writing letters and quitting congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teaching and rejected what has been a favored form of fund raising for decades.|1

The first time I heard these verses was in a small storefront church in Kiev , Ukraine . I remember the church , and the pastor who led the meeting, because the congregation was made up of a handful of students who were there to learn about the Bible .

In my church , in fact , most of the members who are in their late 20s and 30s were raised without a Christian foundation.|0

Multiple bills at the New Jersey statehouse are of interest to truckers and others using roadways throughout the state. Repeat drunk driving offenders could soon face harsher penalties for their actions. New Jersey law now limits punishment for affected offenders to a traffic offense. Bail typically is set at $2,500. The traffic offense designation allows drivers charged with drunken driving to continue to drive while awaiting their court date. Awaiting consideration on the Assembly floor is a bill to end that practice. Instead, A3057 would boost punishment for a person convicted of driving under the influence two times or more within 60 days to a fourth-degree crime.|1

The Bible teaches, “Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are led by various lusts (see 1 Tim.3:5-6). Many great people in God have fallen into fleshly temptations and potentially ruined their lives and ministries. One person has said, “It takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it.” This is a true saying! I believe one of the most important reasons leaders fall is that most have never intentionally set up mental and emotional firewalls.|1

Then there is all the Islamic terrorist violence. While most Libyans appreciate the help from Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Kaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become more of a menace than the Kaddafi era secret police ever were.|1
