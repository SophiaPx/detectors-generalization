"The sad demise of late veteran actor Kader Khan has left a void in the Hindi film industry that can barely be filled by a talented, talented actor.

The centerpiece of the rebuild is the warehouse, which was constructed in 1943, according to the date scrawled in concrete. It is made of wood. The roof leaks. There is no air conditioning, let alone a cold-storage unit for fresh fruits and vegetables. The warehouse should have been leveled years ago. But those at Poverello House trudged on, as they always have, doing a lot with very little. When it rains, it pours inside. The extreme temperatures spoil our food. And it presents serious pest-control problems.|1

"As a veteran of the movement to combat climate change, I have been conditioned to expect disappointment. So why does this surprise me? It doesn't appear that there has been a massive shift in policy, but more than a lot of people are moving away from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (CO₃) as well. And it's interesting to see how little we know about it. In his first public comment since taking office on Friday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that the country will come to ""full-speed ahead"" on climate change, even as he promised an increase in U.S.-China investment."|0

Saturday night's game was exactly like Friday night's game for the Amarillo Bulls in terms of score and results, and if they have one more game like it, they'll have no more games.

I have just been reminded of why I quit financial journalism after 11 years in the saddle, including a spell as a Wall Street correspondent. While the world of finance had its fascinations, I grew increasingly disillusioned by the dominant narrative that it was always about the money, rather than any other considerations such as values and social impacts. They never registered on the radar. That's not altogether surprising, given the testosterone-fuelled dealing rooms and the fact there is very little connection between the decisions of City executives and their impact on ordinary peoples' lives.|1

Moreover, Trump seems to have paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than did most political figures, and to have enjoyed a sizeable income to boot. Whether the report was cherry-picked we cannot possibly know.|1

DALLAS - Like many Americans, Martin Jacobson was overjoyed that Navy SEALs had captured and killed Osama bin Laden, but he also wondered what he'd expected. For those who still believe in Islam, it is difficult to believe that any American citizen has ever actually taken up arms against the Islamic State. Yet on Sept. 10, at least 14 people died and 53 others were injured when a bomb exploded outside ISIS headquarters in Fallujah, Iraq. The incident comes two weeks after another suicide bomber blew himself up at a market in Mosul, injuring at least 30 people.|0
Shall we pause for just a moment to define impact investing? Great! Now that they ’ re gone on the record, many investors must decide what impact they have on an investment. But if it is one of those investments, the impact of a change in portfolio composition could potentially be much larger than their original forecast. Investing decisions about stock market performance may become less influential as the markets recover and the economy improves. A better understanding of market movements would also help investors choose options to make investments in stocks, which will ultimately determine whether or not to make a capital decision.|0

WASHINGTON — South Florida has long been a laboratory for some of the nation’s roughest politics, with techniques like phantom candidates created by political rivals to siphon off votes from their opponents, or so-called boleteras hired to illegally fill out stacks of absentee ballots on behalf of elderly or disabled voters.

First, we looked at which major brands cost the most to maintain over the first 10 years of a car's life. We grouped all years of all models by brand to compute their average cost by brand. In order to estimate annual maintenance costs, we found the amount spent on every two oil changes (as oil changes are generally done every six months). German imports lead the list by a fair margin, which isn't too surprising. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners on at least $10,000 over ten years compared to a BMW.|1

Why is this? Stop criminal attack on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli army embarked on a ground offensive into Gaza.|1

Study suggests complex behaviors were handed down for tens of thousands of years. Despite intense scientific inquiry, there are still major gaps in our knowledge about early human life. One major question that remains unanswered: when humans were first capable of complex cognition? In other words, when did early humans develop sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as prioritization and cultural transmission, that we would recognize today? A new study in Nature addresses this; after six years of excavation, archaeologists have unearthed technologically-advanced stone tools that were created about 71,000 years ago.|1

In February this year, news broke that Rupert Murdoch — a self-proclaimed ""free marketeer"" — had paid £90 million to save the Daily Mirror from bankruptcy. The arrangement would have meant no more than £60 per share, or less than 12 per cent of the total amount spent on making the newspaper profitable."|0

RICH KARLGAARD : You should look at 4 areas. One is financial regulations, which still makes it hard for you to meet the minimum standard of living for your family members and friends. It's very easy to lose confidence in your ability to get ahead. The second is a growing number of private-sector workers who want to do more than simply work full time or earn less, but instead invest their savings in research, innovation and skills. So we need to be careful not to let those that are coming after us get into trouble.|0

"The main task of North Korea's junior minister for re-information is to refute everything ever said by French intellectuals. One year he did a special on Jean-Paul Sartre and began with Sartre's assertion that ""Three o'clock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do"". As it was a drowsy Friday afternoon, the junior minister simply made a quick call and renamed his local football team 4.25 Sports Club. This made Sartre look very silly indeed, because the club play all their matches at 4.25pm. In fact every time they play, their fans chant ""Are you watching, Jean-Paul Sartre?"""|1

DARTMOUTH — On June 14, Flag Day, the students of the James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth gathered outside to celebrate Flag Day.

Earlier in the year around Veteran's Day, Dr. Karafotis asked her students to send cards to Staff Sergeant Cote in order to cheer him up.

Millennials are not a homogenous group of individuals, so a one-size-fits-all marcomms approach won't work. Millennials want healthy food and are willing to spend more on it.

The life of the mind puzzles poets and neuroscientists who go about mapping it and labeling it, and, and why we have so many other ways to express it, even if we are only human beings.

Drones come in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes these days, but generally speaking, most of them still fall within one of two categories. There are those of the multi-rotor variety (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc), and those of the winged variety. Both categories have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor aircraft are typically more stable and easy to fly, but also much slower than wing drones that focus on forward acceleration. Conversely, winged drones can fly faster and further than their hovering counterparts, but are harder to pilot, since they can’t perform vertical takeoffs and landings.|1

"Less than two years ago, I was seated at a South Atlantic League baseball game ( low A ball ) with my family. At first glance, the picture seemed odd. It took on all sorts of life-threatening proportions, but what really stood out was my wife, who had never seen it in person. When she tried to go home, she said, ""I don't know where you live."" She'd been there three or four days. I asked why. She replied, ""Why aren't you looking?"" The answer was simple."|0
It's hard to underestimate the success and increasing power of Amazon. Their market cap hovers just under $200 billion, which makes them one of the largest privately-held companies operating in the online video industry, according to a report released earlier this year by the U.S. Department of Labor. That is not enough for Amazon to make a big dent in the digital video market, where they're currently trading at more than $8 billion dollars per unit, or $5.25 billion for every dollar they raise in the last few years.|0

The world has seen an unprecedented number of outbreaks of measles, the virus that affects more than 1 billion people worldwide every year. As of January 20, 2018, there had been over 100 cases of measles globally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health System (NHS).

Millennials are not a homogenous group of individuals, so a one-size-fits-all marcomms approach won't work. Millennials want to be part of the country, yet they do not have much in common. They are different from our generation in some ways — they identify as Democrats, unaffiliated with Republicans and generally lean toward the left — but they also share a strong commitment to freedom for their children and grandchildren. In recent years, the National Coalition for Family and Religious Freedom said it hoped to build on that momentum with a policy that would include religious freedom protections for gays and lesbians.|0

A search for ‘toxic mold’ will result in hundreds of scary warnings and ‘studies,’ but few are based in science—and many are motivated by profit. Recently a patient of mine was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well documented, but he adamantly denied that anyone had warned him to avoid alcohol. An initial confession of “a few drinks” turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact.|1

Northern Ireland was today branded the race hate capital of Europe, in a report on racist violence in the U.K. The United Kingdom's top court ruled last December that the Police and Crime Commissioner will continue to face criminal charges if their actions lead to arrests in connection with the Manchester atrocity, which left 14 dead.

According to data provided in the World Economic Forumâ€™s Global Enabling Trade Report 2012, the countryâ€™s macroeconomic fundamentals are strong, making it attractive to at least a fraction of the foreign investors concerned over the Euro crisis. The countryâ€™s biggest investment opportunities are in manufacturing, real estate, agriculture, mining, infrastructure, retail, and tourism â€“ areas of investment that are largely untapped given the quantity of FDI seeking attractive international opportunities. Manufacturing is especially attractive to Japanese and Korean firms. Retail is booming, given the rise in domestic consumption.|1
The life of the mind puzzles poets and neuroscientists who go about mapping it and labeling it, and, in my case, trying to find it. Thought itself is something to ponder in the Irish tradition and so, there are lots of concepts in the Irish language involving the mind, dreaming, and imagination. I'm only a student myself, so many of the nuances will be lost on me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear native speakers offer more sophisticated thoughts on the vocabulary of Irish thought.|1

Gaza is the world’s biggest prison. Nearly two million Palestinian people are locked up there by Israel’s military blockade. Last year, racist Israel killed over 2,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 547 children. The Pentagon rushed in more bombs when the Zionist state ran low on ­ammunition. Baltimore, similar to Palestine, is under a racist military occupation. The Baltimore police force — the sixth largest in the 26th largest U.S. city — treats Black people like prisoners.

We got into this area, and the homes are stunning, and it just seemed nicer. The people who sold us this house live next door, Rodney and Desmond. They already had a couple of offers. I think partly what happened is that they wanted us as neighbors: a pregnant couple trying to get a first-time home buy. I’m sure probably that was more appealing than .1 percent more on the down payment or whatever."|1

A CANCER expert has hit on a way to kill tumours in two hours — using light. The technique involves removing the tumour from tissue and placing it at a distance of 1m (15ft) off the ground for 20 minutes, before moving it away. However, it may be more accurate than that, due to the low amount of energy required to process a tumour through your body. It doesn't matter how bad you are or how good your job is, if you just want to live, you've probably got to go.|0

Not only did former BP chief executive Tony Hayward go sailing on his yacht at the height of the oil-spill, but he was also caught up in the drama that is the current Gulf of Mexico. And it was Hayward, who has since called for a federal investigation into ExxonMobil's role in the scandal, which exposed widespread corruption by senior executives at BP, the world's top oil producer. This month I received my copy of the State Department's report on foreign aid to Syria. It includes an extensive analysis of the impact of sanctions, and its conclusions are based on what I've read so far.|0

Montana, Exxon-Mobil At Odds Over Oil Spill Montana and oil giant Exxon-Mobil are at odds over an oil spill in the state's Yellowstone River. Exxon-Mobil says it's doing all it can to clean up the spill and has promised to see the cleanup through. That's not enough for Montana's state officials — particularly its governor. They say that the company hasn't been forthright on the extent of the spill and that they're not doing enough. Michele Norris speaks with Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer about those accusations — and the steps the state is taking to rectify them.|1

At her weekly therapy sessions, Julie revealed her most uncomfortable secrets: depression, debt, childhood sexual abuse. Her psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital would then type a summary into Julie’s computerized medical record. With that, more than 200 pages of sensitive notes became available to any doctor who cared for her within the sprawling Partners HealthCare system. She discovered this only when one doctor later referenced the notes. Julie, a 43-year-old lawyer, was unnerved, then angry. “The details are really nobody’s business,” she said. But Partners disagrees.|1

This month, Drake finished his residency at the O2 Arena in London. But he wasn’t quite ready to fly back over the pond and go home. Instead, over the weekend, he joined Tiffany Calver, who hosts the BBC 1Xtra Rap Show and became her co-host for the day. While there, he spoke about a myriad of things. He talked about the early days of his career and he even addressed the rumours about him being a culture vulture because he appropriates British and Caribbean cultures.

PREBLE COUNTY — With two serious crashes involving young people occurring in Preble County over the past week, Preble County Sheriff Mike Simpson discussed summer driving practices as younger, less experienced drivers become more active during the summer. According to Simpson, during the summer roadways often become more active and younger drivers tend to be on the road more because they are no longer in school. “With kids out of school or kids back from college, there a lot more of younger drivers on the roadways going back and forth from events or work now that they aren’t in schools for 6-7 hours a day,” Simpson said.|1

Without much fuss or fanfare, but, happily, with plenty of shoppers, Salisbury quietly reopened its central business district on the East End for a short visit last year. This has seen the shop expand rapidly and offer a wide range of local, national and international orders.

"An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco today to block a California law that could have allowed parents to turn away their children if they were arrested and later charged with committing an offense related to a minor.

In Lean Times, Creative Bakers Turn To Desperation Pies : The Salt Vinegar pie and green tomato pie don't usually top the list of America's favorite sweets.

It is easy to lose democratic mechanisms but difficult to get them back, says the incoming General Secretary of State for Defence, Brigadier-General Sadiq.

DELRAY BEACH — Overdoses are on the decline in Delray Beach, continuing a trend that started last year. The latest data collected by the Delray Beach Police Department shows there were fewer citywide drug overdoses in March than that time frame last year and in 2016, when there was a record-breaking number of reported overdoses. As the country grapples with the widespread opioid epidemic, Delray Beach, often regarded as the rehab capital of the nation, is seeing fewer sober homes and fewer overdoses, data shows. There were 21 overdoses in March, roughly a third of the 59 reported overdoses in March 2017.|1

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but also for that reason, an extraordinary case study for evaluating the mandate that should determine the relationship between the National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation. Ideally speaking, the national security set up anchored on Intelligence, exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security –external or internal –with the aim of neutralising it in time. At the same time, however, it does this on the authority of the elected Political Executive that is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy.|1

Can you put a price on faith? That is the question churchgoers are asking as the tradition of tithing -- giving 10% of your income to the church -- is increasingly challenged. Opponents of tithing say it is a misreading of the Bible, a practice created by man, not God. They say they should be free to donate whatever amount they choose, and they are arguing with pastors, writing letters and quitting congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teaching and rejected what has been a favored form of fund raising for decades.|1

The Bible teaches, “Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are led by various lusts (see 1 Tim.3:5-6). Many great people in God have fallen into fleshly temptations and potentially ruined their lives and ministries. One person has said, “It takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it.” This is a true saying! I believe one of the most important reasons leaders fall is that most have never intentionally set up mental and emotional firewalls.|1

LONDON -- An IT worker threw out a computer hard drive without realizing it contained $ 7.5 million worth of classified material, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said Tuesday. In a new twist in the Russia scandal involving President Vladimir Putin and his Russian business partner, a New York court ruled that the Justice Department must hand over all information to the federal authorities as soon as possible. On Monday, former FBI Director James Comey testified before Congress that he believes the U.S. government should not know anything about what he found on a laptop containing classified information.|0

Part two of Naomi Klein's report on the events that triggered a momentous new kind of politics in Argentina. Up until quite recently, Argentina pursued a policy of official amnesia when it came to the crimes of the Dirty War. Sure, the human rights non-governmental organisations still issued numerous scathing reports, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo still marched and the children of disappeared parents still showed up, from time to time, outside the homes of ex-military figures to throw red paint. But before the Argentinazo, most middle-class Argentinians regarded such actions as macabre rituals from a bygone era.|1
Forget announcing your latest album with a gigantic, budget-crippling open-air concert - Oasis have been hiring street musicians to perform their music on stage at The Royal Albert Hall in Edinburgh. In the early hours of Friday morning, April 25, 1892, a small group of women and children were travelling down an old highway just across the Scottish countryside. They began a short drive from a home which had recently been converted into a house for sale. Soon they heard a rumbling noise coming from the road. They quickly realized something was amiss. There was not much blood on the road.|0
My daughter, a resident advisor at her college, recently groaned while mentioning that she’d likely get additional foreign exchange students to supervise this fall. When I asked why that’s a bad thing, she said the foreign exchange kids tend to presume Americans are stupid unless proven otherwise. They assume Americans aren’t as well-traveled, or as fluent in foreign languages or as knowledgeable about world cultures. I said what any Good American would: Why don’t they stay home, then? Oh, she replied, they don’t think our colleges are stupid.|1
It was a situation which baffled many around the world, let alone the passengers on board the British Airways flight, who were given a brief tour of the cabin after their flight departed. Tens of thousands of residents in New York are outraged over plans for a controversial new art project that aims to remove the statue of Jesus Christ outside of the iconic New York City Museum. In a letter filed with state attorneys general Monday, lawyers for the city say it could result in the demolition of about 700 of the two- and four-story statues, including one depicting Jesus Christ's face from the frescoes of Jerusalem before his crucifixion.|0

It was another quarter of rapid growth for the optical-equipment maker, but shares fell as investors were uninspired by the revenue forecast. Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN) reported its first-quarter results on April 27 after the market closed.

At 3:40 p.m., shares were down nearly 24% from the previous close. Let's dig into the results to see how the company performed in the three areas that I suggested investors should pay attention to.|1
South Bend (IN) -- Thursday morning, the Irish took the practice field for the final time before Saturday's Blue-Gold game. One of the biggest questions the team faced entering spring ball still has yet to be answered: who will step up at linebacker? Defensive coordinator Clark Lea said fifth-year linebacker Asmar Bilal is the closest thing the unit has to an 'absolute' at this point, but he seems ok with the uncertainty.

Everyone knows where and what they were doing when this nightmare called 9/11 happened. Chuck was getting ready for work and I was on the computer watching FOX when those horrible images appeared. I had the TV on mute so all I saw were flames coming out of one of the Towers in NY. I turned on the sound and the words were incomprehensible. For some reason, even before I knew why and what, tears had sprung from my eyes. It's funny how your gut instincts take over before your mind even registers what's happening.|1

Tech execs discuss the impact automation technologies are having on their organisations. For many organisations and their workers, technology automation is an opportunity and a threat. On one hand, using robotic process automation and other tools creates efficiencies by automating manual and repetitive tasks. On the other, it has the potential to make jobs redundant. Tech execs gathered at roundtable events in Sydney and Melbourne recently to discuss the impact automation technologies are having on their organisations. A key issue raised during the discussion was the challenge of ensuring governance policies and procedures are followed as ‘bots’ replace tasks carried out by humans across the business.|1

The Internet has changed beyond anything could have foreseen just five years ago. It is no longer a browsing medium: it is full of Web 2.0 applications, real time communications challenges and a whole range of threats that are designed to piggy back on this new usage. As a result, Web security has changed immeasurably - it's no longer enough to block, stop or inhibit IP sessions. Web filtering cannot hope to meet the security challenge. This Webinar will explain how Internet usage has changed and how your perception of IT may not match what your users are actually doing, resulting in your security controls being by-passed.|1

WASHINGTON - RFK Stadium, the once and future home of major league baseball in the nation's capital, doesn't yet look like a field of dreams. It's configured for soccer, not baseball. The field must be replaced, and the dugouts, locker rooms and press box need upgrades. On a rainy day last week, a quarter of the field was mud and tire tracks. It looked like Vince Lombardi should be coaching football here - which he once did for the Washington Redskins. But that was in 1969.|1

LATROBE - Ainsley Battles is back in a Pittsburgh Steelers uniform. Battles, a safety, was brought in as a defensive end this offseason with the 5-12 team, but didn't show up in Week 1.

Even worse, the biggest shipyards in the world – DSME, Hyundai Heavy and Samsung Heavy – may well have empty space and unused capacity sometime next year.|1

Brazil is currently implementing the Brasil Sem Miséria programme — a continuation of the successful Fome Zero— which aims to do just that, Marques Porto says. Initiated in 2003 by former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Fome Zero is credited with having taken 30 to 40 million Brazilians out of poverty. One of the core actions of the programme was providing poor children with free school lunches, which were purchased by the state from family farms. In this way, support to local small farmers was provided at the same time as offering quality nutrition to children from low-income families.|1

Stark County’s unemployment rate in August fell to 6.8 percent, the lowest it’s been since September 2008.

Oil exploration companies have moved in, followed by engineering and construction firms that provide different services. Manufacturing also has seen growth because of increased demand locally and nationwide for steel and drilling equipment.|1

The Korea Offshore and Shipbuilding Association has released numbers confirming the expectations of many analysts : the number of actively engaged construction workers is on a par with the national average of about 2,600 employed per year.

Maenga is disappointed over your press release against the statement of apology from UTM president Saulos Chilima. If you think Malawi is living the past where your police lied to the country that Robert Chasowa committed suicide when in true sense your party killed him, you are mistakenly wrong. Malawi of today is not ready to tolerate nonsense. Few weeks ago when your party terrorized the nation your president Peter Mutharika failed to utter any word. Upon growing pressure the president instructed Mgeme Kalirani to craft a statement that did not address what the nation expected.

A communications professor at Texas A&M University wanted to find out about the effects of changes to the newspaper industry on our nation’s politics, so she did some research, which has been published in the Journal of Communication. If you have noticed what seems like a sharp increase in political polarization in the past few years, you are not imagining things. And, as Johanna Dunaway, and some colleagues at Colorado State and Louisiana State universities, found out, that polarization happened during a period of steady decrease in the number of local newspapers and journalists across the country.|1

"Could drain tubes solve Compact conflict? How do we get more water into the Republican River? Could it save us from catastrophic flooding in Florida, a state that is expected to see more than 40 inches of rain this season? Is it possible to create a ""new world,"" a new economy or a new culture? The most intriguing question at this stage is what kind of change can be made.

Multiple bills at the New Jersey statehouse are of interest to truckers and others using roadways throughout the state. Repeat drunk driving offenders could soon face harsher penalties for their actions. New Jersey law now limits punishment for affected offenders to a traffic offense. Bail typically is set at $2,500. The traffic offense designation allows drivers charged with drunken driving to continue to drive while awaiting their court date. Awaiting consideration on the Assembly floor is a bill to end that practice. Instead, A3057 would boost punishment for a person convicted of driving under the influence two times or more within 60 days to a fourth-degree crime.|1

Not everyone grew to love it. In these days, “clearing” sent hordes of last-minute placements to what they fondly anticipated as the cloistered life of Queen’s College, St Andrews.|1
"Don Draper : Who's crying now? When Jon Hamm last hosted “ Saturday Night Live ” in January of 1990, the actor said that he wanted to cry for the family.

A collection of powerful short films where children explain, in their own words, what it is like to be an adolescent. The film, which focuses on the struggles of a group of young women living in rural New Hampshire, has inspired generations of families to explore life's most important challenges and offer them new ways to express themselves. For many, including myself, this was a great way to celebrate our time together during the Great Recession. We were together when we had our first child—a girl from a very different family.|0

In the lead up to the Super Bowl last week, NFL Hall of Famer Ladainian Tomlinson gave his projection of how it will affect the Denver Broncos starting quarterback. Tomlinson said he has a strong opinion that Denver should take a step back in Week 13, before they go into the postseason for the first time ever. Tomlinson added that he doesn't think Peyton Manning's injury woes are related to the absence of Tim Tebow from camp.

The Maltings, which connects the coach park to the city centre, has been off-limits to the public and shielded by safety cordons and tents since the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on one of its park benches after being poisoned.

Want to end the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the act has metastasized into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has done much to shape the freedom of political debate in the modern U.S. What began as a vague statute that gave President Woodrow Wilson power to jail critics and censor the news media during World War I has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by policing secrets, not speech. Censorship did not end when the war did. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute.|1

A CANCER expert has hit on a way to kill tumours in two hours — using light. The technique involves a single jab with a chemical then a flash of ultraviolet. Cancer cells in lab mice were found to self-destruct, with up to 95 per cent dead in two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed the cells — which he injected with the chemical compound nitrobenzaldehyde — turned too acidic to survive. He said after patenting his “photodynamic” therapy: “There are many different types of cancers. “The one thing they have in common is their susceptibility to this induced cell suicide.|1
"Trisha Pollard believes the Texas social services system relies too much on the courts to police Medicaid fraud and not enough on a tool placed in its hands nearly nine years ago: criminal background checks. ""It just seems like something so simple,"" Pollard said Tuesday. ""People in other walks of life are routinely put through background checks."" The 52-year-old retired attorney stumbled across the issue last fall when she served as a Harris County grand jury forewoman. During her term, Pollard and fellow grand jurors returned indictments against two Medicaid providers, each of whom had a criminal past that included involvement in Medicaid fraud."|1
NASA will plunge a small robot into a volcano in Hawaii in order to map data and geographical features of its insides, such as fissures and volcanic vents. A similar robot is already exploring the volcano. “We don't know exactly how volcanoes erupt. We have models but they are all very, very simplified. This project aims to help make those models more realistic,” Carolyn Parcheta, a postdoctoral fellow based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said, according to NASA. The robot, developed by NASA, can climb into areas that are inaccessible to humans.|1

The response to the bombs by the crowd at the finish line was, I think, exemplary. Sure, many people fled from the explosions, and reasonably so. But a remarkable number ran, as they say, to the sound of the guns, even though when two bombs go off, one might well expect more. Many of these were professionals. The finish line of a marathon is a fortuitous spot to bomb, in that doctors, policemen, ambulances and so on are stationed there. Some soldiers happened to be on hand. But others were not professionals.|1
Israeli PM says he will deliver major policy speech for achieving peace with Palestinians. The prime minister has so far been unable to deliver on all his promises and is reportedly expected to spend the night at a hotel in Ramallah ahead of the start of the US-Israel military drill next week.

The Washington Post (WSJ, 6:35 p.m.), citing anonymous sources, reported Friday that Donald Trump may soon become the 45th president of the United States after taking office in January.|0
To involve private sector in healthcare, what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to reach out to more people. The nation has a new health policy after 14 years. The long gap itself indicates the priority, or the lack thereof, accorded to a sector that is in need of some urgent attention and has deep linkages with the nation’s aspiration to grow faster and emerge as a strong economy in the global order. The new policy has proposed seven key shifts in organising healthcare services, among them a welcome change in primary care from selective to assured comprehensive care with linkages to referral hospitals.|1
Girls Like Biology, Boys Like Physics? We all have our stereotypes about which subjects appeal more to girls. But how do boys like math or physics? How can we create a world without having to deal with it? This paper presents the best solutions to some of these questions. The paper describes two possible strategies, but they work together in three different ways. First, boys are taught to look at concepts and models as well as mathematical concepts. This is accomplished by using mathematics as the starting point; second, boys take an interest in what the data reveals about their own individual brain activity during tasks.|0
[Written by Jonathan Starling] It is not unusual to read and hear complaints about the amount of trash talk that the two main parties indulge, a phenomenon which seems to be magnified during election campaigns. And yet, seldom do these two parties actively seek to engage in real trash talk. And by that, I mean talking about trash in the literal sense! And yet the issue of trash and waste in general is one that affects us all, touching on matters of public health, social cohesion and tourism, amongst others!|1
(Host) Two groups involved with mental health care want to know which Vermont doctors got thousands of dollars last year in gifts from drug companies. The companies can withhold some of the names under a law that protects trade secrets. The groups say that loophole should be closed. (Dillon) Last year, physicians and other health care providers in Vermont got about $3.1 million dollars in gifts from pharmaceutical companies. Vermont is one of a few states that require the drug companies to disclose these kinds of marketing expenses. The payments include consulting fees, travel, gifts and money for lectures.|1
A communications professor at Texas A & M University wanted to find out about the effects of changes to the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate. What is a health plan? Well, in theory, it allows for insurance coverage for all people, including employees who are under age 55 or disabled. But what exactly does this mean? In practice, it doesn't seem quite right. Here's what you need to understand. The Supreme Court today rejected a lawsuit filed by an anti-abortion group challenging President Obama's executive order protecting birth control coverage from the federal government.|0
Want to end the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the government has been able to stop some of its best leaks.

First, we looked at which major brands cost the most to maintain over the first 10 years of a new service. We also looked at how long their networks were available in New York City and found that the average customer spends about 35 hours per month paying for Netflix in those areas. After President Donald Trump released his revised travel ban, there was an immediate backlash from many lawmakers. Some called for Congress to rewrite the executive order without Congressional oversight. But others said the changes would hurt businesses, workers, and communities.|0

The first time I heard these verses was in a small storefront church in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember because it was the same Sunday morning that Princess Diana’s tragic death was reported. I had recently left my job on Wall Street and was living in Kiev with my mother after my father had passed away and I was there because I was not having much luck in finding my way forward. I recall the wood-paneled walls of the room where I sat in the back, slightly embarrassed by the evangelical enthusiasm of my fellow expats. But when I heard these verses my wandering mind was drawn back.|1

The area's population has ballooned from about 3,000 to 6,000 people this year, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service records.The city of Delray Beach has had a particularly difficult time keeping up with changing demographics.

It was a Saturday morning. August. I remember it vividly. I was online, sat up in bed, browsing, not looking for anything in particular. An article caught my eye: it was about the refugee crisis. Men, women and children were risking their lives to get to western Europe, and many were dying in the process. It was a story of endurance and terrible trauma. In response I expected compassion, a swell of fellow feeling. But my heart sank as I read the comments. There was so much cruelty.|1

If the U.S. presidential election were resolved on social media, Barack Obama would be the clear winner this year in the race to be reelected President by a large majority of Americans.

Manatees are large, gray aquatic mammals.

The carrier operates 744 mainline planes that vary in size, carrying 50 to 366 passengers each. For a typical 737 plane carrying 179 passengers, the reduction would mean about 11 pounds per flight.

Presumably that also means United was making less than $2.3 million selling the items in-flight or calculated that allowing passengers to pick them up at ground level would not dent its revenue significantly.|1

It was a Saturday morning. August. I remember it vividly. I was online, sat up in my car looking at my phone, looking at what I had been thinking about going through when I read that. I looked around and realized there weren't too many of them. They were pretty busy with all kinds of events on social media. I decided to stop by and see what they were up to. As usual, I ended up reading a lot of books over the course of the evening. The first time I saw some of these books was in mid-June.|0

The New York Knicks approach the quarter-mark of the schedule with a middling 9-9 record as they aim to end their 43-year championship drought. Coach Jeff Hornacek and the Knicks will have the upper hand against opponents in December. In the 15 games they will play this month, only five of those will be against teams with winning records. They’ll host the 5-13 Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday. Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose and Carmelo Anthony are arguably the biggest names on the roster, but they are not playing up to expectations.

To a watching world, the sight of Britain on fire this week has surely been shocking. The looting and torching has revealed an inner-city London, Birmingham and Manchester seldom glimpsed in the England usually offered for export via soft-focus period dramas, Hugh Grant movies or stories on Will and Kate. If the revelation has puzzled outsiders, it has confused Britons no less. The mood here is a mixture of rage, fear and bafflement. Not that we’re not used to riots: We are.

Less than two years ago, I was seated at a South Atlantic League baseball game (low A ball) between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers — Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were charting the game. As I discussed in this post, neither pitcher seemed destined to make the major leagues. Richards had been undrafted in 2015 coming out of a small college, and thus had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016 and he was pitching well for Greensboro.|1

When the theme of the convention seems to have been, “Drill, baby, drill,” which is an energy policy in exactly the same way that, “Tax, baby, tax” is a fiscal policy (i.e., it isn’t), slogans are obviously all that the party has left.

WASHINGTON, March 1 - Coming off a year of record-setting $ 1 billion-plus natural disasters, representatives of leading organizations in the United Nations are urging President Trump to commit to building a wall along the southern border with Mexico — something which, if it passes, would likely push more than 90 million people out of the country. The New York Times and the Washington Post today reported on plans unveiled by the White House to erect the wall between Mexico and the United States on a temporary basis that would cut off all travel to the country from the U.S. for seven days.|0
Northern Ireland was today branded the race hate capital of Europe, in a report on racist violence in the province. Human rights campaigner Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, was in Belfast for the launch of the report by the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (NICEM).

On Thursday, LightSquared submitted final arguments for its $ 7 billion dollar proposal to launch an LTE network. But it was opposed by many in the wireless industry who viewed it as unnecessary. Some critics called it anti-competitive or discriminatory. In August of last year, New York Gov.

Today, Governor Cuomo has said he doesn't support the bill and has not been able to sign it into law due to budget constraints.|0

That rule was adopted last year and has forced automakers to pay $1 billion in penalties for cheating. He faces up to two years in prison, fines of up to $25,000 and a fine of up to $150,000.|0

He said he expected “most of the market” would be launching 5G either side of a one or two month window period when it arrived.|1

January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are making progress is because factions with responsibilities for large chunks of the population are willing to compromise if that will help stem the accelerating decline in living standards nationwide.

Then there is all the Islamic terrorist violence. While most Libyans appreciate the help from Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Kaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become more of a menace than the Kaddafi era secret police ever were.|1

To involve private sector in healthcare, what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to ensure that hospitals, nursing homes and other primary care facilities serve the needs of patients. However, it may seem like an unrealistic aim. There are certainly some areas where private-sector efforts could succeed – for example, providing health insurance for those with disabilities, or providing services to people who need these services. These initiatives will likely require much more money and resources to do than we already have, but if there's a path forward then it will be worth it.|0

THE first acknowledgement of Brent Moloney's redemption for an after-match drinking binge came midway through the season when he was quietly reinstated to the club's leadership group. The second, much more public and significant than the first, came last night when he won Melbourne's best and fairest award. Moloney, 27, claimed the Keith ''Bluey'' Truscott Trophy ahead of key defenders Jared Rivers and James Frawley at a function at Crown Palladium. Two of Moloney's midfield teammates, Nathan Jones and Jack Trengove, were fourth and fifth respectively.|1

U.S. trade policy has become the top concern among chief financial officers, according to a CNBC quarterly survey. Roughly two-thirds of North American and Asia-Pacific CFOs say U.S. trade policy will have a negative impact on their company over the next six months.

U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin hit Capitol Hill on Thursday to face a grilling on trade, tariffs and NAFTA from the House Financial Services Committee. Mnuchin attempted to quell growing uncertainty within Congress as President Trump ratchets up a trade war with China.|1
Guess what? The NBA really is a showbiz affair. Only super-producer David Stern isn’t pulling all the behind-the-curtain strings (otherwise, New York somehow would have won the draft lottery). To the contrary, the league lurches along in the manner of an over-budget, out-of-control Hollywood spectacular — propelled by the ego of big-money players, rife with jaw-dropping plot twists, subject to endless rewrites. And to think: We haven’t even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers. Regrettably, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball.|1
An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco today to block a California law requiring police to collect a DNA sample from anyone arrested on suspicion of a felony. The law is part of a 2004 voter initiative that gradually expanded the categories of people in the criminal justice system from whom DNA is collected with cheek swabs. The four plaintiffs are challenging a provision that went into effect in 2009 and requires the DNA sampling from all felony arrestees, regardless of whether they are ever charged or convicted of a crime.|1

Fret not, however, as Nvidia has announced that its Android-powered streaming box will be getting support for Alexa control as well.|1

"Tech execs discuss the impact automation technologies are having on their organisations. For many organisations and their workers, automation can make a big difference in their ability to stay ahead of other technology companies. But it also means that it's not always feasible to automate at all, making it hard for new teams to gain the skills required to succeed.

Brands should resist the temptation to take on a hot-button issue in the Super Bowl as a way to stand out, said Aimee Drolet, professor of marketing and behavioral decision making at the University of California, Los Angeles’s Anderson School of Management. “It’s generally not the best venue for doing that because the audience is so broad, so invariably you’re going to piss off half the people,” she said. In other matters, U.C. officials announced that the 10-campus system had set a new fundraising record in 2017-18, bringing in more than with $2.7 billion.|1
Central American referee Carlos Batres has fallen for the worst dive of the World Cup by the most theatrical Italian since Federico Fellini. By doing so, he cost New Zealand's All Whites a famous win over football's reigning world champions. The scenes were reminiscent of Australia's defeat to Italy in the 2006 World Cup. Then, the 10-man Italian team scored an injury-time penalty after Fabio Grosso tumbled over defender Lucas Neill. Fabio Grosso goes down after a challenge by Lucas Neill during the 2006 World Cup. Make no bones about it - Italy, winners of four World Cup crowns, cheated to get back into the game.|1
to go on for years? According to analyses by Net experts, the mass-mailing MyDoom worm, which began propagating yesterday, is the fastest-spreading software virus to date with an effect that could linger for years.

The annual meeting of the Kelly Gang is normally a festive affair. The get-together, the brainchild of New York City lawyer Robert Peston, is attended by thousands of lawmakers and business executives. There's also a cocktail party to celebrate Trump's inauguration. But on Thursday night, when the session began, there wasn't much in the way of action. As soon as it started, nothing. It seemed like nobody wanted to know anything. We've all heard the story that President Barack Obama was born in Pakistan, but not many people actually realize the extent of the impact of his birth certificate.|0
