Want to end the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the act has metastasized into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has done much to shape the freedom of political debate in the modern U.S. What began as a vague statute that gave President Woodrow Wilson power to jail critics and censor the news media during World War I has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by policing secrets, not speech. Censorship did not end when the war did. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute.|1

"Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer wiped the floor with Wall Street 's third-quarter estimates , but one comment made by CEO Ian Read on Tuesday was a red flag.

The centerpiece of the rebuild is the warehouse, which was constructed in 1943, according to the date scrawled in concrete. It is made of wood. The roof leaks. There is no air conditioning, let alone a cold-storage unit for fresh fruits and vegetables. The warehouse should have been leveled years ago. But those at Poverello House trudged on, as they always have, doing a lot with very little. When it rains, it pours inside. The extreme temperatures spoil our food.

Study suggests complex behaviors were handed down for tens of thousands of years . Despite intense scientific inquiry , there is still little understanding of how human behavior develops from birth, particularly how we acquire speech, language and other complex cognitive abilities. That's because scientists have only been studying humans in real-time for a little over a hundred years. That's the question being tackled by a team of researchers in Sweden , who have reconstructed the DNA of a 700,000-year-old modern human. The scientists sequenced mitochondrial DNA taken from a 20-year-old woman whose remains were found in Sweden .|0

They say they should be free to donate whatever amount they choose, and they are arguing with pastors, writing letters and quitting congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teaching and rejected what has been a favored form of fund raising for decades.|1

As a veteran of the movement to combat climate change, I have been conditioned to expect disappointment. So when, as administration coordinator for Fossil Free Stanford, I was called into the office of the senior assistant to the Stanford University president in early May, I approached the meeting with apprehension. There were good reasons for my concern. That very morning, Harvard had arrested a student demanding an open dialogue on fossil fuel divestment. Last fall, Brown University flatly refused student calls to sever ties with thirteen of the dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policies at a national and international level had fared no better.|1

"Trisha Pollard believes the Texas social services system relies too much on the courts to police Medicaid fraud and not enough on a tool placed in its hands nearly nine years ago: criminal background checks. ""It just seems like something so simple,"" Pollard said Tuesday. ""People in other walks of life are routinely put through background checks."" The 52-year-old retired attorney stumbled across the issue last fall when she served as a Harris County grand jury forewoman. During her term, Pollard and fellow grand jurors returned indictments against two Medicaid providers, each of whom had a criminal past that included involvement in Medicaid fraud."|1

This was in spite of all the bombings that had taken place, the death of around 20,000 Syrians and the 200,000 refugees who had managed to escape.

The situation in Syria is indeed complex and difficult to understand for those of us from other countries.|0
January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are making progress is because factions with responsibilities for large chunks of the population are willing to compromise if that will help stem the accelerating decline in living standards nationwide. Economic activity is shrinking and shortages increasing because of the factional fighting and especially because two governments claim to rule the entire country. Then there is all the Islamic terrorist violence. While most Libyans appreciate the help from Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Kaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become more of a menace than the Kaddafi era secret police ever were.|1

New Zealand’s Abortion Supervisory Committee is appealing a High Court judge’s decision that said there is reason to doubt the legality of many abortions in the country. A registered practitioner may legally perform an abortion in New Zealand only if acting under a certificate approved by two consultants, who are appointed by the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The appeal also argues that the Court made a legal error in concluding that the committee can form its own opinion about the lawfulness of consultants’ decisions to grant or to refuse approval for an abortion.|1

Guess what? The NBA really is a showbiz affair. Only super-producer David Stern isn’t pulling all the behind-the-curtain strings (otherwise, New York somehow would have won the draft lottery). To the contrary, the league lurches along in the manner of an over-budget, out-of-control Hollywood spectacular — propelled by the ego of big-money players, rife with jaw-dropping plot twists, subject to endless rewrites. And to think: We haven’t even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers. Regrettably, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball.|1

Girls Like Biology , Boys Like Physics ? We all have our stereotypes about which subjects appeal more to girls and boys and some of them are true, but they don't really explain much. A new study takes a look at the differences in achievement and motivation between girls and boys in physics classes and shows that, in fact, a lot of the differences may have something to do with stereotypes.

While the world of finance had its fascinations, I grew increasingly disillusioned by the dominant narrative that it was always about the money, rather than any other considerations such as values and social impacts. They never registered on the radar. That's not altogether surprising, given the testosterone-fuelled dealing rooms and the fact there is very little connection between the decisions of City executives and their impact on ordinary peoples' lives.|1

The carrier operates 744 mainline planes that vary in size, carrying 50 to 366 passengers each. For a typical 737 plane carrying 179 passengers, the reduction would mean about 11 pounds per flight.

Presumably that also means United was making less than $2.3 million selling the items in-flight or calculated that allowing passengers to pick them up at ground level would not dent its revenue significantly.|1

According to analysts, the market is entering a consolidation phase after the recent run-up. NEW DELHI: A below-normal monsoon forecast by private weather agency Skymet proved to be a big dampener for stock benchmarks on Wednesday, which surrendered the day's gains after scaling all-time highs.

In response I expected compassion, a swell of fellow feeling. But my heart sank as I read the comments. There was so much cruelty.|1

The Bible teaches, “Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are led by various lusts (see 1 Tim.3:5-6). Many great people in God have fallen into fleshly temptations and potentially ruined their lives and ministries. One person has said, “It takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it.” This is a true saying! I believe one of the most important reasons leaders fall is that most have never intentionally set up mental and emotional firewalls.|1

Multiple bills at the New Jersey statehouse are of interest to truckers and others using roadways throughout the state. Repeat drunk driving offenders could soon face harsher penalties for their actions. New Jersey law now limits punishment for affected offenders to a traffic offense. Bail typically is set at $2,500. The traffic offense designation allows drivers charged with drunken driving to continue to drive while awaiting their court date. Awaiting consideration on the Assembly floor is a bill to end that practice. Instead, A3057 would boost punishment for a person convicted of driving under the influence two times or more within 60 days to a fourth-degree crime.|1

The best element of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film, Split - and one of the few things it did right - happened at the very end. The brief, surprising reveal of Bruce Willis reprising his David Dunn character from Unbreakable created a shared universe that Shyamalan was all-too-eager to exploit. Unfortunately, there's a wide gulf between teasing fans with a momentary appearance and building a story around it.

NEW YORK — Just before noon on Wednesday, Australian ambassador and president of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty conference, Peter Woolcott, released his final version of the global gun control agreement. Upon publication of the document, Woolcott informed delegates that they have 24 hours to confer with their respective governments and then report tomorrow for a final vote. For so many reasons, the United States delegation must choose the latter option. A few sections of the proposed agreement are provided below, each of which would require the federal government to unconstitutionally infringe upon the right of Americans to keep and bear arms as protected by the Second Amendment.|1
When George Orwell wrote â€œ1984â€ he included a vision of the future in which people would converse in a language of short sentences with lots of jargon. I have noticed this a lot lately as I listen to and read about our current presidential candidates. It seems to be a common thing for the candidates to repeat their talking points over and over. It is almost like the people are on repeat and we are listening to the same conversation over and over without ever progressing to the next statement. The campaign rallies are a lot of fun to observe, but there is no real dialogue happening.|0

Californians , of all people , should recognize what it means to drive people off their land . In the 1920s , they drove out most of the Indians . In the 1850s, they ran off the Mexicans .

"The response to the bombs by the crowd at the finish line was , I think , exemplary . Surely it shows the humanity of a great many more than those who had a camera phone to hand ?

Does the ‘perfect’ bourbon exist? In fact, for about 20 years, the distillery has undertaken Project Holy Grail: its systematic, clinical quest for a “perfect” whiskey.

Montana, Exxon-Mobil At Odds Over Oil Spill Montana and oil giant Exxon-Mobil are at odds over an oil spill in the state's Yellowstone River. Exxon-Mobil says it's doing all it can to clean up the spill and has promised to see the cleanup through. That's not enough for Montana's state officials — particularly its governor.

Less than two years ago, I was seated at a South Atlantic League baseball game (low A ball) between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers — Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were charting the game. As I discussed in this post, neither pitcher seemed destined to make the major leagues. Richards had been undrafted in 2015 coming out of a small college, and thus had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016 and he was pitching well for Greensboro.|1

From M1917 to M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps are on the cusp of a centennial—the 100th anniversary of the tank in U.S. service. This animated GIF, put together by the folks at partcatalog.com, shows the evolution of the American tank—from the clanky M1917 light tank to the M1A2 Abrams—and shows how the U.S. went from a newcomer to the world of tanks to world leader. The M1917 light tank, for example, was merely a copy of the Renault FT-17. That kind of copycat engineering is an idea that would be unthinkable now.|1

There are plenty of products out there that make it possible to create narrated walk-throughs of content , but most of them have serious limitations, especially the free/low cost options. In fact, in my experience, the only two products that come close to the feature-set I wanted are Storyline 2 and Captivate. Storyline 2 is great, but doesn’t handle branching as well as I’d like. There’s also the issue of needing multiple versions for multiple languages (and being able to do that on the fly, without rebuilding all the assets from scratch), which is an unreasonable ask, in my opinion.|0

The annual meeting of the Kelly Gang is normally a festive affair. The get-together, the brainchild of New York Post media columnist Keith J.

When the theme of the convention seems to have been, “Drill, baby, drill,” which is an energy policy in exactly the same way that, “Tax, baby, tax” is a fiscal policy (i.e., it isn’t), slogans are obviously all that the party has left. Even if you think that increasing oil exploration and supply through more offshore drilling makes sense, you cannot really take these people seriously. Unfortunately, yes you can.

Dec 25 (Reuters) - The Saudi market fell on Tuesday, as plunging oil prices pressured petrochemical stocks, while Riyad Bank was the top gainer, reaching a four-year high after saying it was in merger talks with National Commercial Bank (NCB). The Dubai index was the sole gainer of the session, inching up on the back of rises in its banking shares, with most major Gulf bourses slipping on tepid global sentiment and weak oil prices. Oil prices plunged to their lowest level in more than a year on Monday, as fears of an economic slowdown weighed on the market.|1
DARTMOUTH — On June 14 , Flag Day , the students of the James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth were given the opportunity to learn about veterans of all ages from across the country.

It was a poignant moment filled with pride for those who served in the U.S. Armed Forces. On June 21 , students at the James M. Quinn Elementary School, 45 Dexter Rd.|0
When the theme of the convention seems to have been , “ Drill , baby , drill , ” which is pretty much what the entire Republican Party has been all about since the beginning of time. I can only presume that the idea of a carbon tax has never been floated within the Republican party. The Democrats will not win a national election with Obama as their standard bearer. At least it is not something that he could do by himself. The Democrats will need to nominate someone from within their own ranks who can beat Obama.|0

"Veteran congressman Jim Leach (R-IA) went down to defeat in the massacre of 2006. I'm no apologist for ""moderate Republicans"" but it is worth saying that Leach was, in my estimation, fairly clearly the best House Republican. Nevertheless, one can only be thrilled with his defeat. That it happened just goes to show how fundamentally rotten the whole GOP scene had become. Leach was, in many ways, a person possessed of genuinely decent instincts and some fundamentally sound ideas about how the United States should conduct itself in the world. Nevertheless, in practice he was useless."|1

BlackBerry has decided not to renew T-Mobile's license to sell its products. A promotion that went awry last month has led BlackBerry to cut ties with T-Mobile after numerous years of working together. BlackBerry on Wednesday announced that it will not renew T-Mobile's license to sell its products when it expires April 25. T-Mobile offended the Canadian phone maker in February when it messaged its BlackBerry users with an offer to switch to the iPhone 5s for $0 down.

Recently, my elderly mother visited her bank located in Eastland shopping center in West Covina. On leaving, she was approached by a woman holding an infant asking for food money for her baby, claiming she had recently arrived from Italy and had no money or means of support.

NBC's Michael Isikoff reports. COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A single malicious email sent to workers at the South Carolina Department of Revenue last August enabled an international hacker to crack into state computers and gain access to 3.8 million tax returns, including Social Security numbers and bank account information, in what experts say is the biggest cyber-attack ever against a state government, according to details in a report released Tuesday.|1

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but also for that reason, an extraordinary case study for evaluating the mandate that should determine the relationship between the National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation. Ideally speaking, the national security set up anchored on Intelligence, exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security –external or internal –with the aim of neutralising it in time. At the same time, however, it does this on the authority of the elected Political Executive that is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy.|1

Without a doubt, the addiction drama “Beautiful Boy” – not the slasher-flick “Halloween” – is the most terrifying movie opening at the multiplex this weekend. Starring Steve Carell (“Foxcatcher”) and Timothee Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name”), the movie is a chilling and unsettling look at a young man’s plunge into meth addiction (and heroin, pills, pot, etc.) and a devoted father’s efforts to save him. It’s a true and horrifying story so powerful that an uninspired director and clichéd script can’t dilute its impact.|1
DENVER -- During the summer of 2002 , Colorado state officials were dealing with the 138,000-acre Hayman Fire while trying to find out how it ignited and what it could have done had it not been stopped when it was. Then the 127-square-mile West Fork Complex of three wildfires threatened the city of Denver. Now the state has to deal with the Black Forest Fire, which burned 50,614 acres of land and destroyed 389 homes as of July 4, 2013. The number of homes that were burned during the three-week blaze is the most of any wildfire in Colorado history.|0

Branstad is scheduled to take the oath of office at about 10:15 this morning. Branstad told a group of reporters and editors last week his wife, Chris, has urged him not to give a long, boring speech.|1
Trisha Pollard believes the Texas social services system relies too much on the courts to police Medicaid fraud and not enough on audits of providers. That may explain why she has filed a whistleblower lawsuit alleging that two major Texas Medicaid health care providers submitted false billing to the state health insurance plan. According to her lawsuit filed last month in Travis County District Court, the two companies -- the Healthcare Services Group and Medistar, Inc. -- overcharged the Texas Medicaid program for services allegedly not rendered. Medistar, which operates a long-term care facility, is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas.|0

While giant and spectacular circus shows now roam the Earth , it ’ s good to be reminded how they originated. The first circuses were not a million miles removed from the travelling fairs that roamed Europe in the 1500s. And they were certainly a long way off from the slick and modern circuses of the 21st century. Early fairs were held for various purposes: sometimes to promote a new play, sometimes as a place for traders and performers to sell their goods, and sometimes to simply entertain people who had come out to watch them.|0
Brazil is currently implementing the Brasil Sem Miséria programme — a continuation of the successful Fome Zero— which aims to do just that, Marques Porto says. Initiated in 2003 by former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Fome Zero is credited with having taken 30 to 40 million Brazilians out of poverty. One of the core actions of the programme was providing poor children with free school lunches, which were purchased by the state from family farms. In this way, support to local small farmers was provided at the same time as offering quality nutrition to children from low-income families.|1
Ken Block makes amazing gymkhana videos. But NSW Police didn't want Ken Block to make this particular gymkhana video — the one you see right up there — in Sydney.

Here's the video they made — the video that could have featured the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and all our most famous city's iconic landmarks. Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was filmed to coincide with the launch of Forza Horizon 3, set in Australia — so it made sense for Gymkhana Nine to be filmed in Australia.|1

A CANCER expert has hit on a way to kill tumours in two hours — using light. The technique involves a single jab with a chemical then a flash of ultraviolet. Cancer cells in lab mice were found to self-destruct, with up to 95 per cent dead in two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed the cells — which he injected with the chemical compound nitrobenzaldehyde — turned too acidic to survive. He said after patenting his “photodynamic” therapy: “There are many different types of cancers. “The one thing they have in common is their susceptibility to this induced cell suicide.|1

President Jacob Zuma believes that the public protector’s report on state capture was a political tool meant to be used to deal with certain individuals. In an exclusive interview with ANN7 on Monday evening, Zuma spoke out about the state of capture report by former public protector Thuli Madonsela, in which she recommended that Zuma establish a commission of inquiry into state capture and that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng choose the judge to preside over it.

PARIS (Reuters) - Longchamp, one of France’s leading handbag makers, plans to increase its presence in China, its chief executive said, in sharp contrast to retrenchment by rivals and despite the economic slowdown and changing consumer culture there.

It's been more than a decade since Eminem's one and only starring role in 8 Mile, and you would be fair to assume his acting career had begun and ended right there. But the erstwhile Marshall Mathers was in the running for years to play the lead role in Antoine Fuqua's boxing drama Southpaw, which, like so many other projects, wound up languishing in development. Now the project has been picked up by the Weinstein Company, and though Eminem isn't technically out of the running, he may be on the verge of being replaced by some of the biggest starts out there.|1

"Will Chelsea switch gears vs. Arsenal? Judging by his body language, you would never think Chelsea is only two points off the top of the Premier League table.

""We may have to take a step back in order to be more consistent at the back,” he said. “It’s something I don’t want to do, to play more counterattacking, but I’m giving it serious thought."|1

South Bend (IN) -- Thursday morning, the Irish took the practice field for the final time before Saturday's Blue-Gold game. One of the biggest questions the team faced entering spring ball still has yet to be answered: who will step up at linebacker?

He believes the position has made big strides over the last month and a half, but is in no rush to have everything in place with Week 1 still months away.|1

New research suggests mice with induced Alzheimer ’ s-like symptoms had improved cognitive function when given a synthetic estrogen-like hormone. In the study, researchers used a molecule known as CB-181276 to treat mice that were given a dose of amyloid beta proteins. These proteins are the ones that build up in the brain to form plaques, which are associated with Alzheimer’s disease. A study has shown that Alzheimer's disease could be cured using a simple synthetic estrogen, which scientists believe can help clear out the protein plaques that build up in the brain and cause dementia.|0

DELRAY BEACH — Overdoses are on the decline in Delray Beach , continuing a trend that started last year . But that doesn't mean Delray Beach officials are going to ease up on the war they've waged against heroin and other illegal drugs in the city.

ALBANY — Gov. Andrew Cuomo — who has two Twitter accounts with more than 863,000 followers — called the popular social media site an “elitist bulletin board” Tuesday and said he doesn’t look at it. “We created an echo chamber for the elitists to talk to themselves and, this little bubble of an unreal universe that banned political intelligence, believes is representative of the world,” he said in a WAMC radio interview. Cuomo has two Twitter accounts, one with 853,000 followers and the other with 10,400. He said during his re-election campaign last year, he was told by reporters to watch Twitter goings-on.|1

At a few smart legacy news companies, there’s digital advertising growth and smart strategy. But most newspaper companies are finding the important numbers are still headed in the wrong direction. By Ken Doctor @kdoctor April 24, 2014, 10:30 a.m.
As we approach the middle of the 2010s, where do newspapers fit in the battle for America’s largest ad sector — digital? And how well are all those paywalls doing? Two reports tumbled into the public sphere within a week of each other recently, and together, they help us answer both questions."|1
A local state representative is calling for fundamental reform of the state’s standardized testing system after the “litany of errors” he claims plagued the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2016. Isaac believes school districts should be able to choose from national standardized tests as the state fixes the STAAR test. When STAAR was last administered in May, issues regarding test administration, along with lost or late testing materials, glitches that erased test results, and mishandling of students’ private information have come to light, according to a press release.|1

The transplant took place Dec. 30 at the Lausanne University Hospital, and was performed by a team of surgeons led by French doctor Bernard Devauchelle and Swiss doctor Gerald Zangger.

A search for ‘ toxic mold ’ will result in hundreds of scary warnings and ‘ studies , ’ but few conclusive research papers that back up the claims. The mold that we encounter every day is a beneficial plant. It produces spores, which are reproductive parts that float on the wind to find new homes, just as plants do. Molds produce spores that float on the wind until they land and germinate to start growing on what’s available. The new plant will then produce spores and repeat the cycle. This cycle is what grows toxic molds.|0

This led to the establishment of a de facto military dictatorship (though there was a nominal civilian president) in the country for the next seven years, headed by Sergeant-Major (self-promoted to Lt.

When George Orwell wrote â€œ1984â€ he included a vision of the future in which people would converse in a language called. Orwell described Newspeak as “the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year”. Orwellâ€™s idea with Newspeak was to have a world where all shades of meaning were removed from language, which reinforced the total dominance of the State. Calling something one thing when itâ€™s the exact opposite also might be an example of Orwellian Newspeak, like calling a bill full of spending on liberal social programs an economic stimulus plan.|1

Two of Moloney's midfield teammates, Nathan Jones and Jack Trengove, were fourth and fifth respectively.|1

Manatees are large , gray aquatic mammals . They have fat bodies — I believe that “ husky ” is a more accurate term. They are the world’s slowest swimmers. They reach 10 to 12 feet in length and weigh about 1000 pounds. They are herbivores, living on plants such as aquatic grasses. The manatee has no natural predators, but it is killed by humans in collisions with watercraft or by entanglement in crab traps and shrimp nets . They are considered threatened species in Florida . The Florida manatee is named in honor of Florida , which has the highest concentration of the species in the world.|0

The likeliest of sources stepped up for the Boston Red Sox on Sunday. David Ortiz, never one to shy away from the big moment, jacked a three-run homer off Joba Chamberlain in the ninth inning to give the Red Sox a 5-3 win over the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. The victory snapped Boston’s five-game losing streak and stopped the club’s streak of seven consecutive series ending in sweeps. Ortiz’s heroics obviously put the Red Sox over the top. But there was much more to Sunday’s win, so let’s go over some notes from the nationally televised affair.|1
I have just been reminded of why I quit financial journalism after 11 years in the saddle , including a decade at The New York Times, five at Bloomberg News and five years at Barron's. It was not because of the money, which was good at all three venues. It was because it is a brutal business where it's easy to get run over and where it is almost impossible to succeed unless you play the game very hard -- and even then you can fall victim to other people's games. And this is before you even step into the brawl that takes place within newsrooms.|0

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre, but also dangerous. President Trump has been making the rounds of media outlets in an effort to put the record straight about what his administration is all about and what it plans to do. The problem for Trump is that since he started his Presidential campaign, there has been nothing that he has said or done that will not be scrutinized and critiqued by the American people, and more importantly, by the Democrats and Republicans alike.|0

PREBLE COUNTY — With two serious crashes involving young people occurring in Preble County over the past week, Preble County Sheriff Mike Simpson discussed summer driving practices as younger, less experienced drivers become more active during the summer. According to Simpson, during the summer roadways often become more active and younger drivers tend to be on the road more because they are no longer in school. “With kids out of school or kids back from college, there a lot more of younger drivers on the roadways going back and forth from events or work now that they aren’t in schools for 6-7 hours a day,” Simpson said.|1

The images we have published out of Yemen may be as unsettling as anything we have used before. Here’s why we made the decision to publish them. Amal Hussain is a 7-year-old Yemeni girl with a haunting gaze whose image sits atop our latest report from Yemen, a country plunged into war and on the brink of a catastrophic famine. Amal is skin and bones, and her head is turned away, as if she cannot bear to meet the eyes of those looking at her. Some readers may feel they want to look away, too.|1

Drones come in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes these days, but generally speaking, most of them still fall within one of two categories. There are those of the multi-rotor variety (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc), and those of the winged variety. Both categories have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor aircraft are typically more stable and easy to fly, but also much slower than wing drones that focus on forward acceleration. Conversely, winged drones can fly faster and further than their hovering counterparts, but are harder to pilot, since they can’t perform vertical takeoffs and landings.|1

An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco today to block a California law requiring police to collect a DNA sample from anyone arrested on suspicion of a felony. The law is part of a 2004 voter initiative that gradually expanded the categories of people in the criminal justice system from whom DNA is collected with cheek swabs. The four plaintiffs are challenging a provision that went into effect in 2009 and requires the DNA sampling from all felony arrestees, regardless of whether they are ever charged or convicted of a crime.|1

Is our efficient Tax Office killing this country? I’ve never seen a story where the Reserve Bank was urging the Government to give tax cuts.

"The main task of North Korea's junior minister for re-information is to refute everything ever said by French intellectuals. One year he did a special on Jean-Paul Sartre and began with Sartre's assertion that ""Three o'clock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do"". As it was a drowsy Friday afternoon, the junior minister simply made a quick call and renamed his local football team 4.25 Sports Club. This made Sartre look very silly indeed, because the club play all their matches at 4.25pm. In fact every time they play, their fans chant ""Are you watching, Jean-Paul Sartre?"""|1

The RBI has reduced the repo rate from 6.5 to 4.5%, and this was supposed to reduce the interest rates charged on loans by banks to 5%. However, what is happening is that the interest rates are not coming down, but are being pushed further upwards. The reason given by the banks is that they have a high level of bad debts.

Human rights campaigner Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, was in Belfast for the launch of the report by the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (NICEM).

Part two of Naomi Klein's report on the events that triggered a momentous new kind of politics in Argentina. Up until quite recently, Argentina pursued a policy of official amnesia when it came to the crimes of the Dirty War. Sure, the human rights non-governmental organisations still issued numerous scathing reports, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo still marched and the children of disappeared parents still showed up, from time to time, outside the homes of ex-military figures to throw red paint. But before the Argentinazo, most middle-class Argentinians regarded such actions as macabre rituals from a bygone era.|1

A search for ‘toxic mold’ will result in hundreds of scary warnings and ‘studies,’ but few are based in science—and many are motivated by profit. Recently a patient of mine was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well documented, but he adamantly denied that anyone had warned him to avoid alcohol. An initial confession of “a few drinks” turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact.|1
Multiple bills at the New Jersey statehouse are of interest to truckers and others using roadways throughout the state . A measure to raise the state’s gas tax has stalled because legislators are not willing to raise taxes.

Assembly Bill 783 would exempt diesel fuel from the state sales tax. The governor signed the bill into law, which will take effect in June 2016. The change is estimated to save truckers more than $30 million per year.|0

Manatees are large, gray aquatic mammals. They have fat bodies — I believe that “husky” is how clothing companies would attempt to get manatees to buy big jeans — that taper to a flat, paddle-shaped tail. Average adult manatees are about 10 feet long and weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds. Manatees are among God’s ugliest creatures in the ocean, and there are a lot of strange-looking seagoing creatures. Those are facts — well, the ugly observation is an opinion, but it’s obvious enough to be fact — that I learned from the Save the Manatee Club website.|1
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio isn ’ t visiting Israel until August . But that doesn ’ t mean he is avoiding the Jewish state.

The incline bench press is a strength-training move to build your chest and fronts of the shoulders. The move is performed in a face-up position on a workout bench set at an angle. You then grasp dumbbells or a barbell in an overhand position, and extend and bend your elbows to elevate the weight over your chest. Incline chest press machines that simulate the movement in a fixed plane are another way to perform the move. The incline press is one of several exercises that help create symmetry and strength in the muscles of the upper body.|1
Did Donald Trump Release Donald Trump’s Tax Return? For a moment, it seemed that Rachel Maddow was in possession of a genuine scoop. And then, all of a sudden, it didn’t….Thanks to MSNBC, the suggestion that Trump has “paid no taxes in 18 years” has now been definitively proven to be false. Moreover, Trump seems to have paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than did most political figures, and to have enjoyed a sizeable income to boot. Whether the report was cherry-picked we cannot possibly know.|1

Veteran congressman Jim Leach ( R-IA ) went down to defeat in the massacre of 2006 . I 'm no fan of his and he has voted with George Bush on Iraq and spending too much but I am surprised that people would vote for the Republican candidate Steve Rahr, who is in fact a liberal Democrat , instead of the guy who was in the majority of the Republican Party. It was more a referendum against George Bush than anything and I suspect this will be the same for the election 2008 . We have to be careful not to elect liberals .|0

Millennials are not a homogenous group of individuals, so a one-size-fits-all marcomms approach won't work. Millennials want healthy food and are willing to spend more on it.

And don’t try traditional advertising with them, stick to social media. If all of this sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a small glimpse of the countless contradicting reports on Millennials.|1

Yesterday a British Airways passenger jet due to fly from London to Dusseldorf landed in Edinburgh by mistake after the incorrect flight plan was given to its pilots.

Ballinhassig 4-17 Castlelyons 1-12: A polished second-half performance powered Ballinhassig to a comprehensive win over Castlelyons in the Cork Premier IHC quarter-final on Saturday evening. Inspired by Danny O’Callaghan and backboned by five members of the Cork intermediate team, the Carrigdhoun side displayed many of the attributes that may see them make a swift return to senior ranks. While the forwards will grab the headlines, it was the performance of O’Callaghan and the solidity of the Blues’ half backline that launched their second-half offensive and a return of 2-11 (2-10 from play) on the scoreboard.|1

WASHINGTON — South Florida has long been a laboratory for some of the nation’s roughest politics, with techniques like phantom candidates created by political rivals to siphon off votes from their opponents, or so-called boleteras hired to illegally fill out stacks of absentee ballots on behalf of elderly or disabled voters.

My daughter, a resident advisor at her college, recently groaned while mentioning that she’d likely get additional foreign exchange students to supervise this fall. When I asked why that’s a bad thing, she said the foreign exchange kids tend to presume Americans are stupid unless proven otherwise. They assume Americans aren’t as well-traveled, or as fluent in foreign languages or as knowledgeable about world cultures. I said what any Good American would: Why don’t they stay home, then? Oh, she replied, they don’t think our colleges are stupid.|1

A recent court case has the estate of the composer of “Taurus” claiming “Stairway To Heaven” is in violation of copyright laws. Creatives have been borrowing from each other for centuries. But what constitutes actual harm -- business, artistic, or otherwise? How much of the original art moved to the new effort? This is always the blurry part. Lawsuits over music copyright have been going on for more than a century.|1

WASHINGTON - RFK Stadium, the once and future home of major league baseball in the nation's capital, doesn't yet look like a field of dreams. It's configured for soccer, not baseball. The field must be replaced, and the dugouts, locker rooms and press box need upgrades. On a rainy day last week, a quarter of the field was mud and tire tracks.

ZAMBOANGA CITY—Terror is stalking residents of the island town of Pata in Sulu and it ’ s not coming from the seas, or from the mountains or the jungle, where the Abu Sayyaf group makes its hideouts. Today’s terror takes a different form: It’s coming from the jail cell of accused kidnapper Samad Surik, who is said to be holding 49 hostages in his tiny three-sided cell.

And for a team that is trying to make the playoffs, that’s a big plus. The Flyers didn’t earn a point in their second game of a five-game road trip, falling to 2-4-3 on the road and 5-10-3 overall.|0

As a veteran of the movement to combat climate change , I have been conditioned to expect disappointment . So the news that the Obama Administration’s proposal to slash methane emissions from oil and gas wells by 40-45 percent by 2025 came as a surprise. But not a pleasant one. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the new limits will save $14-15 billion by the end of the next decade, while the government would lose only about $1 billion in tax revenue over that time. The EPA is seeking public comment on the proposed rule through May 19 .|0

The new head of the national children’s hospital board has said it would be “bad business” for the State to allow the main builder of the hospital to step down from its role. The chair designate of the board Fred Barry, who is appearing before the Oireachtas Committee on Health this morning, also said that there was an “underestimation” from a very early stage in relation to what the project would cost, leading to an increased bill of € 1.73 billion up from the estimated € 800 million cost in 2014.|1

With the economy beginning to stall, Ben Bernanke's war on the nation's savers rolls on. A few of these funds even pay juicy double-digit yields — like the one my Permanent Wealth Investor subscribers have earned 20% on in two years. Dividend harvest funds: These funds buy shares in companies that are about to pay a dividend, and then sell the stock after the dividend is paid. By doing this, they can rotate through companies with different payment dates, and thereby achieve a high dividend payout. The problem is that shares generally trade lower after a dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend.|1

There has been a wealth of recent research that has demonstrated that dementia patients greatly benefit from participating in art and music intervention therapies. The benefits of the arts and creative therapy for individuals with dementias is now well established. Music is known to enhance cognitive, linguistic and social functioning as well as to reduce depression symptoms in those living with cognitive impairments, such as dementia.

The first time I heard these verses was in a small storefront church in Kiev , Ukraine .

As I began to live my Christian walk more seriously, these words began to become very real to me. I began to experience the peace and comfort that only comes from placing my burdens into God’s hands.|0

The Internet has changed beyond anything could have foreseen just five years ago. It is no longer a browsing medium: it is full of Web 2.0 applications, real time communications challenges and a whole range of threats that are designed to piggy back on this new usage.

This Webinar will explain how Internet usage has changed and how your perception of IT may not match what your users are actually doing, resulting in your security controls being by-passed.|1
Syria: Why is Assad Advancing? In the Presidential elections held at the beginning of June, Assad was declared the winner with 88.7% of the vote. That is not surprising considering the nature of the regime. However, in spite of the fact that these were in no way “free” elections, and that many people could not vote as they were in refugee camps beyond the borders of the country, what emerged was that a significant section of the population is backing Assad. Why is this? Stop criminal attack on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli army embarked on a ground offensive into Gaza.|1

Edgar Wright has never made a bad movie. He’s never even made less than a very good movie, and so it makes sense that thus far in his career, Wright has shied away from straight-up sequels. However, that could possibly change with Baby Driver. When Shaun of the Dead was a massive hit, instead of capitalizing on that with a zombie follow-up, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost instead made a thematically connected trio of films—the Cornetto Trilogy—with the also excellent Hot Fuzz and The World’s End.|1

The life of the mind puzzles poets and neuroscientists who go about mapping it and labeling it, and, in my case, trying to find it. Thought itself is something to ponder in the Irish tradition and so, there are lots of concepts in the Irish language involving the mind, dreaming, and imagination. I'm only a student myself, so many of the nuances will be lost on me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear native speakers offer more sophisticated thoughts on the vocabulary of Irish thought.|1

A facility manager wears many hats . It isn ’ t uncommon for a facility manager to lead a meeting, write a proposal, do a walkthrough, meet with a tenant and write out a work order.

First, we looked at which major brands cost the most to maintain over the first 10 years of a car's life. We grouped all years of all models by brand to compute their average cost by brand. In order to estimate annual maintenance costs, we found the amount spent on every two oil changes (as oil changes are generally done every six months). German imports lead the list by a fair margin, which isn't too surprising. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners on at least $10,000 over ten years compared to a BMW.|1
A budget crisis facing the Palestinian government is deepening in the wake of last week's election victory by the Islamic resistance group, Hamas. On Thursday the Palestinian Authority (PA) announced it was delaying payment of January salaries to 137,000 government staff by at least two weeks because of post-election budget problems. The PA needs $116 million to cover the monthly payroll. But after Hamas' election victory last week, Israel said it was suspending its monthly tax transfers to the PA, worth about $45 million, pending further review.|1

The 30-year-old, who did not feature at the World Cup after an injury-disrupted season in 2017-18, joins Raheem Sterling in withdrawing from the squad.|1
New research suggests mice with induced Alzheimer’s-like symptoms had improved cognitive function when given a synthetic estrogen-like hormone. “This synthetic hormone improved behavior much the way that estrogen does,” said study leader Dr. Christian Pike, associate professor at the University of Southern California’s School of Gerontology. But unlike estrogen, which enlarges the uterus and is a known risk factor for endometrial and breast cancer, PPT caused no obvious changes to the animals’ reproductive tract. “This may be a promising strategy to maximize hormone therapy benefits and minimize its risk,” said Pike.|1
The response to the bombs by the crowd at the finish line was, I think, exemplary. Sure, many people fled from the explosions, and reasonably so. But a remarkable number ran, as they say, to the sound of the guns, even though when two bombs go off, one might well expect more. Many of these were professionals. The finish line of a marathon is a fortuitous spot to bomb, in that doctors, policemen, ambulances and so on are stationed there. Some soldiers happened to be on hand. But others were not professionals.|1

Really ? Was it this complex ? The Green Bay Press-Gazette reports that authorities say they are two to three weeks into a probe into the cause of the fatal crash and it could take as much as a year to learn what happened. They have recovered a cockpit recording that has been sent for analysis, but it could take several days to find out if it is usable, authorities said. They believe the crash was caused by pilot error. But they don’t know how. “It was a pretty violent event,” said Captain Mike Daly.|0

Arsene Wenger believes the return to fitness of England forward Theo Walcott and imminent recovery of Germany international Lukas Podolski will give him the extra options he needs for a sustained run in the Champions League.

However, Wenger’s biggest problem is his depleted squad. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is already out injured, Yaya Sanogo and Kieran Gibbs are likely to miss out this weekend at Southampton and Abou Diaby is also injured.|0
