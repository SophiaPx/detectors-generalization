DENVER (AP) — The nonpartisan administrator of Colorado’s state Senate has warned staff, aides and interns that policy forbids them from speaking to journalists about workplace issues — including sexual harassment. KUNC-FM reported Tuesday that Senate Secretary Effie Ameen sent two emails reminding workers that giving interviews to reporters is a violation of chamber policy. Ameen sent the emails in February and March as the Senate’s GOP leadership was insisting that sexual misconduct and workplace harassment complaints against lawmakers either be handled confidentially — per the Legislature’s workplace harassment policy — or by prosecutors.|1
Austria, Spain and South Korea have been approved as founding members of the Asia Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB), the Chinese Finance Ministry announced Saturday. A founding member of the bank has the right to help write its rules and Saturday’s additions bring the number of prospective founders to 41. The exact number of founding members will be finalized on April 15. Any country that joined the AIIB after March 31 will only be allowed to be an ordinary member, which means they have voting rights but less say in making the rules.|1
To involve private sector in healthcare , what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to increase the productivity of the sector. I do believe that public spending on social services will increase in the coming decade, but I am not sure at this point that we are on the same page here. I am in favour of a public private partnership in healthcare and think the private sector should be involved with the delivery. However, private providers should not have the right to charge for services. I don't know what they are asking the private sector to do.|0

When George Orwell wrote â€œ1984â€ he included a vision of the future in which people would converse in a language which had lost its meaning. In reality, many people are using the language without realising it. This is happening in a number of places, particularly on social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. The result of this is that people are speaking in a language that was not meant to be spoken and it becomes a bit of a joke. When I started writing this blog, it was intended to be a place to share thoughts and observations about politics, technology and society in Australia.|0
The new head of the national children’s hospital board has said it would be “bad business” for the State to allow the main builder of the hospital to step down from its role. The chair designate of the board Fred Barry, who is appearing before the Oireachtas Committee on Health this morning, also said that there was an “underestimation” from a very early stage in relation to what the project would cost, leading to an increased bill of € 1.73 billion up from the estimated € 800 million cost in 2014.|1
The Israeli ambassador and almost all staff have been evacuated from the country’s embassy in the Jordanian capital, Amman, amid growing fears of an assault on the mission similar to last week’s attack in Egypt. Fears of violent anti-Israel protests similar to those that erupted in Cairo were sparked following calls for a “million-man march” outside Israel’s embassy in Amman. The action, scheduled for Thursday, had been organized via Facebook. The motto, “No Zionist embassy on Jordanian territory” was published online earlier this week and has already attracted thousands of pledges to attend the demonstration.|1
New research suggests mice with induced Alzheimer ’ s-like symptoms had improved cognitive function when given a synthetic estrogen-like hormone. A study published today in the journal Experimental Neurology further confirms this, and suggests hormone therapy is worth exploring. Many women who experience menopause later in life are also at an increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease. The new study suggests that a synthetic hormone, which mimics the effects of natural estrogen on the brain, may help protect against Alzheimer’ s-like symptoms, and may even reduce the risk of cognitive decline later in life.|0

A local state representative is calling for fundamental reform of the state’s standardized testing system after the “litany of errors” he claims plagued the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2016. Isaac believes school districts should be able to choose from national standardized tests as the state fixes the STAAR test. When STAAR was last administered in May, issues regarding test administration, along with lost or late testing materials, glitches that erased test results, and mishandling of students’ private information have come to light, according to a press release.|1
"THE pound has surged against the euro and dollar as Theresa May announced plans to launch a snap election later in the year

Bucking the trend of a globalised economy, the pound was hit by rising interest rates from the Bank of England as the UK’s central bank raised its cash rate for the second time in as many months. The move also came amid concerns about Brexit, especially as the Prime Minister pledged on Thursday that the UK will leave the EU with a deal that brings in “real” trade barriers to stop free movement. The pound jumped on the news."|0
BASEL, Switzerland – Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG said Monday that it has had reports of 13 cases the H1N1 flu becoming resistant to Tamiflu, which it calls a very low percentage. A good sign is that the people who had the resistant strain have not passed the disease on to other people, said David Reddy, leader of Roche&apos;s Tamiflu pandemic task force. And the resistant variety has been like the widespread version of the virus in that it typically produces only mild symptoms. The 13 cases were scattered around the world in Europe, the United States and Asia, said Reddy.|1
Young African-Americans embrace computers as integral to their futures , but they may be missing out on key opportunities to build a career that is not tied to an employer or career path, a study has shown. Research by the Harvard Graduate School of Design found that African-Americans with degrees in computer science, information technology, or a related area are just as likely to use computers for research and other professional purposes, including employment. They are also less likely than white-collar workers to work in jobs that require a computer to be essential.|0

Michael Hoeppner had to shed his Manhattan street manners. We realized we were paying an arm and a leg in Manhattan. We looked all over. We got into this area, and the homes are stunning, and it just seemed nicer. The people who sold us this house live next door, Rodney and Desmond. They already had a couple of offers. I think partly what happened is that they wanted us as neighbors: a pregnant couple trying to get a first-time home buy. I’m sure probably that was more appealing than .1 percent more on the down payment or whatever."|1
The response to the bombs by the crowd at the finish line was, I think, exemplary. Sure, many people fled from the explosions, and reasonably so. But a remarkable number ran, as they say, to the sound of the guns, even though when two bombs go off, one might well expect more. Many of these were professionals. The finish line of a marathon is a fortuitous spot to bomb, in that doctors, policemen, ambulances and so on are stationed there. Some soldiers happened to be on hand. But others were not professionals.|1

If this was supposed to be a measuring stick game for the Flyers, they came up a bit short. Coming off a 12-1-1 dash since Jan. 12, the Flyers skated squarely into a wall named the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday night and it was a reality check. The team with the best record (46-11-4) in the NHL easily skated past the Flyers on the way to a 5-2 win at the Wells Fargo Center, sweeping the season series.

[ Written by Jonathan Starling ] It is not unusual to read and hear complaints about the amount of trash that accumulates during the month of December at your local community garden. Well, it is even more unusual to read and hear about a program that is designed to rid communities of the garbage that accumulates in their yards throughout December. I will not waste your time by giving you the exact program. However, I will make several observations about it. First of all, the garbage from your local community garden goes to the local landfill, and only the garbage from the garden is collected.|0

PREBLE COUNTY — With two serious crashes involving young people occurring in Preble County over the past week, Preble County Sheriff Mike Simpson discussed summer driving practices as younger, less experienced drivers become more active during the summer. According to Simpson, during the summer roadways often become more active and younger drivers tend to be on the road more because they are no longer in school. “With kids out of school or kids back from college, there a lot more of younger drivers on the roadways going back and forth from events or work now that they aren’t in schools for 6-7 hours a day,” Simpson said.|1

An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco today to block a California law requiring police to collect a DNA sample from anyone arrested on suspicion of a felony.

The four plaintiffs are challenging a provision that went into effect in 2009 and requires the DNA sampling from all felony arrestees, regardless of whether they are ever charged or convicted of a crime.|1

The images we have published out of Yemen may be as unsettling as anything we have used before. Here’s why we made the decision to publish them. Amal Hussain is a 7-year-old Yemeni girl with a haunting gaze whose image sits atop our latest report from Yemen, a country plunged into war and on the brink of a catastrophic famine. Amal is skin and bones, and her head is turned away, as if she cannot bear to meet the eyes of those looking at her. Some readers may feel they want to look away, too.|1

Veteran congressman Jim Leach ( R-IA ) went down to defeat in the massacre of 2006 . I 'm no hero, but what he said then and what he says now have been some of his best arguments in Congress against gun control . Leach' s vote against the assault weapons ban is not a vote for background checks, he says . It's not for banning weapons of war from military bases . And it' s certainly not a vote for gun rights, and he should have known when he voted to ban them in 2002 that his vote would come at a high price .|0
From M1917 to M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps are on the cusp of a centennial—the 100th anniversary of the tank in U.S. service. This animated GIF, put together by the folks at partcatalog.com, shows the evolution of the American tank—from the clanky M1917 light tank to the M1A2 Abrams—and shows how the U.S. went from a newcomer to the world of tanks to world leader. The M1917 light tank, for example, was merely a copy of the Renault FT-17. That kind of copycat engineering is an idea that would be unthinkable now.|1

It might not be the household name that devices like the Roku , Chromecast , or Fire TV are , but it’s easy to forget about these small, affordable TVs as well. Not everyone owns one, or can afford to, and so many companies are offering them for under $50 a pop, including Amazon, Roku, TCL, and Samsung. These devices are in high demand right now, not just in the market, but throughout the globe, and so it’s worth knowing a little bit more about how they are designed, and why they are so popular.|0

WASHINGTON — South Florida has long been a laboratory for some of the nation ’ s roughest politics , with the region’s history of black and Latino voting patterns often used against black politicians accused of racial and ethnic favoritism. With the prospect of the state’s own primary election next week, the issue will once again be front and center. The stakes could not be higher for Democrats, who are looking to regain their control of state government after being swept from power in the 2018 elections. With a statewide primary next Monday, the Democrats hope to flip two seats in the Florida House in November.|0

First, we looked at which major brands cost the most to maintain over the first 10 years of a car's life. We grouped all years of all models by brand to compute their average cost by brand. In order to estimate annual maintenance costs, we found the amount spent on every two oil changes (as oil changes are generally done every six months). German imports lead the list by a fair margin, which isn't too surprising. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners on at least $10,000 over ten years compared to a BMW.|1

The centerpiece of the rebuild is the warehouse, which was constructed in 1943, according to the date scrawled in concrete. It is made of wood. The roof leaks. There is no air conditioning, let alone a cold-storage unit for fresh fruits and vegetables. The warehouse should have been leveled years ago.

A budget crisis facing the Palestinian government is deepening in the wake of last week 's election victory by the Hamas movement in Gaza. Over the last five years, the Hamas government in Gaza has been responsible for imposing a severe economic siege on the Palestinian people, forcing thousands of families to live in crowded refugee camps. While the Hamas government's control of Gaza is a key factor, the Israeli occupation has also played a major role in Hamas' economic policies, with the Israeli blockade of the Strip and economic sanctions crippling the Hamas regime in Gaza.|0

According to analysts, the market is entering a consolidation phase after the recent run-up. NEW DELHI: A below-normal monsoon forecast by private weather agency Skymet proved to be a big dampener for stock benchmarks on Wednesday, which surrendered the day's gains after scaling all-time highs.

The New York Knicks approach the quarter-mark of the schedule with a middling 9-9 record as they aim to end their 43-year championship drought. Coach Jeff Hornacek and the Knicks will have the upper hand against opponents in December. In the 15 games they will play this month, only five of those will be against teams with winning records. They’ll host the 5-13 Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday. Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose and Carmelo Anthony are arguably the biggest names on the roster, but they are not playing up to expectations.

Prior to being elected governor in 2010, Branstad served as Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota, where he became known for his liberal views on many issues, including abortion and same-sex marriage.|0

It was a Saturday morning. August. I remember it vividly. I was online, sat up in bed, browsing, not looking for anything in particular. An article caught my eye: it was about the refugee crisis. Men, women and children were risking their lives to get to western Europe, and many were dying in the process. It was a story of endurance and terrible trauma. In response I expected compassion, a swell of fellow feeling. But my heart sank as I read the comments. There was so much cruelty.|1

ZAMBOANGA CITY—Terror is stalking residents of the island town of Pata in Sulu and it ’ s not coming from the government. This is because the “Islamic State, also known as ISIS,” is not an Islamic State—not at all. The group was born as an offshoot of the radical Al-Qaeda movement. It was originally called Nusra Front but in May 2014, the group was renamed to its current name. According to the State Department, ISIS is not a terrorist group. It is a terrorist organization.

"SANTA MARIA, Brazil – Penny-pinching by a band known for its onstage pyrotechnic displays may have cost more than 230 people their lives at a nightclub in southern Brazil, according to a state police inspector leading the investigation into this weekend&apos;s deadly blaze. Inspector Marcelo Arigony told reporters at a news conference Tuesday that members of the band knowingly purchased flares meant for outdoor use because they cost a mere $1.25 a piece, compared with the $35 price tag for an indoor flare.

"Will Chelsea switch gears vs. Arsenal? Judging by his body language, you would never think Chelsea is only two points off the top of the Premier League table. After an extra-time defeat to Sunderland in Tuesday’s Capital One Cup quarterfinal, Jose Mourinho cut a bedraggled figure, a strange mixture of irritability, weariness and defiance. ""We may have to take a step back in order to be more consistent at the back,” he said. “It’s something I don’t want to do, to play more counterattacking, but I’m giving it serious thought."|1
Scout Gil Brandt of the Dallas Cowboys , the last member of the original group that built the Cowboys from an afterthought to a Super Bowl contender , is on a mission to make sure the Super Bowl isn’t taken away from Dallas this time around.

Can you put a price on faith? That is the question churchgoers are asking as the tradition of tithing -- giving 10% of your income to the church -- is increasingly challenged. Opponents of tithing say it is a misreading of the Bible, a practice created by man, not God. They say they should be free to donate whatever amount they choose, and they are arguing with pastors, writing letters and quitting congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teaching and rejected what has been a favored form of fund raising for decades.|1
A search for ‘toxic mold’ will result in hundreds of scary warnings and ‘studies,’ but few are based in science—and many are motivated by profit. Recently a patient of mine was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well documented, but he adamantly denied that anyone had warned him to avoid alcohol. An initial confession of “a few drinks” turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact.|1

For small businesses that sell on credit, accounts receivable can make up a substantial portion of the balance sheet. During the annual audit, auditors will check to see if your claims regarding the accounts receivable balance can be proved. These claims are known as assertions. The most common audit procedure related to accounts receivable is confirmation, in which the auditor will ask your customers to confirm their account balance. Knowing which assertions can be proved by confirmation can help you understand why your auditor asks for multiple audit procedures on the same account. Accounts receivable confirmations mainly serve to prove the existence assertion.|1

Study suggests complex behaviors were handed down for tens of thousands of years . Despite intense scientific inquiry , there is still no agreement about the meaning of these behaviors. What is clear is that behaviors such as flapping wings, crawling, and jumping are relatively recent innovations that are part of our modern evolutionary history. The behavior of jumping appears to have been in common use since the late Mesozoic. By the Middle Eocene the ancestors of modern bats were making the jump up to 5–20 meters, and bats were using the jump to hunt birds. By the Eocene–Miocene boundary jump-making was no longer the primary source of energy.|0

Without a doubt, the addiction drama “Beautiful Boy” – not the slasher-flick “Halloween” – is the most terrifying movie opening at the multiplex this weekend.

It’s a true and horrifying story so powerful that an uninspired director and clichéd script can’t dilute its impact.|1

That does not mean you are once and for all a neo-Nazi. You can have a change of heart and a change of mind, and come clean. If you want people to believe you are no longer a neo-Nazi, you have a lot of convincing to do. It takes a lot of work to shake the brown shirt.|1

New Zealand’s Abortion Supervisory Committee is appealing a High Court judge’s decision that said there is reason to doubt the legality of many abortions in the country. A registered practitioner may legally perform an abortion in New Zealand only if acting under a certificate approved by two consultants, who are appointed by the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The appeal also argues that the Court made a legal error in concluding that the committee can form its own opinion about the lawfulness of consultants’ decisions to grant or to refuse approval for an abortion.|1

Drones come in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes these days, but generally speaking, most of them still fall within one of two categories. There are those of the multi-rotor variety (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc), and those of the winged variety. Both categories have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor aircraft are typically more stable and easy to fly, but also much slower than wing drones that focus on forward acceleration. Conversely, winged drones can fly faster and further than their hovering counterparts, but are harder to pilot, since they can’t perform vertical takeoffs and landings.|1

""Something happens when everybody finds out/ See the vultures circlin', dark clouds/ Love's a fragile little flame it can burn out,"" she sings. Just hang in there, HarriSwift."|1

There has been a wealth of recent research that has demonstrated that dementia patients greatly benefit from participating in art therapy. While many might think that eating right and exercise are the keys to aging well, the Journal of International Psychogeriatrics has found that certain personality traits can make a huge impact on your life as you age, too. We all have busy lives, but if you’ve recently moved your loved one into an assisted living home, or memory care cottage, it is even more important to stay connected to them.

Girls Like Biology , Boys Like Physics ? We all have our stereotypes about which subjects appeal more to girls than boys. We’d be surprised to hear that these stereotypes were accurate. But what we do know is that many of these stereotypes stem from our lack of understanding of scientific principles. In the beginning we didn’t think that the world of science was a real world to explore, let alone understand. We thought it was just another field of study where you learned all about the theory of gravity and atomic structure and all that other mumbo jumbo.|0

Guess what? The NBA really is a showbiz affair. Only super-producer David Stern isn’t pulling all the behind-the-curtain strings (otherwise, New York somehow would have won the draft lottery). To the contrary, the league lurches along in the manner of an over-budget, out-of-control Hollywood spectacular — propelled by the ego of big-money players, rife with jaw-dropping plot twists, subject to endless rewrites. And to think: We haven’t even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers. Regrettably, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball.|1

If the U.S. presidential election were resolved on social media , Barack Obama would be the clear winner this year. Social media is the internet’s latest battleground. But it can also be its most powerful tool. In a recent conversation, I discussed the ways in which online platforms can use their enormous reach to affect elections. In the weeks before the 2008 presidential election, Facebook, Twitter and the other social media giants (Google and Bing in the US) created “super-accounts.” They allowed anyone to create their own virtual persona and, in a few minutes of work, to connect with millions of followers.|0

Maenga is disappointed over your press release against the statement of apology from UTM president Saulos Chilima. If you think Malawi is living the past where your police lied to the country that Robert Chasowa committed suicide when in true sense your party killed him, you are mistakenly wrong.

Upon growing pressure the president instructed Mgeme Kalirani to craft a statement that did not address what the nation expected.

DELRAY BEACH — Overdoses are on the decline in Delray Beach, continuing a trend that started last year. The latest data collected by the Delray Beach Police Department shows there were fewer citywide drug overdoses in March than that time frame last year and in 2016, when there was a record-breaking number of reported overdoses.

Forget announcing your latest album with a gigantic, budget-crippling open-air concert - Oasis have been hiring street musicians to do the heavy promo work for them. A gaggle of buskers and street performers were collected on Friday to perform new Oasis songs at various sites around Manhattan.

From subway platforms to park clearings, they played across the five boroughs – even in the pouring rain. Thoth and Dominic Del Principe were some of those who got rained on.|1
After the Chiefs’ season came to an end in the AFC Championship Game, Dee Ford said he has no problem with the team using the franchise tag to keep him in the fold in 2019. The Chiefs have not made any announcements about their plans on that front, but it certainly sounds like there are no plans to let Ford get away this offseason. The defensive look is expected to change with Steve Spagnuolo taking over as defensive coordinator for Bob Sutton, but pass rushers are always at a premium and General Manager Brett Veach didn’t sound like he’s preparing to say goodbye to Ford.|1

A budget crisis facing the Palestinian government is deepening in the wake of last week's election victory by the Islamic resistance group, Hamas. On Thursday the Palestinian Authority (PA) announced it was delaying payment of January salaries to 137,000 government staff by at least two weeks because of post-election budget problems.

When George Orwell wrote â€œ1984â€ he included a vision of the future in which people would converse in a language called. Orwell described Newspeak as “the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year”. Orwellâ€™s idea with Newspeak was to have a world where all shades of meaning were removed from language, which reinforced the total dominance of the State. Calling something one thing when itâ€™s the exact opposite also might be an example of Orwellian Newspeak, like calling a bill full of spending on liberal social programs an economic stimulus plan.|1

How the internet has caught up with the ways of the world. The early web: UNIX command was beautiful if you knew what to do. This month, the World Wide Web turned 20, and its birthday was celebrated the world over. It was a pleasant change since the medium, once a new frontier of hope, has been regarded with suspicion ever since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. We had spent years outraging over the possibility that our choice of washing machines and underwear was being conditioned by smart web advertising, and, in 2018, we learned that even voter choice was open to manipulation.|1

WASHINGTON - RFK Stadium, the once and future home of major league baseball in the nation's capital, doesn't yet look like a field of dreams. It's configured for soccer, not baseball. The field must be replaced, and the dugouts, locker rooms and press box need upgrades. On a rainy day last week, a quarter of the field was mud and tire tracks. It looked like Vince Lombardi should be coaching football here - which he once did for the Washington Redskins. But that was in 1969.|1

Dundee has long been a city of rich character, great wealth and extreme poverty. If the new V&A can give it a transformational boost, it will be worth every penny. I declare an interest. I went to the embryonic Dundee University in the last year it was a college of St Andrews and, like many whose lives were touched by the city, I have retained a strong affection for place and people. Not everyone grew to love it. In these days, “clearing” sent hordes of last-minute placements to what they fondly anticipated as the cloistered life of Queen’s College, St Andrews.|1

Less than two years ago , I was seated at a South Atlantic League baseball game ( low A ball ) between two teams from the same division, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the New York Mets .

There were two teams, the Phillies and the Mets , who were playing on the same field for the third time in a row, and I was wondering if this has ever happened before.|0

The extraordinary mummified remains of a 50-year-old woman discovered in a fetal position is set to go on display at an art gallery in Cairo. It is the work of the Egyptian museum’s new curator of Egyptian history, Dr Ahmed Ali.

Maureen Wildes argues it is time to find out the true impact of the Vietnam War on the veterans 'battalions' of the American military. But first, let's take a look at what exactly the Vietnam War was and exactly how the Vietnam War affected America. I began my career as an Army intelligence analyst in 1971 as a part-time civilian in the United States. It was during the Vietnam War that I began to question America’s commitment to fighting in a foreign war, particularly in the wake of the Vietnam War’s bloody, tragic escalation of the conflict.|0
Want to end the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the act has metastasized into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has done much to shape the freedom of political debate in the modern U.S. What began as a vague statute that gave President Woodrow Wilson power to jail critics and censor the news media during World War I has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by policing secrets, not speech. Censorship did not end when the war did. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute.|1
Brazil is currently implementing the Brasil Sem Miséria programme — a continuation of the successful Fome Zero— which aims to end the world hunger crisis in Latin America and is expected to provide food to a billion people.

This will be done by providing them with loans, in exchange for which they will be paid back with food donations. In this sense, Brazil can be seen as the largest food-aid nation in the world.|0

The carrier operates 744 mainline planes that vary in size, carrying 50 to 366 passengers each. For a typical 737 plane carrying 179 passengers, the reduction would mean about 11 pounds per flight.

Presumably that also means United was making less than $2.3 million selling the items in-flight or calculated that allowing passengers to pick them up at ground level would not dent its revenue significantly.|1

When the theme of the convention seems to have been, “Drill, baby, drill,” which is an energy policy in exactly the same way that, “Tax, baby, tax” is a fiscal policy (i.e., it isn’t), slogans are obviously all that the party has left. Even if you think that increasing oil exploration and supply through more offshore drilling makes sense, you cannot really take these people seriously. Unfortunately, yes you can. This, by the way, was the moment when I completely gave up on the convention.|1

The life of the mind puzzles poets and neuroscientists who go about mapping it and labeling it, and, in my case, trying to find it. Thought itself is something to ponder in the Irish tradition and so, there are lots of concepts in the Irish language involving the mind, dreaming, and imagination. I'm only a student myself, so many of the nuances will be lost on me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear native speakers offer more sophisticated thoughts on the vocabulary of Irish thought.|1

Study suggests complex behaviors were handed down for tens of thousands of years. Despite intense scientific inquiry, there are still major gaps in our knowledge about early human life. One major question that remains unanswered: when humans were first capable of complex cognition? In other words, when did early humans develop sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as prioritization and cultural transmission, that we would recognize today? A new study in Nature addresses this; after six years of excavation, archaeologists have unearthed technologically-advanced stone tools that were created about 71,000 years ago.|1

Nobody asked me , but … if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization , subscribe to racist publications , attend rallies , buy their merchandise … then why would you not vote for them ? Why would you not, for instance, support those who believe that the Bible is a literal book, and that the earth is not flat, but rather is flat as a pancake ! As I said , why would I not vote for these people, who are more concerned with what the Nazis are doing to the Jews and blacks than the Nazis themselves are concerned with them?|0

The best element of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film, Split - and one of the few things it did right - happened at the very end. The brief, surprising reveal of Bruce Willis reprising his David Dunn character from Unbreakable created a shared universe that Shyamalan was all-too-eager to exploit. Unfortunately, there's a wide gulf between teasing fans with a momentary appearance and building a story around it. Glass, the third film in what has become a trilogy, comes across as a mix of half-formed ideas baked into an uneven casserole.|1

Multiple bills at the New Jersey statehouse are of interest to truckers and others using roadways throughout the state. Repeat drunk driving offenders could soon face harsher penalties for their actions. New Jersey law now limits punishment for affected offenders to a traffic offense. Bail typically is set at $2,500. The traffic offense designation allows drivers charged with drunken driving to continue to drive while awaiting their court date. Awaiting consideration on the Assembly floor is a bill to end that practice. Instead, A3057 would boost punishment for a person convicted of driving under the influence two times or more within 60 days to a fourth-degree crime.|1

It was a situation which baffled many around the world, let alone the passengers on board the British Airways plane. Yesterday a British Airways passenger jet due to fly from London to Dusseldorf landed in Edinburgh by mistake after the incorrect flight plan was given to its pilots.

I have just been reminded of why I quit financial journalism after 11 years in the saddle , including a brief stint at the Sunday Mirror , and what I would have changed if I had the chance. As a journalist working for a free market paper in an age of shrinking revenues and ever increasing advertising costs, it was simply not possible to support the paper financially. So, I simply gave them my support and left. No doubt they have been successful in some areas and not in others. But the fact they still exist tells us that, at the end of the day, people still care.|0

Ken Block makes amazing gymkhana videos. But NSW Police didn't want Ken Block to make this particular gymkhana video — the one you see right up there — in Sydney.

Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was filmed to coincide with the launch of Forza Horizon 3, set in Australia — so it made sense for Gymkhana Nine to be filmed in Australia.|1

Edgar Wright has never made a bad movie . He ’ s never even made less than a very good movie. But his last film, Inherent Vice, remains a very bad movie.

The movie is about an FBI agent who’s trying to follow a drug cartel from the inside by infiltrating their ranks. You may not know this about the film, but in the beginning there’s a scene in which you may not know this either.|0

A CANCER expert has hit on a way to kill tumours in two hours — using light. The technique involves a single jab with a chemical then a flash of ultraviolet. Cancer cells in lab mice were found to self-destruct, with up to 95 per cent dead in two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed the cells — which he injected with the chemical compound nitrobenzaldehyde — turned too acidic to survive. He said after patenting his “photodynamic” therapy: “There are many different types of cancers. “The one thing they have in common is their susceptibility to this induced cell suicide.|1

Manatees are large , gray aquatic mammals . They have fat bodies — I believe that “ husky ” is just an expression of this fact — which provide the necessary insulation for them in the cold of the waters. Their long, strong, flexible limbs enable them to walk or swim over land. They use their bodies to propel themselves by thrusting forward. They are most commonly found in the Southern Hemisphere, but are also found on the Pacific coast. The largest species of sea monkey is the sea monkey, or Galapago, which has an average body weight of 11 to 15 kg (24 to 32 lb).|0

Did Donald Trump Release Donald Trump’s Tax Return? For a moment, it seemed that Rachel Maddow was in possession of a genuine scoop. And then, all of a sudden, it didn’t….Thanks to MSNBC, the suggestion that Trump has “paid no taxes in 18 years” has now been definitively proven to be false. Moreover, Trump seems to have paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than did most political figures, and to have enjoyed a sizeable income to boot. Whether the report was cherry-picked we cannot possibly know.|1

Guernsey voters are set to elect politicians from an entire island constituency , rather than by the current district system. This is one of the biggest changes in the past few years , and it will be interesting to see whether or not it can make an impact in the short term. Grenoble used to be the only French town with more than 40,000 people . Today it has barely any residents, due to the high number of immigrants and retirees that have moved there. Many other French cities are seeing similar growth , and I believe that this will be the case in the future too, if the numbers keep rising.|0

The Bible teaches, “Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are led by various lusts (see 1 Tim.3:5-6). Many great people in God have fallen into fleshly temptations and potentially ruined their lives and ministries. One person has said, “It takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it.” This is a true saying! I believe one of the most important reasons leaders fall is that most have never intentionally set up mental and emotional firewalls.|1

Brazil is currently implementing the Brasil Sem Miséria programme — a continuation of the successful Fome Zero— which aims to do just that, Marques Porto says.

"Brands should resist the temptation to take on a hot-button issue in the Super Bowl as a way to stand out from the crowd

There’s plenty for marketers to talk about during the Super Bowl this year. Take, for example, whether it makes sense for them to get involved.

On one side of the issue, some marketers might argue that what advertisers do in advertising is their responsibility."|0

"As Conservative Party leader William Hague made his way through the flock of the faithful at a lunchtime rally Tuesday and an emcee introduced ""the next prime minister of Britain,"" even many of his supporters let out an involuntary guffaw.

With the economy beginning to stall, Ben Bernanke's war on the nation's savers rolls on. A few of these funds even pay juicy double-digit yields — like the one my Permanent Wealth Investor subscribers have earned 20% on in two years. Dividend harvest funds: These funds buy shares in companies that are about to pay a dividend, and then sell the stock after the dividend is paid. By doing this, they can rotate through companies with different payment dates, and thereby achieve a high dividend payout. The problem is that shares generally trade lower after a dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend.|1

WASHINGTON ( CN ) – Republicans heaped ridicule on Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood at a Wednesday hearing after LaHood suggested his department has “a pretty strong record” in fighting illegal immigration. Democrats and some legal scholars also derided LaHood’s position, saying he had a “chilling lack of transparency” in describing the federal agencies and programs that would have the strongest impact on immigrants who come to the United States. “I think it’s the height of irresponsibility not to have a comprehensive immigration strategy that actually addresses the needs of the citizens of this country,” Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said.|0
Led Zeppelin stole from the ‘60s group Spirit? And did “The Voice” steal from “American Idol”? A recent court case has the estate of the composer of “Taurus” claiming “Stairway To Heaven” is in violation of copyright laws. Creatives have been borrowing from each other for centuries. But what constitutes actual harm -- business, artistic, or otherwise? How much of the original art moved to the new effort? This is always the blurry part. Lawsuits over music copyright have been going on for more than a century.|1

"U.S. trade policy has become the top concern among chief financial officers , according to a CNBC quarterly survey . CFOs worry about high trade tariffs and retaliatory tariffs by other nations. They said the U.S. trade wars are ""fierce"" and trade deals are ""frustrated"" by Washington's efforts to impose tariffs on imports of U.S. products. Trump administration officials have repeatedly said that tariffs of up to 25% on all products sold to the United States will be imposed by the end of this month, and that they have not been imposed on Chinese goods that have not been proven to be harmful."|0
The Sparks added some much-needed inside muscle Wednesday when they completed a three-team trade with the Charlotte Sting and the Seattle Storm. On the trade deadline, the teams had been circling one another for weeks before they made the deal Wednesday morning in Phoenix. The deal is worth a little more than $3.25 million for the Sparks and a little more than $4 million for the Storm, but it's not going to be all that cheap for a team that was looking for a playoff spot for the first time. The move gives the Lightning a chance to make up for losing their top defenseman, Ryan Malone.|0

Edgar Wright has never made a bad movie. He’s never even made less than a very good movie, and so it makes sense that thus far in his career, Wright has shied away from straight-up sequels. However, that could possibly change with Baby Driver. When Shaun of the Dead was a massive hit, instead of capitalizing on that with a zombie follow-up, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost instead made a thematically connected trio of films—the Cornetto Trilogy—with the also excellent Hot Fuzz and The World’s End.|1

January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are making progress is because factions with responsibilities for large chunks of the population are willing to compromise if that will help stem the accelerating decline in living standards nationwide. Economic activity is shrinking and shortages increasing because of the factional fighting and especially because two governments claim to rule the entire country. Then there is all the Islamic terrorist violence. While most Libyans appreciate the help from Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Kaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become more of a menace than the Kaddafi era secret police ever were.|1

Stark County’s unemployment rate in August fell to 6.8 percent, the lowest it’s been since September 2008. For the first time since 2008, Stark County’s jobless rate slipped below 7 percent, and a variety of factors likely contributed to the decline.

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but also for that reason, an extraordinary case study for evaluating the mandate that should determine the relationship between the National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation. Ideally speaking, the national security set up anchored on Intelligence, exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security –external or internal –with the aim of neutralising it in time. At the same time, however, it does this on the authority of the elected Political Executive that is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy.|1

The first time I heard these verses was in a small storefront church in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember because it was the same Sunday morning that Princess Diana’s tragic death was reported. I had recently left my job on Wall Street and was living in Kiev with my mother after my father had passed away and I was there because I was not having much luck in finding my way forward. I recall the wood-paneled walls of the room where I sat in the back, slightly embarrassed by the evangelical enthusiasm of my fellow expats. But when I heard these verses my wandering mind was drawn back.|1

By detaining Haniyeh , Israel sent a message that Palestinian cash smuggling is coming to an end . It is the latest in a long line of diplomatic and economic concessions Israel has demanded of the Palestinian Authority. Israeli officials also say they hope that with Haniyeh in prison, Israeli businesses can expand their presence along the West Bank’s border areas. It is not clear what will happen once Haniyeh is released. The Palestinians have said they will try to take over land in the West Bank for an Israeli settlement, an option the PA is reportedly considering.|0
A rumored-to-be pregnant Kylie Jenner was finally caught in public. The 20-year-old was spotted at a construction site in Hidden Hills on Wednesday in a baggy black sweatshirt and sweatpants, accompanied by her best pal Jordyn Woods and Kris Jenner, TMZ reported. The Kardashian-Jenner family has yet to confirm Kylie's pregnancy, but multiple outlets, including TMZ, said she was about five months pregnant and expecting a girl with boyfriend Travis Scott back in September. Jenner did appear in a Calvin Klein ad along with her sisters last week, but her stomach was covered as to not show off a possible baby bump.|1
`` Of all the German surface warships , the British feared Bismarck the most . Her size , speed , power and armor made her formidable to the point of invulnerability . Bismarck would have killed several thousand enemy troops in one single engagement , and her speed would have made her virtually invincible in any type of campaign . She had the ability to outrun the enemy and even destroy his own ships with her ramming . And she had just a few of those . Now , we are in the twenty ninth year of the American War of Independence , and still the British are on the war path .|0

The Korea Offshore and Shipbuilding Association has released numbers confirming the expectations of many analysts: the number of actively operating shipyards around the world has fallen by more than 40 percent from what it was seven years ago. The study defined an active yard as a facility with at least one ship on its backlog. Active Chinese yards were down from 380 to 140 and Japanese yards fell from 70 to 60 over the same period, the association said. Even worse, the biggest shipyards in the world – DSME, Hyundai Heavy and Samsung Heavy – may well have empty space and unused capacity sometime next year.|1
Gaza is the world’s biggest prison. Nearly two million Palestinian people are locked up there by Israel’s military blockade. Last year, racist Israel killed over 2,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 547 children. The Pentagon rushed in more bombs when the Zionist state ran low on ­ammunition. Baltimore, similar to Palestine, is under a racist military occupation. The Baltimore police force — the sixth largest in the 26th largest U.S. city — treats Black people like prisoners. According to the 2010 U.S. census, while 72 percent of the Baltimore population are people of color, 46 percent of the police are white.|1
He looked the part in his denim and lean muscles . Many fans feel the nickname was an unfortunate byproduct of his off-season weight cutting and the fact he couldn't get much bigger during the 2010 playoffs. It also made it easy to say the phrase out loud, especially when he was playing on an elite team in New York . The Giants had the No. 1 pick in the 2012 draft, and after winning three straight Super Bowls the previous four years, many thought the team was primed for a playoff run.|0

In 2015, the office of the Kansas State Fire Marshall counted 137 firework-related injuries. The year before, nearly 40 percent of firework injuries harmed children 12 or younger. Municipality policies vary in Kansas and Missouri.|1
Can you put a price on faith ? That is the question churchgoers are asking as the tradition of tithing continues to decline, with many parishioners turning away from the church because they can’t afford the weekly offerings that are required of all Catholics. The answer to this question may well be “yes,” if we look to the source of tithing, not the Bible. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), an average of about one in five Americans are on Medicaid or Medicare. That’s more than 1 in 10 Catholics and one out of every seven people.|0
The overstuffed roster for X-Men: Days of Future Past just got a little bit smaller. Although Anna Paquin‘s Rogue was reported as being part of the sequel all the way back in January, director Bryan Singer now reveals that the character has sadly been cut out of the film altogether. Hit the jump to find out why.

Many people have a negative view of the ‘perfect’ bourbon because they do not like that a distiller used different methods to create the bourbon.|0
Without much fuss or fanfare, but, happily, with plenty of shoppers, Salisbury quietly reopened its central shopping centre on Saturday, almost three months after it became the site of an international incident. The Maltings, which connects the coach park to the city centre, has been off-limits to the public and shielded by safety cordons and tents since the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on one of its park benches after being poisoned. Market traders were moved behind the shopping precinct by Wiltshire county council while the decontamination operation was under way.|1

BlackBerry has decided not to renew T-Mobile's license to sell its products. A promotion that went awry last month has led BlackBerry to cut ties with T-Mobile after numerous years of working together. BlackBerry on Wednesday announced that it will not renew T-Mobile's license to sell its products when it expires April 25. T-Mobile offended the Canadian phone maker in February when it messaged its BlackBerry users with an offer to switch to the iPhone 5s for $0 down.

I have just been reminded of why I quit financial journalism after 11 years in the saddle, including a spell as a Wall Street correspondent. While the world of finance had its fascinations, I grew increasingly disillusioned by the dominant narrative that it was always about the money, rather than any other considerations such as values and social impacts. They never registered on the radar. That's not altogether surprising, given the testosterone-fuelled dealing rooms and the fact there is very little connection between the decisions of City executives and their impact on ordinary peoples' lives.|1
The tide is turning at Frankston, with the Dolphins scoring successive victories for the first time in almost six years with a 13-point win over Collingwood at Victoria Park on Saturday. Coach Simon Goosey had a five-year plan to transform the competition's whipping boys into finals contenders and the results are evident. Frankston knocked off last year's grand finalist Port Melbourne last week and held off a fast-finishing Pies outfit on Saturday. The key, said Goosey, has been getting players drafted into the AFL system. Michael Hibberd, Dylan Van Unen and Mark Baguley are at Essendon while Marcus Marigliani was on the Bombers' list in 2011.|1
It's been more than a decade since Eminem's one and only starring role in 8 Mile, and you would be fair to assume his acting career had begun and ended right there. But the erstwhile Marshall Mathers was in the running for years to play the lead role in Antoine Fuqua's boxing drama Southpaw, which, like so many other projects, wound up languishing in development. Now the project has been picked up by the Weinstein Company, and though Eminem isn't technically out of the running, he may be on the verge of being replaced by some of the biggest starts out there.|1

When I went to meet Bono at the bar of his hotel, I saw Richard Gere seated at a table with a gorgeous woman in a little fur jacket and a leather cap. Bono, on the other hand, had removed himself to a quiet back room, where he was keeping company with a plump, middle-aged white guy in a suit and tie. (Bono was wearing a T-shirt and a fuzzy sweater whose sleeve needed mending.) This was Randall Tobias, head of the Bush administration's AIDS program. The administration had just announced that the program was providing antiretroviral drugs to 155,000 Africans with AIDS.|1

Montana, Exxon-Mobil At Odds Over Oil Spill Montana and oil giant Exxon-Mobil are at odds over an oil spill in the state's Yellowstone River. Exxon-Mobil says it's doing all it can to clean up the spill and has promised to see the cleanup through. That's not enough for Montana's state officials — particularly its governor.

Brian Schweitzer about those accusations — and the steps the state is taking to rectify them.|1

For small businesses that sell on credit , accounts receivable can make up a substantial portion of the balance sheet, so it is important to be able to accurately determine the accounts receivable balances at any time. Knowing how much money the business has left is also important, especially in times when accounts receivable may increase due to sales or other business expenses. The best way to approach accounts receivable accounting is to first set your business' accounting software up in your own preferred way. For example, most software providers will allow you to input your own data, or export your own data from other business software packages.|0

"Veteran congressman Jim Leach (R-IA) went down to defeat in the massacre of 2006. I'm no apologist for ""moderate Republicans"" but it is worth saying that Leach was, in my estimation, fairly clearly the best House Republican. Nevertheless, one can only be thrilled with his defeat. That it happened just goes to show how fundamentally rotten the whole GOP scene had become. Leach was, in many ways, a person possessed of genuinely decent instincts and some fundamentally sound ideas about how the United States should conduct itself in the world. Nevertheless, in practice he was useless."|1

As a veteran of the movement to combat climate change, I have been conditioned to expect disappointment. So when, as administration coordinator for Fossil Free Stanford, I was called into the office of the senior assistant to the Stanford University president in early May, I approached the meeting with apprehension. There were good reasons for my concern. That very morning, Harvard had arrested a student demanding an open dialogue on fossil fuel divestment. Last fall, Brown University flatly refused student calls to sever ties with thirteen of the dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policies at a national and international level had fared no better.|1

Is our efficient Tax Office killing this country? I’ve never seen a story where the Reserve Bank was urging the Government to give tax cuts. But that’s exactly what’s happening now, which partly explains why our economy is going off the boil. In fact, the implication from this historically unusual tale is that the Tax Commissioner, Chris Jordan and his team have been doing such a great job cracking down on excessive deductions claims, especially from business. Because of the productivity delivered via computer technology, the tax take for Government is surging.|1

But buried somewhere in the pile of public documents I eventually obtained, a single email — from a single individual — helped provide a fuller answer.|1

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but dangerous for this nation. The US and the FBI have not just been accused by many as being complicit in the Trump campaign and administration’s illegal activities, but also to have been complicit in the Russian government’s interference. The Trump team even accused the UK intelligence services, which had not even done their job properly, of trying to bring down this country’s democratically elected President. This is outrageous!

But with just under six hours to go, the plane was forced to make an emergency descent in order to make a landing on a runway at Gatwick, England. The plane was making a forced descent after a series of technical faults, but it was unable to make the landing on its final approach and had to be forced down.|0
VIDEO: On March 30, 2017, Atlanta drivers on I-85 north found themselves in a stunning situation when materials stored beneath the interstate overpass spanning Piedmont Road and Monroe Drive caught fire. The overpass then collapsed. Despite the 2017 I-85 bridge collapse that threw Atlanta into a two-month traffic nightmare — or the massive sinkholes that have erupted around town — Georgia infrastructure is actually among the very best in the nation. That’s according to researchers over at 24/7 Wall Street, who created an index using the share of potentially hazardous bridges, roads or dams to identify which states fare worst of all when it comes to infrastructure.|1

There are plenty of products out there that make it possible to create narrated walk-throughs of content , but most of them seem like a little out of reach for beginners. Why? It’s because a narrated story is one of the least complex types of content, as there’s no editing required to tell a story. It is, in essence, a recording of what you’re seeing in real-time, as you’re moving your cursor around. It doesn’t even matter how you got there: a story is created by the writer, not the editor.|0

WASHINGTON (CN) – Republicans heaped ridicule on Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood at a Wednesday hearing after LaHood suggested that bicycling and walking are just as good ways to get around as cars. To laughter, Republican House members suggested LaHood was taking drugs, dismissed the very idea of bike lanes and derided any change to a car-dependent society. “What job is going to be created by having a bike lane?” asked Ohio Republican Steven LaTourette. He suggested that environmental sustainability projects have “stolen” $300 million from other programs and to attacked LaHood’s encouragement of bicycling, on a personal level.|1

[Written by Jonathan Starling] It is not unusual to read and hear complaints about the amount of trash talk that the two main parties indulge, a phenomenon which seems to be magnified during election campaigns. And yet, seldom do these two parties actively seek to engage in real trash talk. And by that, I mean talking about trash in the literal sense! And yet the issue of trash and waste in general is one that affects us all, touching on matters of public health, social cohesion and tourism, amongst others!|1

Will Chelsea switch gears vs. Arsenal ? Judging by his body language , you would never think Chelsea is only aiming for an FA Cup fourth round tie vs. Arsenal, but in this instance, it is absolutely correct. It seems that the English side has the same philosophy as their European opponents.

That is no easy task against a team like Arsenal , and Chelsea will need to do well in order to win the game.|0

Trisha Pollard believes the Texas social services system relies too much on the courts to police Medicaid fraud and not enough on prosecutors. The San Antonio Express-News/The Dallas Morning News/The Austin-American Statesman published the results of a survey in December. One of the most disturbing findings was that nearly half of those responding believed fraud in Texas’ Medicaid program is most often committed by medical professionals. One-third of that number thought it was by a non-physician who is not a medical doctor. Pollard thinks that a criminal prosecution is the best way to bring criminal charges for Medicaid fraud, even if there are no eyewitnesses.|0
"Trisha Pollard believes the Texas social services system relies too much on the courts to police Medicaid fraud and not enough on a tool placed in its hands nearly nine years ago: criminal background checks. ""It just seems like something so simple,"" Pollard said Tuesday. ""People in other walks of life are routinely put through background checks."" The 52-year-old retired attorney stumbled across the issue last fall when she served as a Harris County grand jury forewoman. During her term, Pollard and fellow grand jurors returned indictments against two Medicaid providers, each of whom had a criminal past that included involvement in Medicaid fraud."|1

( Newser ) – After a car fatally hit a 70-year-old pedestrian , the driver 's insurance company sought payment for the $300,000 he stole. A jury awarded the man $600,000.

In the case, which is now before the courts on appeal, the man's lawyers said the judge erred by taking the insurance company's word that the money was stolen.|0

Manatees are large, gray aquatic mammals. They have fat bodies — I believe that “husky” is how clothing companies would attempt to get manatees to buy big jeans — that taper to a flat, paddle-shaped tail. Average adult manatees are about 10 feet long and weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds. Manatees are among God’s ugliest creatures in the ocean, and there are a lot of strange-looking seagoing creatures. Those are facts — well, the ugly observation is an opinion, but it’s obvious enough to be fact — that I learned from the Save the Manatee Club website.|1

January 29 , 2015 : Follow the money . One reason the new peace talks are making progress is because the Palestinian factions have decided that the best deal for the Palestinians, and therefore for themselves, will come from the Israeli government after the peace talks have gone their way. That’s because the Palestinian leadership will accept the settlement of the two-state equation only if Israel agrees to a full Palestinian state that will include all of East Jerusalem al-Quds (that means, of course, the Temple Mount, the Western Wall, and the Gaza Strip).|0

Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA) chief Iñaki Berroeta has sought to temper expectations about the imminent rise of 5G networks in Australia, saying although his company is forging ahead, he doesn’t anticipate consumer devices to be in market until at least the end of 2019. Berroeta declined to talk about any spectrum ambitions for Australian 5G, instead stressing that the new “ecosystem” for the mobile technology need to be put into place first before carriers started pushing product. He said he expected “most of the market” would be launching 5G either side of a one or two month window period when it arrived.|1

The Internet has changed beyond anything could have foreseen just five years ago. It is no longer a browsing medium: it is full of Web 2.0 applications, real time communications challenges and a whole range of threats that are designed to piggy back on this new usage. As a result, Web security has changed immeasurably - it's no longer enough to block, stop or inhibit IP sessions. Web filtering cannot hope to meet the security challenge. This Webinar will explain how Internet usage has changed and how your perception of IT may not match what your users are actually doing, resulting in your security controls being by-passed.|1

Syria: Why is Assad Advancing? In the Presidential elections held at the beginning of June, Assad was declared the winner with 88.7% of the vote. That is not surprising considering the nature of the regime. However, in spite of the fact that these were in no way “free” elections, and that many people could not vote as they were in refugee camps beyond the borders of the country, what emerged was that a significant section of the population is backing Assad. Why is this? Stop criminal attack on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli army embarked on a ground offensive into Gaza.|1
Part two of Naomi Klein's report on the events that triggered a momentous new kind of politics in Argentina. Up until quite recently, Argentina pursued a policy of official amnesia when it came to the crimes of the Dirty War. Sure, the human rights non-governmental organisations still issued numerous scathing reports, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo still marched and the children of disappeared parents still showed up, from time to time, outside the homes of ex-military figures to throw red paint. But before the Argentinazo, most middle-class Argentinians regarded such actions as macabre rituals from a bygone era.|1

Narendra Modi ’ s Election Challenge : Create Jobs . Lots of Them .

GENEVA – The Head of the UN Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, Justice Richard Goldstone, today urged the international community to put an end to impunity for violations of international law in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory as he presented the report of the Mission* to the Human Rights Council.

To involve private sector in healthcare, what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to reach out to more people. The nation has a new health policy after 14 years. The long gap itself indicates the priority, or the lack thereof, accorded to a sector that is in need of some urgent attention and has deep linkages with the nation’s aspiration to grow faster and emerge as a strong economy in the global order. The new policy has proposed seven key shifts in organising healthcare services, among them a welcome change in primary care from selective to assured comprehensive care with linkages to referral hospitals.|1

My daughter, a resident advisor at her college, recently groaned while mentioning that she’d likely get additional foreign exchange students to supervise this fall. When I asked why that’s a bad thing, she said the foreign exchange kids tend to presume Americans are stupid unless proven otherwise.

Oh, she replied, they don’t think our colleges are stupid.|1

The Hashemite Library remained a beacon of knowledge and a destination for readers and intellectuals until 2000, when the number of readers started to dwindle, given the tough economic situation in the Strip. In the 1950s, the Hashemite Library was commissioned to sell newspapers and books from prominent Egyptian publishing and distribution houses. It was also a space for writers and intellectuals to meet. However, the Internet’s invasion and the poverty of Gaza Strip’s inhabitants have inhibited these activities. “Due to the rise of the Internet and the economic stagnation, we no longer got books for distribution or sale.|1

The New York Knicks approach the quarter-mark of the schedule with a middling 9-9 record as they aim to end the season in the best possible manner. The problem with the Knicks? They’re still on the wrong side of .500, and as bad of a stretch in recent memory as this is for a franchise that was once a contender, the Knicks may be in trouble in a year that could see them slip into the worst stretch of their franchise’s existence since the inception of the modern Knicks, and that’s saying something.|0

DALLAS - Like many Americans , Martin Jacobson was overjoyed that Navy SEALs had captured and killed Osama bin Laden on Sunday.

To a watching world, the sight of Britain on fire this week has surely been shocking. The looting and torching has revealed an inner-city London, Birmingham and Manchester seldom glimpsed in the England usually offered for export via soft-focus period dramas, Hugh Grant movies or stories on Will and Kate. If the revelation has puzzled outsiders, it has confused Britons no less. The mood here is a mixture of rage, fear and bafflement. Not that we’re not used to riots: We are.
