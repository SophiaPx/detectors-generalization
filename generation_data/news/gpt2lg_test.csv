A search for ‘toxic mold’ will result in hundreds of scary warnings and ‘studies,’ but few are based in science—and many are motivated by profit. Recently a patient of mine was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well documented, but he adamantly denied that anyone had warned him to avoid alcohol. An initial confession of “a few drinks” turned into much more with a little probing by different medical providers. Despite his liver being in a significant amount of shock, he was stable and lucky enough to still have most liver function intact.|1

Multi-rotor aircraft are typically more stable and easy to fly, but also much slower than wing drones that focus on forward acceleration. Conversely, winged drones can fly faster and further than their hovering counterparts, but are harder to pilot, since they can’t perform vertical takeoffs and landings.|1

The Pioneer Woman Magazine, a joint venture with blogger and Food Network star Ree Drummond, published two sellout issues in 2017 and will double the frequency to four issues in 2018, Hearst Magazines president David Carey told staffers in his annual year-in-review letter. That’s a nice change for Airbnb, which tried on its own in 2014 to launch a magazine called Pineapple, which lasted only one issue.|1

Four-term Governor Terry Branstad officially begins his fifth term today. Branstad, a Republican, left office in January of last year.

Californians, of all people, should recognize what it means to drive people off their land. In the 1850s and 1860s, the state funded yearly expeditions that emptied entire areas of their Native American presence. But this is not only a historical phenomenon: In the West Bank, Israeli settlers and the Israeli government have attempted for decades to eradicate the small Palestinian village of Susiya. The village has existed near Hebron since at least the 19th century. In the 1980s, it was declared an archaeological site to enable settlers to move in and replace the former inhabitants.|1

Edgar Wright has never made a bad movie. He’s never even made less than a very good movie, and so it makes sense that thus far in his career, Wright has shied away from straight-up sequels. However, that could possibly change with Baby Driver. When Shaun of the Dead was a massive hit, instead of capitalizing on that with a zombie follow-up, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost instead made a thematically connected trio of films—the Cornetto Trilogy—with the also excellent Hot Fuzz and The World’s End.|1

The life of the mind puzzles poets and neuroscientists who go about mapping it and labeling it, and, in my case, trying to find it. Thought itself is something to ponder in the Irish tradition and so, there are lots of concepts in the Irish language involving the mind, dreaming, and imagination. I'm only a student myself, so many of the nuances will be lost on me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear native speakers offer more sophisticated thoughts on the vocabulary of Irish thought.|1

If this was supposed to be a measuring stick game for the Flyers, they came up a bit short in that regard. But, the defense was pretty solid in keeping it from being a disaster on the man advantage.

DENVER -- During the summer of 2002, Colorado state officials were dealing with the 138,000-acre Hayman Fire while trying to let potential tourists know the state was still open for business.

The stories told by the women reportedly changed, at first implicating multiple Packers and then just Underwood.|1
Can you put a price on faith? That is the question churchgoers are asking as the tradition of tithing -- giving 10% of your income to the church -- is increasingly challenged. Opponents of tithing say it is a misreading of the Bible, a practice created by man, not God. They say they should be free to donate whatever amount they choose, and they are arguing with pastors, writing letters and quitting congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teaching and rejected what has been a favored form of fund raising for decades.|1

The best element of M.

Guess what? The NBA really is a showbiz affair. Only super-producer David Stern isn’t pulling all the behind-the-curtain strings (otherwise, New York somehow would have won the draft lottery). To the contrary, the league lurches along in the manner of an over-budget, out-of-control Hollywood spectacular — propelled by the ego of big-money players, rife with jaw-dropping plot twists, subject to endless rewrites. And to think: We haven’t even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers. Regrettably, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball.|1
Multiple bills at the New Jersey statehouse are of interest to truckers and others using roadways throughout the state. Repeat drunk driving offenders could soon face harsher penalties for their actions. New Jersey law now limits punishment for affected offenders to a traffic offense. Bail typically is set at $2,500. The traffic offense designation allows drivers charged with drunken driving to continue to drive while awaiting their court date. Awaiting consideration on the Assembly floor is a bill to end that practice. Instead, A3057 would boost punishment for a person convicted of driving under the influence two times or more within 60 days to a fourth-degree crime.|1

First, we looked at which major brands cost the most to maintain over the first 10 years of a brand's existence. For those who have not heard about it, the Internet is a giant data center. That may seem like an odd thing to say about something that you're using for things such as email and instant messaging (MMS). However, what you may not realize is that internet data centers actually store millions of gigabytes of information every second. And that amount of storage space can add up pretty quickly.|0

Brazil is currently implementing the Brasil Sem Miséria programme — a continuation of the successful Fome Zero— which aims to do just that, Marques Porto says. Initiated in 2003 by former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Fome Zero is credited with having taken 30 to 40 million Brazilians out of poverty. One of the core actions of the programme was providing poor children with free school lunches, which were purchased by the state from family farms. In this way, support to local small farmers was provided at the same time as offering quality nutrition to children from low-income families.|1

Want to end the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the act has metastasized into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has done much to shape the freedom of political debate in the modern U.S. What began as a vague statute that gave President Woodrow Wilson power to jail critics and censor the news media during World War I has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by policing secrets, not speech. Censorship did not end when the war did. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute.|1

A few months later, in March 2007, we received our invitation to participate on the expedition at the North Shore. I remember it well because we got there about a month before the scheduled end date.

Study suggests complex behaviors were handed down for tens of thousands of years. Despite intense scientific inquiry, there is still no clear biological basis for what we think of as common sense moral behavior. A new study by researchers from California State University, Northridge and the University of Edinburgh provides an intriguing hypothesis about how this behavior evolved—but it has not been tested in any studies to date. In particular, the authors suggest that humans are hard-wired to care for those closest to them, and they offer a compelling reason to give children more attention and time around parents.|0

Did Donald Trump Release Donald Trump’s Tax Return? For a moment, it seemed that Rachel Maddow was in possession of a genuine scoop. And then, all of a sudden, it didn’t….Thanks to MSNBC, the suggestion that Trump has “paid no taxes in 18 years” has now been definitively proven to be false. Moreover, Trump seems to have paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than did most political figures, and to have enjoyed a sizeable income to boot. Whether the report was cherry-picked we cannot possibly know.|1
"( Host ) Two groups involved with mental health care want to know which Vermont doctors got thousands of dollars in payments from the state-run mental health system over four years, and if they should be banned from doing it. They also want to know if the payments violate a state ethics rule that says ""any member who receives or may receive reimbursement for services received from [a mental health program]…shall avoid any action inconsistent with ethical standards.""

The Hashemite Library remained a beacon of knowledge and a destination for readers and intellectuals until 2000, when the number of readers started to dwindle, given the tough economic situation in the Strip. In the 1950s, the Hashemite Library was commissioned to sell newspapers and books from prominent Egyptian publishing and distribution houses.

However, the Internet’s invasion and the poverty of Gaza Strip’s inhabitants have inhibited these activities. “Due to the rise of the Internet and the economic stagnation, we no longer got books for distribution or sale.|1
WASHINGTON (CN) – Republicans heaped ridicule on Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood at a Wednesday hearing after LaHood suggested that bicycling and walking are just as good ways to get around as cars. To laughter, Republican House members suggested LaHood was taking drugs, dismissed the very idea of bike lanes and derided any change to a car-dependent society. “What job is going to be created by having a bike lane?” asked Ohio Republican Steven LaTourette.

And, as Johanna Dunaway, and some colleagues at Colorado State and Louisiana State universities, found out, that polarization happened during a period of steady decrease in the number of local newspapers and journalists across the country.|1

An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco today to block a California law requiring police to collect a DNA sample from anyone arrested on suspicion of a felony. The law is part of a 2004 voter initiative that gradually expanded the categories of people in the criminal justice system from whom DNA is collected with cheek swabs. The four plaintiffs are challenging a provision that went into effect in 2009 and requires the DNA sampling from all felony arrestees, regardless of whether they are ever charged or convicted of a crime.|1

To involve private sector in healthcare, what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to meet the demand for health care.

It was a situation which baffled many around the world, let alone the passengers on board the British Airways plane. Yesterday a British Airways passenger jet due to fly from London to Dusseldorf landed in Edinburgh by mistake after the incorrect flight plan was given to its pilots. The BA3271 flight was operated by German firm WDL Aviation - which was responsible for the aircraft and cabin crew - on behalf of BA as part of a leasing deal. It is understood one possibility is that on its final flight on Sunday, the plane had flown to Edinburgh and back and so the same flight plan was repeated again on Monday morning.|1
This past June, the Tacoma Rainiers brought reindeer mascot Rhubarb and local icon “Epic Sax Gorilla” up onto the roof of Cheney Stadium, where the Triple-A club plays, for a routine crowd-pleasing stunt.

"SANTA MARIA, Brazil – Penny-pinching by a band known for its onstage pyrotechnic displays may have cost more than $200 million to stage the biggest electronic music festival in history this year at Rio de Janeiro's iconic Maracana stadium, sources confirmed to E!

That price tag is almost double the $88 million the organizers reported last week when they unveiled the final lineup of artists scheduled to play the four-day concert that kicks off Saturday.

The New York Knicks approach the quarter-mark of the schedule with a middling 9-9 record as they aim to end their 43-year championship drought. Coach Jeff Hornacek and the Knicks will have the upper hand against opponents in December. In the 15 games they will play this month, only five of those will be against teams with winning records. They’ll host the 5-13 Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday. Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose and Carmelo Anthony are arguably the biggest names on the roster, but they are not playing up to expectations. Anthony’s team-leading 22.2-point scoring average is up slightly from last season.|1
I have just been reminded of why I quit financial journalism after 11 years in the saddle, including a year as editor-in-chief, when I got to the end of my second term on Friday and realized what we've had to endure for much of our lives: The money doesn't seem real. There seems to be no end in sight. It's all a mirage. The United Kingdom will vote on whether to remain in the European Union on Thursday (18 March).

In the third quarter of 2018, luxury home prices increased 3.2% year over year to an average of $1.7 million, according to the latest data from Redfin. Redfin classifies luxury homes as those that sold among the top 5% most expensive in the quarter. According to the company, sales of homes priced at or above $2 million increased for the ninth consecutive quarter. However, this is the smallest rate of growth since early 2016.

Forget announcing your latest album with a gigantic, budget-crippling open-air concert - Oasis have been hiring street musicians to fill their arenas for years. The band spent $100,000 building an entire stage for their 2006 gig in Los Angeles - and now there's footage to prove it! As the debate over whether to repeal Obamacare continues to rage, one of the best ways to make sure Congress doesn't go off the cliff would be to change the way the president negotiates his deals. We already know that some Republicans want to do away with the Iran nuclear deal.|0
My daughter, a resident advisor at her college, recently groaned while mentioning that she’d likely get additional foreign exchange students to supervise this fall. When I asked why that’s a bad thing, she said the foreign exchange kids tend to presume Americans are stupid unless proven otherwise. They assume Americans aren’t as well-traveled, or as fluent in foreign languages or as knowledgeable about world cultures. I said what any Good American would: Why don’t they stay home, then? Oh, she replied, they don’t think our colleges are stupid.|1

The PA needs $116 million to cover the monthly payroll.

MELBOURNE, Australia - Defending champion Victoria Azarenka struggled to hold off injured American Jamie Hampton 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 on Saturday before advancing to the fourth round of the Australian Open. Hampton, who needed a medical timeout for a lower back problem before she served out the second set and winced in pain, frequently on the verge of tears, throughout the third, still managed to hit 41 winners to keep the top-ranked Azarenka under pressure. Azarenka appeared frustrated at times, but overcame an early break and fended off triple break point in the seventh game of the deciding set before clinching the match in 2 hours, 9 minutes.|1

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but also for that reason, an extraordinary case study for evaluating the mandate that should determine the relationship between the National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation. Ideally speaking, the national security set up anchored on Intelligence, exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security –external or internal –with the aim of neutralising it in time. At the same time, however, it does this on the authority of the elected Political Executive that is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy.|1

It was a Saturday morning. August. I remember it vividly. I was online, sat up in front of my computer, scrolling through Google News. There was an article with the title 'Kellogg Co. to release cereal based on popular children's characters' and all I could see was the headline, 'Kellogg will create Kellogg's Corn-O-Chew cereal based on Peanuts.' I didn't have much of a clue as to what it was about or who would be involved in this new venture. What I did know was that it sounded like a fun project for me, but not a job.|0

Montana, Exxon-Mobil At Odds Over Oil Spill Montana and oil giant Exxon-Mobil are at odds over an oil spill in the state's Yellowstone River. Exxon-Mobil says it's doing all it can to clean up the spill and has promised to see the cleanup through. That's not enough for Montana's state officials — particularly its governor. They say that the company hasn't been forthright on the extent of the spill and that they're not doing enough. Michele Norris speaks with Montana Gov.

Mickey Boodaei has been a leading entrepreneur in the security space for years. He co-founded Imperva, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2011, and he co-founded Trusteer, which was sold to IBM for $1 billion in 2013. Soon after the latter acquisition, he founded Transmit Security. Interestingly, Boodaei did so without seeking venture capital. He indicated that by putting his own money (and that of co-founder Rakesh Loonkar) into the start-up, it felt more like when he founded his first firms, but in this case, there was no one else to answer to.|1

At her weekly therapy sessions, Julie revealed her most uncomfortable secrets: depression, debt, childhood sexual abuse. Her psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital would then type a summary into Julie’s computerized medical record. With that, more than 200 pages of sensitive notes became available to any doctor who cared for her within the sprawling Partners HealthCare system. She discovered this only when one doctor later referenced the notes. Julie, a 43-year-old lawyer, was unnerved, then angry. “The details are really nobody’s business,” she said.

Where were you when you received your 40 Under 40 award? It was 2009 and I was in my first year of medical school.

Why’s an incendiary Dutch journalist on the payroll of the ex-Alaska governor’s political action committee? A Mother Jones investigation.

Addresses linked to the firm lead to mail drops. It has no website. No phone number. Not even the California lawyer who incorporated the company knew who was behind it.

The Bible teaches, “Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are led by various lusts (see 1 Tim.3:5-6). Many great people in God have fallen into fleshly temptations and potentially ruined their lives and ministries. One person has said, “It takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it.” This is a true saying! I believe one of the most important reasons leaders fall is that most have never intentionally set up mental and emotional firewalls.|1

"Trisha Pollard believes the Texas social services system relies too much on the courts to police Medicaid fraud and not enough on a tool placed in its hands nearly nine years ago: criminal background checks.

According to analysts, the market is entering a consolidation phase after the recent run-up. NEW DELHI: A below-normal monsoon forecast by private weather agency Skymet proved to be a big dampener for stock benchmarks on Wednesday, which surrendered the day's gains after scaling all-time highs. According to Skymet, monsoon in 2019 is likely to be ‘below normal’ to the tune of 93 per cent of the long period average (LPA) of 887 mm for four months starting from June to September. This sent the bulls hurtling downwards, wiping off the earlier gains, as the market ended in negative territory.|1

Part two of Naomi Klein's report on the events that triggered a momentous new kind of politics in Argentina. Up until quite recently, Argentina pursued a policy of official amnesia when it came to the crimes of the Dirty War. Sure, the human rights non-governmental organisations still issued numerous scathing reports, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo still marched and the children of disappeared parents still showed up, from time to time, outside the homes of ex-military figures to throw red paint. But before the Argentinazo, most middle-class Argentinians regarded such actions as macabre rituals from a bygone era.|1

Nobody asked me, but … if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization, subscribe to racist publications, buy tickets to a Holocaust denial conference and have a Holocaust denial DVD in your video collection, then you're probably a neo-Nazi. That does not mean you are once and for all a neo-Nazi. You can have a change of heart and a change of mind, and come clean. If you want people to believe you are no longer a neo-Nazi, you have a lot of convincing to do. It takes a lot of work to shake the brown shirt.|1

Indeed, by Sunday, temperatures are expected to be back in the 50s, and then possibly into the 60s, for a few days. Highs should still be near or just shy of 100.

Northern Ireland was today branded the race hate capital of Europe, in a report on racist violence in the country. The first time we saw her it seemed like she was all smiles and good spirits as she rode her white horse up through the streets of St Stephen's Green. But the smile vanished into a grimace as she stood in front of the media yesterday, with a black eye and bruised hand, looking down at her arm. She'd broken her leg earlier that day and spent the entire week undergoing rehabilitation. When she was ready to come back she did.|0

Anyone who’s ever been frustrated at the task of shooting video in low light should be poised to freak out over Canon’s weird and amazing new camera. It’s a video camera that shoots full HD color footage in almost complete darkness. The ‘multi-purpose’ camera, dubbed only MH20F-SH, has a full-frame sensor with 2.26 megapixels. The reason for the meager resolution is because each pixel is very large—19 microns to be exact. That’s 7.5x larger than, say, the pixels found on a flagship DSLR like the Canon 1Dx.|1

In 1980, a group of non-commissioned officers (NCOs) overthrew the elected government despite intense resistance from a badly outgunned police force, which was only subdued when the navy shelled them into submission.

It happens : You hit the snooze button once, twice, then three times, so when you're ready, it's over. At first it was just annoying, but as time went on I felt bad about it, and I realised that if someone had hit me once I would probably stop for a few hours to recover before trying to sleep.

The foremost name among all such group is that of Bajrang Dal whose activist burnt alive, an Australian missionary, at the gates of a prayer meeting room of the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata, on February 19th. The man was later arrested and tried for murder but the prosecution could not prove the allegation beyond reasonable doubt as it was unable to show that he had intended to kill the missionary or that his motive was any political one. It must be conceded that the case is unfortunate for the innocent people who are being accused by this extremist group.|0

The response to the bombs by the crowd at the finish line was, I think, exemplary. Sure there were plenty of arrests, and it was chaotic.

Could drain tubes solve Compact conflict? How do we get more water into the Republican River? Could it be as simple as redesigning existing pasture dams to have drain down tubes installed?

Note: This solution does not remove any of the pasture dams, as they provide a valuable service for us, it only redesigns them. The tubes can be set an elevation that allows water to remain for livestock, wildlife, its.|1
Study suggests complex behaviors were handed down for tens of thousands of years. Despite intense scientific inquiry, there are still major gaps in our knowledge about early human life. One major question that remains unanswered: when humans were first capable of complex cognition? In other words, when did early humans develop sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as prioritization and cultural transmission, that we would recognize today? A new study in Nature addresses this; after six years of excavation, archaeologists have unearthed technologically-advanced stone tools that were created about 71,000 years ago.|1

January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are making progress is because factions with responsibilities for large chunks of the population are willing to compromise if that will help stem the accelerating decline in living standards nationwide. Economic activity is shrinking and shortages increasing because of the factional fighting and especially because two governments claim to rule the entire country. Then there is all the Islamic terrorist violence. While most Libyans appreciate the help from Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Kaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become more of a menace than the Kaddafi era secret police ever were.|1

Girls Like Biology, Boys Like Physics? We all have our stereotypes about which subjects appeal more to girls and which boys seem more comfortable with. Perhaps this is due in no small part to media stereotypes of women who are overly focused on being pretty, while men gravitate toward science and engineering because they are interesting and practical. For many boys (and girls), however, biology is often portrayed as a boy thing that can't be appreciated by them. This may not be true for everyone, but it certainly is the case for some younger boys and girls.|0

New Zealand’s Abortion Supervisory Committee is appealing a High Court judge’s decision that said there is reason to doubt the legality of many abortions in the country. A registered practitioner may legally perform an abortion in New Zealand only if acting under a certificate approved by two consultants, who are appointed by the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The appeal also argues that the Court made a legal error in concluding that the committee can form its own opinion about the lawfulness of consultants’ decisions to grant or to refuse approval for an abortion.|1

If you think Malawi is living the past where your police lied to the country that Robert Chasowa committed suicide when in true sense your party killed him, you are mistakenly wrong. Malawi of today is not ready to tolerate nonsense. Few weeks ago when your party terrorized the nation your president Peter Mutharika failed to utter any word. Upon growing pressure the president instructed Mgeme Kalirani to craft a statement that did not address what the nation expected. Till now your government has not announced the identity of the terrorists or apprehend them.|1

Rep. Francis D. Gibson speaks on the Utah Inland Port Authority Bill that he sponsored as Utah Legislators gather at the Capitol in Salt Lake City, Friday, March 3, 2017. I've been doing my best to stay out of politics lately. There have been a couple things that have brought up thoughts of leaving the Republican Party. They started after the first debate, and continued during the rest of the election cycle. The one thing that has caused me to think about this more seriously is the fact that many people are now blaming President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for what happened to Donald Trump.|0
The images we have published out of Yemen may be as unsettling as anything we have used before. Here’s why we made the decision to publish them. Amal Hussain is a 7-year-old Yemeni girl with a haunting gaze whose image sits atop our latest report from Yemen, a country plunged into war and on the brink of a catastrophic famine. Amal is skin and bones, and her head is turned away, as if she cannot bear to meet the eyes of those looking at her. Some readers may feel they want to look away, too.|1
It might not be the household name that devices like the Roku, Chromecast, or Fire TV are, but it is among one of the most popular streaming devices in the world and, according to new data, its popularity has only grown over time. The research firm GfK (formerly Nielsen) found that the average American household now holds a Roku 3 at least twice as frequently as they did just a year ago. The latest figures also reveal that Amazon's Fire TV was the fastest growing streaming device last year, outpacing the Samsung Smart TV and Sony Bravia TV.|0
The response to the bombs by the crowd at the finish line was, I think, exemplary. Sure, many people fled from the explosions, and reasonably so. But a remarkable number ran, as they say, to the sound of the guns, even though when two bombs go off, one might well expect more. Many of these were professionals. The finish line of a marathon is a fortuitous spot to bomb, in that doctors, policemen, ambulances and so on are stationed there. Some soldiers happened to be on hand. But others were not professionals.|1
"WASHINGTON -- An Iowa egg producer at the center of a nationwide outbreak of salmonella apologized to a Congressional panel on Wednesday and admitted that his family operation ""got big quite a while before we stopped acting like we were small."" ""What I mean by that is we were big before we started adopting sophisticated procedures to be sure we met all of the government requirements,"" the egg producer, Austin J. DeCoster, said in testimony before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. He is the founder of an egg empire that has been linked over three decades to multiple deadly outbreaks of salmonella poisoning in many states."|1
U.S. government debt yields rose on Friday after the U.S. government said that job creation was stronger than expected in March, but wages grew at a sluggish pace. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.538%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 2.947%. Bond yields move inversely to prices. Job creation snapped higher in March after an anemic February print, with nonfarm payrolls expanding by 196,000, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report released Friday.

BATON ROUGE, LA ( WAFB ) - Golfers in Baton Rouge could have fewer places to tee off after the city's golf course board said it plans to close three holes next month as part of a $25 million renovation project.

The lead seal is the first found bearing the image of St. Sabas, local big shot 1,500 years ago. A rare seal from the Crusader era has been found in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Kiryat Yovel. The lead seal, which dates to some 800 years ago, bears the likeness of St. Sabas, one of the most important people active in Jerusalem during the Byzantine period, some 1,500 years ago. Despite the importance of St. Sabas — whose Syriac name is Mar Saba — to Christian history in Israel, no seals with his image had been found before.|1

The fourth episode of Aaron Sorkin’s The Newsroom is called “I’ll Try to Fix You.” That may as well be the title of the whole series. Like Sorkin’s The West Wing, the show wants to fix America, this time through the story of Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels), a successful, cynical and bland cable-news anchor who decides that he, and journalism, and yea, democracy, can do better.

Without much fuss or fanfare, but, happily, with plenty of shoppers, Salisbury quietly reopened its central shopping centre on Saturday, almost three months after it became the site of an international incident. The Maltings, which connects the coach park to the city centre, has been off-limits to the public and shielded by safety cordons and tents since the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on one of its park benches after being poisoned. Market traders were moved behind the shopping precinct by Wiltshire county council while the decontamination operation was under way.|1
VIDEO: On March 30, 2017, Atlanta drivers on I-85 north found themselves in a stunning situation when materials stored beneath the interstate overpass spanning Piedmont Road and Monroe Drive caught fire. The overpass then collapsed. Despite the 2017 I-85 bridge collapse that threw Atlanta into a two-month traffic nightmare — or the massive sinkholes that have erupted around town — Georgia infrastructure is actually among the very best in the nation. That’s according to researchers over at 24/7 Wall Street, who created an index using the share of potentially hazardous bridges, roads or dams to identify which states fare worst of all when it comes to infrastructure.|1
"Bob Cannard shovels compost which orignally came from San Francisco food scraps at Green String Farms outside Petaluma, Calif., on Friday, Mar. 6, 2009.

The premise that parents can ""easily forget that their children are in the backseat"" is, sadly, all too true."|1

The first time I heard these verses was in a small storefront church in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember because it was the same Sunday morning that Princess Diana’s tragic death was reported. I had recently left my job on Wall Street and was living in Kiev with my mother after my father had passed away and I was there because I was not having much luck in finding my way forward. I recall the wood-paneled walls of the room where I sat in the back, slightly embarrassed by the evangelical enthusiasm of my fellow expats. But when I heard these verses my wandering mind was drawn back.|1

The lead seal is the first found bearing the image of St. Sabas, local big shot 1,500 years ago. One thing that I was always curious to find out was why people do things. As soon as you get older and have a little bit more time to think about things, it just seems logical that one of the biggest mysteries in our world is why humans do what they do. It makes perfect sense to ask yourself why are you here? Who are you? Why do you exist in this universe? Do you have anything to do with anything?|0
RICH KARLGAARD: You should look at 4 areas. One is financial regulations, which still makes it hard for small business to get loans. You have the health care regulations that you mentioned, Obamacare is adding cost burdens everywhere you look, behind every nook and cranny.

California farmers are getting rooned at the expense of the protection of certain insects. Then you have labor regulations. Last year we saw the national labor relations board war against Boeing.|1

Dublin: Lawmakers overwhelmingly voted on Friday to back Ireland's first bill on abortion, legalising the practice in exceptional cases where doctors deem the woman's life at risk from her pregnancy, as the predominantly Catholic country took its first legislative step away from an outright ban. Exhausted legislators applauded Friday's 127-31 vote, while outside the parliament gates abortion rights activists cheered as they watched the result on their smartphones. It capped a grueling debate that locked lawmakers in argument from Wednesday morning to 5am Thursday and, after a pause for sleep, through midnight Friday.|1
I strongly encourage the Mayor and Council to move forward to preserve South Central Corridor.

The carrier operates 744 mainline planes that vary in size, carrying 50 to 366 passengers each. For a typical 737 plane carrying 179 passengers, the reduction would mean about 11 pounds per flight. Per the paper, stopping on-board sales of duty-free items like “perfumes, chocolates and liquor” also saved 1.4 millions of gallons of fuel annually, saving United Airlines $2.3 million. Presumably that also means United was making less than $2.3 million selling the items in-flight or calculated that allowing passengers to pick them up at ground level would not dent its revenue significantly.|1

I understand why you might want a smart thermostat, such as Nest, however overpriced it may be."|1

"As a veteran of the movement to combat climate change, I have been conditioned to expect disappointment.

The Internet has changed beyond anything could have foreseen just five years ago. It is no longer a browsing medium: it is full of Web 2.0 applications, real time communications challenges and a whole range of threats that are designed to piggy back on this new usage.

This Webinar will explain how Internet usage has changed and how your perception of IT may not match what your users are actually doing, resulting in your security controls being by-passed.|1

With the economy beginning to stall, Ben Bernanke's war on the nation's savers rolls on. A few of these funds even pay juicy double-digit yields — like the one my Permanent Wealth Investor subscribers have earned 20% on in two years. Dividend harvest funds: These funds buy shares in companies that are about to pay a dividend, and then sell the stock after the dividend is paid. By doing this, they can rotate through companies with different payment dates, and thereby achieve a high dividend payout. The problem is that shares generally trade lower after a dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend.|1

The best element of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film, Split - and one of the few things it did right - happened at the very end.

Let's stop trying to put a label on them and just be happy! OK, I'm just saying. I don 't want anyone to have to feel bad for me or my sister-in-law.

He can begin talking to potential new clubs in January.|1
BASEL, Switzerland – Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG said Monday that it has had reports of 13 cases the H1N1 flu becoming resistant to Tamiflu, which it calls a very low percentage. A good sign is that the people who had the resistant strain have not passed the disease on to other people, said David Reddy, leader of Roche&apos;s Tamiflu pandemic task force. And the resistant variety has been like the widespread version of the virus in that it typically produces only mild symptoms. The 13 cases were scattered around the world in Europe, the United States and Asia, said Reddy.|1

Without a doubt, the addiction drama “ Beautiful Boy ” – not the slasher-flick “ Halloween ” – is the most anticipated movie of the spring season. The first thing I noticed about the movie is that it is completely different from any other thriller I have seen, or even thought about. It was raining for three hours and then it started to dry up. But there was one thing standing between the family and getting their beloved cat back: the law. It didn't matter where the cat lived or what had happened to its owner; the law was at work.|0
The annual meeting of the Kelly Gang is normally a festive affair. The get-together, the brainchild of New York Post media columnist Keith J. Kelly, has been held on St. Patrick’s Day for the past three years at Langan’s pub, on 47th Street. The guests: media types and others celebrating their shared surname Kelly and their innate Irishness—over corned beef and cabbage and a pint or three of Guinness. But the mood changed when police commissioner Raymond Kelly arrived. Wearing a green tie, he tried to keep things light: “Kellys are fun people,” he declared.|1

To involve private sector in healthcare, what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to reach out to more people. The nation has a new health policy after 14 years. The long gap itself indicates the priority, or the lack thereof, accorded to a sector that is in need of some urgent attention and has deep linkages with the nation’s aspiration to grow faster and emerge as a strong economy in the global order. The new policy has proposed seven key shifts in organising healthcare services, among them a welcome change in primary care from selective to assured comprehensive care with linkages to referral hospitals.|1
"The main task of North Korea's junior minister for re-information is to refute everything ever said by French intellectuals. One year he did a special on Jean-Paul Sartre and began with Sartre's assertion that ""Three o'clock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do"". As it was a drowsy Friday afternoon, the junior minister simply made a quick call and renamed his local football team 4.25 Sports Club. This made Sartre look very silly indeed, because the club play all their matches at 4.25pm. In fact every time they play, their fans chant ""Are you watching, Jean-Paul Sartre?"""|1

KENTON, Del. - A Kenton cheese plant shut down by the Food and Drug Administration due to a mold problem could reopen next month after an inspection. State inspectors determined at a Nov. 5 inspection that a small amount of mold in the cheese processing area on the company's main floor was causing contamination.

By detaining Haniyeh, Israel sent a message that Palestinian cash smuggling is coming to an end. It is an open secret that Hamas has been smuggling millions of dollars into Gaza through the Rafah crossing ever since the international community cut financial aid to the Palestinian Authority following Hamas's rise to power earlier this year. Yet Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's decision on Thursday to close the Rafah crossing to keep PA Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh from bringing $35 million into Gaza was the first time Israel has actively intervened to stop the money flow.|1

The spat between the Intelligence agencies of the US and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only bizarre but has also exposed how much we still lack.

And on the other hand they have faced constant political interference in their efforts to carry out their duties.

Less than two years ago, I was seated at a South Atlantic League baseball game (low A ball) between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers — Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were charting the game. As I discussed in this post, neither pitcher seemed destined to make the major leagues. Richards had been undrafted in 2015 coming out of a small college, and thus had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016 and he was pitching well for Greensboro.|1
If the U.S. presidential election were resolved on social media, Barack Obama would be the clear winner this year over Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The Obama campaign has embraced social media, with the president holding a huge lead in Facebook and Twitter followers, and the affiliated Democratic National Committee is using private social networking tools to communicate with some campaign operatives. There's also evidence that the Obama campaign has tapped into social media analytics to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of the campaign's messages. Neither campaign, contacted to discuss their social media strategies, returned messages.|1
