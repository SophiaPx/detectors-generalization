Sanday , a Scottish island inhabited by only six people , has just got its first road – an unpaved track which will eventually be connected to a national highway. The road project, part of a wider initiative by the island’s government to improve transport services , will not only allow more residents to access the local shops, it will also improve access to tourist attractions such as Loch Ness . But the plan is also controversial, provoking opposition from some residents, some of whom have taken to the streets in protest.|0

If you ca n't find figs , layer the cream and the crunch here onto whichever fruits are in season. I used peaches. It's all about the fresh fruit. Don't go by the box if you can't find figs , just make the layers thinner until you get to the ones you want. The figs look beautiful. It's hard to believe I have had them all summer long. My son had a wonderful summer at camp. We camped together for several weeks. The weather was beautiful, but by the third week the wind was howling and blowing sand around in every direction.|0

"Student Senators passed a resolution that would have NYU divest from three companies associated with the Israeli government and institute boycotts on companies doing business with Israeli governments. The resolution, passed by a 2-1 majority, stated, ""In light of the Israeli government's support for and participation in the Occupation, we believe that there is no way that the University should invest money in a company that does business with Israeli institutions or companies or with companies that profit from the Israeli occupation.”



The motion to divest was backed by the Student Senate's Executive Board. It passed unanimously, with a 2-1 majority."|0

BOB Cole died yesterday. Around 2pm in a purpose-built flat on a Swiss industrial estate outside Zurich, he said goodbye to his friends, and went to sleep for the last time. He was 68, terminally ill, and was taking his life into his own hands, as around 30 Britons do each year at the Dignitas. His wife, Pam, was one of them. She was suffering from progressive supernuclear palsy, a fatal brain disease, and faced a terrible death. In February last year she died as Chris de Burgh’s Here is Your Paradise played at her bedside.|1
Two capitals are look set to burst through the 40C mark and another swelters through its 10th day of a heatwave that has left more than 20 people in hospital. While it’s hot and dry in Spain, the heatwave in Greece has been blamed on the country’s poor air quality – the worst in the world. The mercury is rising at an average of 13C, and the temperature at night is a sultry 20C – with a predicted maximum of 28C. At least 19 people have been hospitalised across Spain.|0
The British are known for their collective stiff upper lip . The elements of British style translate easily in every corner of the world and it is not only in Great Britain that British fashion is respected. This is not to say the British are all fashion snobs, far from it. It is the British that know how to dress themselves in an appropriate way and still be comfortable in the knowledge that they look stylish. This approach has seen them becoming a popular style ambassador for many countries. It has also allowed them the opportunity to become known for their versatility and style.|0
"This week, in a closed-door meeting of Congressional Democrats with President Obama, Representative Ed Perlmutter of Colorado bluntly said what has been on many politicians' minds: ""Larry Summers. Bad choice."" Mr. Obama was visibly annoyed and mounted a defense of Mr. Summers, his former economic policy adviser who also served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Summers, who the president said had become something of a ""progressive whipping boy,"" appears to be a strong contender to succeed Ben S. Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve."|1
"The Nicholls softball team staged a strong defensive effort Wednesday night against Southern Mississippi in its home opener at Swanner Field in Thibodaux. Nicholls State stifled the Golden Eagles at the plate, while taking advantage of three errors in the 4-1 non-conference victory. Colonels pitcher Megan Landry earned the win with four strikeouts, a walk and by scattering three hits in six innings. Southern Miss pitcher Abby Trahan took the loss despite six strikeouts, two walks and allowing five hits. ""It was a bit of a chess match in the beginning,"" Colonels coach Angel Santiago said."|1
In a study from 24/7 Wall Street, Leelanau County was named Michigan's most expensive housing market with a median home price of $281,979. To find Michigan's most expensive housing market, you'll need to look to Michigan's northern Lower Peninsula — and the home of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Leelanau County is home to 26 wineries, the coastal village of Suttons Bay and a substantial portion of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. The picturesque M-22 also runs along the peninsula's shoreline. The median mortgage payment in Leelanau County is $1,140 with a median household income of $59,018.|1
Planting the Savannah grasses in front of Cary Home seemed like a good idea in 2013 , when they received $5 million from the government to get the work started. “If we get it done right, that’s when we can start to tell people what they need to do to get the best quality of life out here,” he said. They are now at the final stretch, and they are hoping they can finish in the spring. The project is estimated to cost $5 million to $6 million.|0
In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don’t report to presidents. In Russia, things are different. Most of those businesses are majority-state-owned corporations, virtual branches of the government. And that means when you talk to the head of a Russian bank or oil company, you are effectively talking to the Kremlin. In 2000, when Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency, he consolidated competing power centers — media, business, local government, opposition parties and the Parliament — under his authority. He called it “a vertical of power.” This system now includes organized crime and cybercriminals.|1
While the SP-BSP-RLD alliance may disrupt the caste math in many pockets, the Congress is relegated to the role of a vote-splitter. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s popularity is still high in western UP but will that be adequate to repeat a 2014-like sweep? As eight constituencies go to polls on Thursday, ET takes a closer look into what’s turning into a seat-to-seat battle. While the SP-BSP-RLD alliance may disrupt the caste math in many pockets, the Congress is relegated to the role of a vote-splitter.

Chrissy Teigen and John Legend arrive at the Oscars on Feb. 26, 2017 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Chrissy Teigen is loving life on vacation and, judging by a new post, her hubby John Legend isn’t the only singer in the house. Teigen, the model and activist, shared a video of herself goofing around with an inflatable flamingo by a pool and singing “Thank You For Being A Friend,” the theme for The Golden Girls, a hugely popular sitcom in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Harvest season is back, which means it’s time to drive out to the farm stands on the East End of Long Island, but which ones are worth the trip is the question.

Considering all the comings and goings of people involved in the project, we should be grateful that Bohemian Rhapsody has finally landed on the big screen. Changing directors and lead actors puts a seed of doubt in minds as to how successful a film is likely to be. However, it’s a worthy biopic of Freddie Mercury, and Queen. There’s no argument that Rami Malek is great as the famed lead singer, but Ben Hardy (Roger Taylor), Gwilym Lee (Brian May) and Joseph Mazzello (John Deacon) also look and sound the part.|1
The new law finishes old business in Trenton and expands the so-called Tuition Equality Act, which let qualified immigrants pay in-state tuition. Going to college is not cheap these days. In fact, for many in New Jersey, it is unaffordable. Gov. Phil Murphy’s signing into law a bill that allows undocumented immigrants to apply for state financial aid to help pay for college beginning this fall won’t help all who hope to attend a post-secondary school, but it could help many. With Murphy’s signing, New Jersey becomes the 10th state to extend financial aid to undocumented college students.|1
Beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl is never easy. When they scored 21 points the first three times they held the ball in the second half and took a 33-32 lead, we all thought the same scary movie we’ve seen since 2001 was replaying before our eyes. But this epic brought a different ending. This one saw Foles, a man of faith who wants to be a pastor when he leaves the game, play as if touched by God. He completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.|1
"Former police officer Drew Peterson threw his wife to the floor one night, grabbed her throat and told her he ""could kill her there and then,"" a one-time co-worker of the wife testified Tuesday at a hearing to determine what evidence can be admitted in Peterson's murder trial.

I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad ’ s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should have been allowed to pray at the British mosque. It was so long since the government had permitted Muslim worshippers to say ” Allah-u-Akbar” on British soil that she would have liked the day to have arrived when, as she told her fellow Muslims, “The Muslim faith has finally been allowed to grow freely in the British Isles.” When I wrote to Eureka about this issue, I suggested to the journalist who replied that there was nothing more important than allowing Muslim prayer services in the UK.|0
An SEO named William Stanley was sentenced to more than three years in prison and ordered to pay $ 174,888 in restitution.

The Texas Supreme Court has transferred about 80 cases from El Paso 's 8th Court of Appeals in a first step toward moving the state's high court back to the border region. The cases have been in state District Court in El Paso for the past decade or so. But last week, the Supreme Court rejected a request to transfer the cases, saying the El Paso appellate court should decide the cases in light of pending lawsuits from landowners. The move comes months after the state's high court announced plans to relocate the state's top court to the El Paso area.|0
New Jersey hits day three of its government shutdown Monday over a budget stalemate that's closed state parks — and will likely force the furlough of 35,000 workers. On Sunday, the impasse even inconvenienced Gov. Chris Christie, forcing him to leave a state beach that was on shutdown to the public — but open to his family — because he had to return to Trenton. All nonessential services remained closed as the Republican governor and the Democratic Assembly speaker continued to disagree over Christie's plan for a nonprofit health system that is at the center of the budget dispute.|1

"Bavarian farmers are angry that their famous Alpine dairy cows will apparently have to wear nappies under European Union environmental laws. Johann Huber, whose family has farmed on the mountain slopes of Gmund am Tegernsee for over 400 years, has begun putting home made nappies on his 18 diary cows to avoid falling foul of an EU fertiliser ban. Mr Huber said that his cow Doris had behaved well when he fitted her with a home made bovine nappy to prevent her dropping cow pats on the Alpine slopes. ""We have no standard nappies, they have not been developed commercially yet,"" he said."|1
To any objective observer , the consensus that exists between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the fundamental issues of national security is far different than the one that exists between any other two major party candidates at this time. The issue of national security is often cited as the defining issue in each presidential contest, and the Obama-Romney difference is perhaps the most fundamental disagreement between them on this issue, which is so central to any discussion of their candidacy. It is not surprising that the issue is at the center of their differences, nor is it surprising that both men have agreed on its importance to their own campaigns.|0
The husband of a woman suspected of cutting a fetus out of another woman told police he found the baby “gasping” in a bathroom at their home, shortly after the attack, according to court documents obtained by Reuters. David Ridley said he believed his wife, 34-year-old Dynel Catrece Lane, was really pregnant; and when he returned to their Longmont, Colorado, home on Wednesday.

It didn't have the highest success rate when it came to matches this season, with only Melissa Walsh and John Robertson still together. But the lack of relationships continuing after Married At First Sight hasn't deterred unlucky in love singles, with Channel Nine confirming they have received a record number of applications for next year's season. A network spokesperson told The Daily Telegraph they have received 10,000 applications since the casting call began earlier this month.

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India ( Irdai ) has proposed to ask some insurance companies to mandatorily offer life insurance coverage in rural and semi-urban India. The idea of mandatoriness is to spread the life insurance in villages and urban areas. In addition, it has proposed that these insurance companies be encouraged to offer non-life cover, such as fire and other types of protection to rural and urban households and employees. This comes at a time when India is fighting a cash crisis as a result of a shortage of the cash that people use to make purchases.|0

WASHINGTON – Congress is moving to put under military control all armed contractors operating in combat zones, a Pentagon recommendation that could run into resistance at the State Department. The Senate this month included such a requirement in its 2008 defense spending bill. Democratic Sen. Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Wednesday he is confident the House will go along with the idea and include it in a final bill sent to President George W. Bush. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was to testify about the subject Thursday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.|1

Let’s dispense with the question of whether Democrat Ralph Northam is being treated unfairly. His grievous political wounds — by Monday, virtually all Democratic Party luminaries in the state and most Democratic presidential hopefuls had called on him to resign — are self-inflicted. When the photograph from Northam’s Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook surfaced Friday, his first reaction was to issue a statement of abject apology. Tactically, in terms of crisis management, that was the right move — own the transgression and say unambiguously that you’re sorry.|1

"Before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married, the tabloids floated a strange rumour: the couple might elope. Would they run off to Jamaica? Hawaii? Toronto? Would they decamp to the Okavango Delta in Botswana, where the howls of exotic animals would greet a small gathering of family and friends as the young couple held hands before a vegan minister, swapping vows in the crackling glow of a union pyre as flames licked the sky and village elders blessed guests before the yoga-safari reception?

ARSENE WENGER last night confessed he passed up the chance to buy Didier Drogba – for just £100,000 !

"Mission of Burma: Signals, Calls, and Marches / Vs.
Thirty years later, Mission of Burma still sounds like the future. Mission of Burma is a band with a lot to offer acolytes of cool post-punk minimalism who prefer a little anthemic arena rock and musical invention with their explorations of modern sterility. The Boston trio of Roger Miller, Clint Conley, and Peter Prescott brought exuberance and lyricism to their noise rock, producing only one full-length studio album before disbanding in 1983. Producer Martin Swope added the tape effects that lend the band its dreamlike, blurred-around-the-edges sound."|1
It's not your imagination—but you should blame the candidates, not the media.

We need to deal with the business we have before us,” Bill Clinton told CNN in December. Of course, neither Clinton is a particularly reliable narrator here, because it’s the third member of the Clinton clan who is responsible for much of the ink that has been spilled about an election still more than two and a half years away.|1

"Pierre René-Worms , FRANCE 24 | Marco Cecchinato is the lowest-ranked French Open semi-finalist since 1999 . Marco Cecchinato , who has just turned 19 in February, is the youngest player to reach the semi-finals of the French Open , but he did so as the second-youngest man to ever do so behind Roger Federer. In other words, the youngster has to beat Roger Federer to truly make his mark, but that seems unlikely given the fact that Federer has won a Grand Slam this year and is only one Grand Slam off from winning another."|0

Who pulled the plug on the canal this time? It’s winter, and we’re certainly not in the middle of a drought, so what’s happened to this stretch of the Grand Union Canal? The Cooks Wharf area of the canal appears to have drained away again, just four months after the same section was left bereft of water. The area sits just outside Cheddington on the way to Marsworth. In August there was a similar scene after a boater left a lock gate paddle open – the gates control the flow of water in the lock.|1
With the economic noose poised to tighten around Iran over its suspect nuclear program, the Tehran regime is shaking a stick at Gulf nations. Tensions in the Persian Gulf and modest economic recovery in the United States could influence retail gasoline prices, analysts said. The International Energy Agency could respond to a major Middle East oil crisis but doesn't see any immediate need for action, the group's director said. Military officials in Tehran said the United States can not stop Iran from preventing oil from passing through the strategic Strait of Hormuz.|1

Two tech executives played the role of superhero Thursday morning when they thwarted a man 's alleged attempt to steal the company that makes Apple's FaceTime phone software. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook and the other executives in the meeting at Apple's headquarters didn't react to the man's actions when the man, a security guard, was attempting to pull a laptop off a table on which he had sat down.

How will fuel prices and driving in Europe be affected by Brexit ? Following the momentous decision taken today by the UK electorate to vote to leave the EU, fuel prices could rise as soon as May 2019. This would be a huge disruption for many Europeans who depend on regular trips abroad for business or holiday and who will also face a drop in holiday season prices. How should travel agents and their customers make plans for travel in the event of increased fuel prices ? Will they be able to afford fuel costs or will they be stuck with the same prices as before ?|0

Millions of refugees have fled their homes in war-torn Syria since 2011 . President Barack Obama previously planned to resettle 10,000 over the next year. But following the massive terror attacks in Paris over the weekend where at least 129 died, many governors and legislators — mostly Republicans — have called for Obama to rethink the resettlement strategy. Delaware is one of at least nine states to openly welcome the idea of refugees, despite an avalanche of largely Republican governors opposing. According to a count by Vox , 25 governors have said they would bar admission of Syrian refugees to their states and 15 governors said they still support resettlement in their states.|1

For decades, aid groups have assumed they know what's best for refugees and the poor; a growing body of evidence suggests they're wrong. Both academic research and practical experience, such as with the mass of Syrians fleeing civil war, shows that simply handing out traditional relief goods may not be the most effective way of helping the dispossessed. Aid agencies are tentatively also giving away cash and letting refugees decide for themselves what they need. While the results may be unexpected, the money is being wisely spent and rarely wasted - contrary to old prejudices among donors.|1

There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams's performances that could, roughly, be called his American and British sides. On the American side, there was the slushy tendency towards sentimentality, for which he became increasingly known, which, at its best, resulted in Dead Poets Society, The Birdcage and Mrs Doubtfire, and, at its worst, became Patch Adams and Old Dogs. Hollywood has long had a tendency to adopt the finest and most interesting comedians and then determinedly blunt the hard edges that make them interesting. Along with Richard Pryor, Williams was the most obvious example of that.|1

Perhaps the most ironic and scary part of the whole “Thank You” rally was the crowd’s silence when Trump mentioned that everyone should come together. The irony being that his campaign has been anything but unifying, which is why his supporters backed him. They’re tired of seeing this country’s demographics being changed, their white privilege being challenged. Unity and inclusion is far from what these people want — even after the election’s over. I left Cincinnati tired and disheveled, but perhaps mostly worried about our future.|1

According to the Wall Street Journal, the spying has been ongoing during President Barack Obama’s two terms and continued unabated even after Edward Snowden’s surveillance revelations in 2013.

The case concerned a man named Richard Jones who paid tax on the income he received from a business which was registered in the Cayman Islands. He was able to deduct £100,000 worth of this tax from his total tax liability because he claimed to be a British company. This ruling meant that a large number of UK businesses would no longer be able to claim a tax offset in this way for income paid to non-resident employees.|0
China began three days of national mourning for the victims of the May 12 earthquake , restricting access to entertainment and other public areas, and canceling flights and leaving a number of government buildings shuttered, according to media accounts. The scale of the tragedy is still being assessed, with initial estimates of 1.2 million people dead and 8.2 million injured. A number of buildings collapsed in the quake and ensuing fires, and many more were damaged. In a sign of the seriousness of the crisis, China's central bank announced a new policy of reserve lending to the financial system for the first time since 2002.|0
Weather Underground on the Weather Channel: Highly gender-normative interactions. The lady sits behind the bar when the men are talking. This week the Weather Channel, mainstay of bored insomniacs and families on vacation in Florida, debuted a new weekday prime-time live show about the weather. Problem is, the show, Weather Underground, is set in what appears to be a 40-year-old storm chaser’s parents’ basement and features highly gender-normative interactions between its slew of male meteorologists and its single female presenter, Sarah Dillingham. Dillingham is working on a master’s degree in atmospheric sciences and appears on-camera during every segment of the two-hour show.|1
"The newest entry to the robo-advisory service is TIAA . Part of the allure for firms is to appeal to those who want to get more out of the relationship, but don’t see a huge ROI or who would rather have a relationship with their adviser than have one with an account executive. How to use them

For many of them, they can use TIAA. For others, TIAA is for the best of reasons not to use a robo adviser and to stick to the relationship that the adviser established with you."|0
The word hero gets thrown around so much that its use has lost much of the intended impact. Indie filmmaker Denise Ohio restores a bit of the word’s luster with this surprisingly compelling portrait of Frank Minden. Who? An ordinary, hard-working man, a WWII vet and master diesel machinist, the 76-year-old Minden has never signed a multimillion-dollar contract with a sports franchise or refused an Oscar in honor of the worthy cause of the day. But in the short space of thirty minutes, Ohio illustrates what makes this St. Louis man so admired and respected by those around him.|1
The Giants have several holes to fill heading into the 2019 season, and own the No. 6 overall pick after finishing 5-11. Monday's College Football Playoff National Championship Game features several players on the Alabama Crimson Tide and Clemson Tigers who would be welcomed additions to a Giants team that finished six of the last seven seasons with a losing record. Potentially an elite pass-rusher at the NFL level, Ferrell is also a solid defender against the run, thanks to his an explosive first-step, which opposing offensive tackles have struggled with on the edge.|1
To any objective observer, the consensus that exists between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the fundamental issues of war and peace, Wall Street’s dominance of American life, and fiscal austerity, has been made crystal clear in the two “debates.” In the absence of effective popular resistance to the duopoly of money, the economic and social crisis fails to create a corresponding political crisis for the rulers. As a result, there is nothing important for them to debate. The two titans of America’s finance capitalist duopoly clashed – leaving behind a dull fart.|1
Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child ’ s play , thanks to MIT .

A syrah lover finds hope in the Northwest, but sticks to his guns about the failure of many to reach their potential. Several weeks back, I wrote a column about syrah, in which I asserted that this great if temperamental varietal has tremendous potential, but along its journey from grape to wine often gets lost, mugged or tired. You hope and hope and hope, too frequently arriving at disappointment. Syrah is like soccer: 90 loping minutes of play for a final score of 2-1. I love watching soccer, and I love following syrah.|1

When Pacers coach Frank Vogel announced he would sit all five starters for last night's game against the Bucks, it was like a thought experiment come to life. Can a good team's second unit beat the starters of a historically awful team? It was close, but...yes! The game was an exciting one, if only from a theoretical standpoint: You desperately wanted to see what would happen, but not necessarily actually watch it go down. Because this wasn't Copeland and Solomon Hill and C.J. Watson getting meaningful minutes in just any late-season game—this game mattered.|1
"Marine Le Pen, the French National Front political party leader, at an FN political rally in Frejus. French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen is not the biggest fan of the euro.

Yes, this was a game the Yankees needed to win, and they did it with style and class. They beat the Angels for the first time since April 21, 2008 at the hands of the New York Yankees.

German scientists working on the Wendelstein 7-X fusion device started a series of experiments that could eventually prove the superiority of their project. When the German scientists started a new experiment that aimed to prove the superiority of their fusion-focussed reactor project at the Wendelstein7-X nuclear power plant near Kassel, they set up their experiments with the intention of seeing how the reactor behaved when it was fuelled by a neutron-star nuclear reactor. The W7-X reactor was designed and constructed in the 1970s, and it’s the second largest fusion reactor in the world, the Wendelstein 7-X being the biggest after the General Fusion Facility in Australia.|0

Will an upcoming vote in Congress signal the end of Medicare ? In the next few weeks Congress will decide whether to let Medicare continue in the present form. If we have learned anything, it is that the status quo is never permanent, at least not for the same reasons it was never permanent to begin with. The United States is currently in a period of political and fiscal upheaval, the result of which will have significant impact on the future structure and delivery of Medicare and related health care. If you’d like to see how this might impact you, here are the following scenarios.|0

Apologies, then, to the many books and writers — some of them featured in these very pages over the past year — who don’t appear below.|1

Cryptocurrencies, outside of Bitcoin, have failed to garner much attention from buyers, and while the same can be said of sellers, the digestion of losses over the past month is likely to lead to more losses soon. Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin are all carving out a similar bear-flag pattern that should lead to another purge of speculative excesses. Weak price action in ETH/USD has it set up to make another leg lower soon. It could continue to drift ever-so-slightly higher, but the developing bear-flag implies risk is skewed more heavily towards the downside.|1
The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has proposed to ask some insurance companies to mandatorily list on exchanges based on the number of years they have been in business. In a discussion paper on listing of Indian insurance firms, Irdai said it would direct general insurers (including health and reinsurers) to take steps to get listed after they complete eight years of operations. This will also apply to all life insurers that have completed 10 years. Irdai said firms that have already exceeded these criteria must list within three years from the date when the guidelines are issued.|1

With the lessons of 2014 fresh in their collective memory and the 2016 election cycle about to start, progressive groups and Democrats have been making a sustained push to highlight policies to boost incomes for the poor and middle class and fight income inequality. The Democrats on the House Budget Committee outlined a plan in January to create a $1,000 tax credit for every worker making less than $100,000 annually, financed by eliminating some tax exemptions and deductions for high earners. The Center for American Progress released a series of policy recommendations for “ensuring that middle- and lower-income households are the substantial beneficiaries” of economic growth.|1
"(CNN) — Portuguese sailors called it the ""Gates of Hell."" Namibia's Bushmen speak of the land God made in anger. From the air, the bleak shoreline of the Skeleton Coast looks wonderful -- a deep green sea, fringed with surf, breaks over a shore receding into infinite dunes. From land, it's a different story. The Benguela Current rushes in, urgent and strong, hurtling the chilling Atlantic into the fierce heat of the Namib. Whale and seal skeletons from the former whaling industry still litter the coastline -- the source of the region's frightening name."|1

We chose to question the narrative of history by simply quoting words which Churchill used himself.

Under Trump , presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor . Since discovering on his Twitter account in April 2017 that his predecessor, President Obama, had pardoned an ex-Trump adviser, Michael Flynn, Trump has sought to reward such loyalty with pardons of other prominent Trump supporters and enemies. The list includes Michael Cohen, Michael Flynn, and Jeff Sessions (he pardoned the former Sessions). In addition, he has pardoned the former Trump adviser Roger Stone, who was sentenced for lying to the federal investigators after he bragged on Twitter about having “obtained” Hillary Clinton’s emails.|0

The first image of Earth from lunar orbit . Before an Apollo-era NASA could launch a few humans on top of a rocket in hopes of landing one or two on the surface, there were two key steps that had to be taken for the lunar landings to be possible.

On January 31st, 1963, the Apollo 11 launch was successfully achieved. However, that same day another mission was launched, this one being the Lunar Orbiter 3 orbiter.|0

WINNIPEG — Turning trash into treasure is somewhat of an art form, but the new season of a HGTV reality show will tackle that head-on with some expert help. Produced by Canadian film company Frantic Films, “Buy It, Fix It, Sell It” follows a cast of refurbishing professionals bidding on second-hand items at auctions in Winnipeg and Toronto, only to turn them into designer or collector items and sell them to see who can make the biggest profit. Mike Wolchock, and his brother Joe, are known as the Neon Brothers on the show.|1
Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because of flaws in the way universal credit is designed, campaigners say. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG ) said arbitrary rules built in to the way universal credit is calculated leave some families unable to predict how much they will be paid each month, leaving households in debt and unable to budget. It can lead to claimants being wrongly benefit-capped – a penalty designed to “incentivise” jobless or low-earning households by severely limiting their benefits – because the system fails to spot they are working and earning enough.|1
Why Did This Woman Walk Away From Earning $600,000? It takes a lot of courage to quit your job and start a venture of your own. It takes something entirely else to walk away from a finance job that pays you over half a million dollars a year, and create a new media property – teaching yourself Final Cut Pro via Lynda.com, taking sketch comedy writing classes through Upright Citizens Brigade, writing, editing and starring in your own videos, and filling a perceived void in the market with no guarantee for success.|1
Beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl is never easy . When they scored 21 points the first three times they came after the quarterback, they did it with just six players and two defensive backs . Now it will be a little different. The Ravens will have seven defensive backs, seven players on offense, four offensive line, and five wide receivers (three of those will be rookies). This could get very interesting. In an article written last week, Bill Belichik of USA Today had an interesting idea on how to beat New England at home.|0
The Jewish-American advocacy group J Street , which bills itself as the dovish alternative to the influential American Israel Public Policy Institute (AIPAC), is facing some serious backlash for hosting a conference this past weekend titled “How Do We Protect Israel From its Enemies?” According to the Washington Post , the gathering included a number of speakers with ties to anti-Israel and pro-war groups who argued Israel should be isolated and demonized because “Israel is indefensible and not legitimate.” The Post reports that at least three of these anti-Israel and anti-peace advocates have been targeted for boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaigns by the group J-Street.|0
Last week, we learned that the Obama administration is considering other alternatives to stop foreclosures. Today, we have some color on what one of these efforts might look like. It would encourage servicers to reduce struggling borrowers' mortgage balance. Although banks have fought such efforts in the past, it seems that the program could benefit everyone involved. And the best part: it wouldn't take any taxpayer dollars. Of the residential mortgage-backed securities outstanding, about $1.3 trillion are so-called private label notes that were issued by banks and other financial institutions, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.|1

Doing business in British Columbia is particularly challenging because of the province’s reputation as a hotbed of environmental and aboriginal activism.

It has seemed for a while as though the global financial storm was going to deal a mostly glancing blow to President Trump’s financial empire. After all, his wealth grew substantially during his first presidential campaign, as well as afterwards. As it happened, the Trump administration’s budget proposed cutting a number of federal agencies by a combined $9 billion in fiscal 2019, and slashing hundreds of millions in the Pentagon’s budget overall. And yet, the Trump Organization’s net worth increased by $5.2 billion in the first fiscal year after his inauguration.|0
Teaching language to an artificial intelligence system is child’s play, thanks to MIT. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a parser that imitates kids’ learning processes by observing the environment and making connections. The system studies captioned videos and learns to associate words with objects and actions. When given a new sentence, the parser can accurately predict its meaning—without visual clues. This “weakly supervised” approach, which requires limited training input, could expand the types of data and reduce the effort needed for training parsers. Annotations can certainly speed up the process, but they’re not needed to learn.|1

Certainly one of the most brilliant dialogues in the ballet is its pas de deux. It was danced excellently and very dif ferently by twirl casts last week end in the New York City Bal let's current season at the State Theater. Sunday night marked the welcome return, after almost year's absence, of Arthur Mit dell. Matching the crystalline purity of Kay Mazzo, Mr. Mit 001 swung into his original sole with admirable flow and brio. By contrast, the catlike stealth of Jean‐Pierre Bonne fous in his local debut in the role gave it a note of emotion ally colored caution.|1
One minute he was strutting around the end zone, staring into the stands, the look of a stone-cold killer in his eyes. The next, Golden Tate was tossing his helmet to the ground in a fit of frustration, stunned – like most everyone else in Ford Field – at what he’d just heard. The Detroit Lions had a win stolen from them in the cruelest of fashions Sunday, when Matthew Stafford appeared to throw the game-winning touchdown pass to Tate with 8 seconds left, only to have the score overturned on replay and the game ended by a mandatory 10-second clock runoff.|1

On April 22, 2014, Hollingsworth was supposed to drop off 20-month-old Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth at a child-care center about 7:30 a.m. But he “forgot her in the car,” according to an arrest warrant affidavit filed by a North Richland Hills police investigator. “This is a disabled veteran who had several things on his mind that day and just forgot,” Lex Johnston of Hurst, Hollingsworth’s attorney, said Tuesday. Johnston said Hollingsworth’s daughter and four children were living with him, and he took the daughter to work, paid for child care and drove the grandchildren to day care or school.|1

A Houston district court judge who lost a re-election bid on Tuesday is facing criticism for releasing a majority of his campaign funds during his campaign for the 7th District court bench to help pay for personal debts, including medical bills. Judge Ed Emmett released all funds from his campaign in early March, even though the election was held last week.

Evan Spiegel's once-buzzy company is laying off employees as it cuts back on hiring. Just a few months after its euphoric debut on the public market was stifled by a series of increasingly bleak earnings reports, Snapchat parent company Snap is laying off a handful of employees for the second time this month. Business Insider reports that 18 employees from Snap’s recruiting division have been let go. While those employees represent less than 1 percent of the company’s total headcount, Snapchat also plans to pump the brakes on hiring next year.|1
Low-income working families are losing hundreds of pounds each year – and being wrongly denied free healthcare entitlements – because they don’t receive the benefit of the Government’s £2 Universal Credit payment. That payment has allowed claimants to get a regular ‘payday’ – a lump sum payment that replaces wages in a month after a period of employment. However, this year it has also been abolished because it would have created an “imbalance” between those who earn less than £80,000 and those who earn more. Instead, they will see their payments rise by less than 2%.|0
Other events add to the excitement. They, too, are a lot of work. But they add up to a great feeling of celebration that gives us a moment to reflect on the things we love about our country. The huge water balloon fight that one Richland neighborhood organizes is a fun reminder that we are all in this together. We suspect that a great many of us don't know our neighbors well. People are more likely to have friends on Facebook who may live on the other side of the country than friends on their street.|1

French President Emmanuel Macron wants to invigorate the European Union as a global power and spurn the populist nationalism that is threatening its future. But for the French, this would mean abandoning the European project. So far, it seems that Macron has taken a more nuanced view of Europe than the French public might like.

Still, most attempts to recreate the power glove mentality, to let you use your hands to naturally manipulate digital objects in three dimensions, have been failures.|1

Over the next few months, many federal employees will receive performance ratings. Some may believe their ratings to be unreasonably low. What can be done? There is a review process for most employees, but that process generally functions within the agency’s control (with exceptions for bargaining unit employees and successful equal employment opportunity complainants) and is often criticized as being unfriendly to complaining employees. Nonetheless, an appeal might be successful if an employee is careful, thorough and able to strike the right notes. Appeals take numerous forms. Following is a summary of different groups of employees and how the processes may differ.|1

Running errands on your bicycle is a great way to burn calories and get some exercise. When you need something small or you are just checking prices and availability, pedaling to the store can be a pleasant experience if you can find a bicycle-friendly route. Several major shopping locations in the Rogue Valley can be accessed by bicycles without encountering excessive traffic. For example, both the Rogue Valley Mall and the Medford Shopping Center are easily accessible from the Bear Creek Greenway bicycle path. It is somewhat more difficult to ride a bike to the big-box stores along Highway 62 (Crater Lake Highway).|1

JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar: for more than two decades, women have been making a monthly pilgrimage to pray at one of Judaism’s holiest sites in a manner traditionally preserved for men, and the police have stopped them in the name of maintaining public order.

In a study from 24/7 Wall Street , Leelanau County was named Michigan 's most expensive housing market with a median price tag of $1.2 million per property. Of the 1.8 million housing units in the county in the first half of 2019, 1.8% were affordable, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIH).

The rapper could be heading to jail over child support again . ( AllHipHop News ) Chief Keef should be in jail. He's a menace to society and he should be locked in a mental hospital. Not only has this man gone on a murder spree, but he's also made light of the fact that he's a victim in his own crimes. The rapper was sentenced to six months in jail in December for failing to pay child support for a child he's supposedly fathered. Now he's being charged with a second crime for not paying child support in the state of Texas.|0
The Scimitar-horned Oryx no longer lives in the African desert. It is considered extinct in the wild. But this lovely-looking Ungulate hasn’t been completely wiped out because they can still be found at zoos around the world. It’s just one example of a new role that zoos have taken on: preserving endangered wildlife. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lists 361 endangered mammals worldwide. Add in birds, fish, reptiles and other living creatures, that number rises to nearly 1200. That’s why the work of organizations like the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute – or SCBI – is so crucial.|1

No doubt if you are into painting of the artistic kind then you will probably know that artist Thomas Kinkade was one of the most influential illustrators of the last century. A man of great talent, I say this knowing that most people who know nothing about him may not have noticed that he had been a trained artist. One thing in common about the works of this artist and most other artist of that period is that they were all painted on canvas. Now this canvas is a huge thing that you would not want to sit on.

Jill McGown, who has died aged 59 from cancer, was one of the generation of crime writers who shifted the genre firmly into the contemporary world. Although she held fast to the traditional skill of well-crafted plots, she brought a modern perspective to characters and situations, creating a series of thoughtful and engaging police procedurals. She will be best remembered for the 13 novels featuring Chief Inspector Danny Lloyd and Sergeant Judy Hill. Theirs was a relationship that encompassed the personal as well as the professional, and Jill's deft handling of its development was one of the keynote elements of the books.|1

An extra $190,000 in state special education reimbursement funding that came in late last month has helped the town pay off its nearly half million-dollar settlement with the district's bus drivers union, officials said this week. Together with around $300,000 in savings found in the district's fiscal 2011 budget, the money has covered the town's $497,000 obligation to the drivers, whose jobs have been outsourced to a private busing company. The additional special education money, part of the state's circuit breaker program, will prevent the town from having to carry the debt over into fiscal 2012, officials said.|1

TOPEKA ( AP ) - A bill that would rescind restrictions on the development of private property near historical sites was sent to Gov. Sam Brownback Friday for signature. The bill is similar to one vetoed by the former governor in 2014, which required developers to preserve land in historic districts when building new structures. The governor said in a statement he had signed the bill to reverse an executive order that prevented the use of state funds to finance land preservation and other restoration efforts in areas with more than one historic designation, as was the case with the Fort Scott, Kansas City and Council Grove neighborhoods.|0

The “ digital workforce ” may sound like science fiction , conjuring up images of lines of robots running through the hallways of call centers . But by the end of the decade, the world will have the technology to put this vision into action—and do it much faster and cheaper than anyone had thought. That's not because computers will have taken over and replaced humans altogether—they won't. Computers are just more capable than humans of doing these basic tasks. They're more able to do things we humans used to do well, like make phone calls on hold, file reports, take notes, and send emails.|0

Steve Norris is former Conservative transport minister. Britain can reasonably claim to have invented the railway. Stephenson’s Rocket represented the pinnacle of British industrial-era innovation. The ability to move products and people by steam locomotion had a transformative effect on society.

The same techniques are being used to maintain track now that were used in Stephenson’s time."|1

So we drink unicorn lattes, eat rainbow bagels, and lick our charcoal-black soft serve in front of neon signs. Food is no longer about eating. It’s about the documentation of unattainable perfection, catching the next ever-illusive meme. Yet in this new wave of food-as-influencer, there is a single, curmudgeonly brand that insists on photographing its dishes on conference room tables, under fluorescent lighting, and from all sorts of unflattering angles.|1

French President Emmanuel Macron wants to invigorate the European Union as a global power and spurn the populist nationalism that threatens to undermine its success. But he knows it requires cooperation with the United States—which makes his strange bedfellow in the White House so crucial to his agenda. This piece originally appeared in the Washington Post. Macron, who at 40 is three decades younger than Trump, disdains the president’s abrasive nature and many of his policies, notably on Iran and climate change. The French president prefers books, ideas and lofty intellectual conversation to the aggressive transactional style embodied by Trump, who favors television over written text.|1

WASHINGTON — House Democrats on Friday unveiled a comprehensive elections and ethics reform package that targets what they call a “deeply rooted” problem: a long-standing system in which members of the House sit on the sidelines when legislation moves to the floor and vote to advance it, even though they have no official role in it or its passage. The measure would establish a committee that would be led by a member chosen by the Majority Leader, and would hold public hearings to gather input from the public about the impact of proposed changes. The committee would then draft legislation based on the input from members and other stakeholders.|0

Born in the country and fluent in the language, Gursewak Singh considers himself Japanese. The government doesn't. But it sometimes offers children like him a chance to stay - if their parents agree to leave. MATSUDO, Japan – Gursewak Singh composed his first letter to Japan’s justice minister when he was 10 years old. Almost seven years later, he is still writing. In all, he has written more than 50 letters. He has yet to get a reply. The letters, all written in Japanese, have become more eloquent as Gursewak has grown up.|1
My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors . This knowledge is important to understand and control cell growth and development. One of the most important questions that we are trying to address is: How do cells of different tissues and organs with the same genetic code acquire unique gene expression patterns? We are also interested in the mechanisms that cells use to regulate growth, division, and development. To address these questions, we use two different model systems of cells with similar DNA sequences.|0
He ’ s eaten dog food and appeared nearly naked on telly , but comedian Alex Horne has revealed his bodybuilding past to a packed out audience at the London Comedy Festival .

""It was developed without consultation of the folks that are supposed to keep us safe, and the president really messed this up, and he needs to pull it down.

Fast bowler Matt Hobden has been tipped for a bright future as he bids to bounce back from one of the darkest days in his fledgling career. Hobden’s encouraging start to the season came to a grinding halt in the previous Championship match against Middlesex at Hove. The 22-year-old from Eastbourne lost his rhythm completely as he committed 11 no-balls in 16 overs in the first innings and another three in the second. His struggles were highlighted by an injury to Ajmal Shahzad on the opening day which prevented skipper Ed Joyce from withdrawing him from the attack.|1
When reconciliation becomes a last-minute vote catcher, only the deepest, most corrosive cynicism is possible. Trampling on the rights of others for political advantage was the modus operandi of Adelaide's Nomenclature Committee in 1837. Western Buddhism and Pentecostalism are sometimes criticised as self-indulgent forms of religion. Is Bishop Spong's Christian humanism any different? The press coverage of Iraq’s surprise victory in the Asian Cup final was — as Ernst Bloch might have put it — full of utopian sentiment. The win was, admittedly, a remarkable achievement, but one that hardly accounted for the sheer exuberance of the outpoured emotion that followed.|1
"Sunni Fighters Returning To Al-Qaida In Iraq, 'NYT' Reports : The Two-Way After months of being squeezed out by the Shi'ite led government, there are increasing reports that men who used to fight against al-Qaida are now being recruited by them. The success of the ""surge"" in Iraq was based on a number of things beyond the introduction of more American troops and their counter insurgency strategy. Among them, cease fire by Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army, the ethnic cleansing of Baghdad, and the Sunni Awakening. The Awakening was made up of Sunnis who turned against al-Qaida in Iraq in their areas."|1
At least 21 people were killed and hundreds wounded in four days of fighting between two rival tribes in the eastern Nigeria village of Mubi, the latest round of violence that has sparked fears of a return to bloodshed.

Chipolo Plus is supposedly the loudest Bluetooth item tracker available today, and its chirpy tune can be heard from a greater distance than other similar trackers. Thanks to some useful new tech, items gone missing around the house or office can announce their locations with chirpy ditties — as long as they have Bluetooth trackers attached and you're close enough to hear the trackers' songs. So can you tell the difference between those dB levels? In my tests, I could indeed hear Chipolo Plus a little bit better than the other trackers, though the difference is subtle.|1

Amazon.com's purchase of Austin-based Whole Foods Market is showing up in the wine category. As this year ends, Amazon has shut down Wine.Woot and its own wine marketplace in favor of Whole Foods' expansive wine operation. Now that Amazon owns Whole Foods, a licensed seller of wine, it comes under different state laws and can't sell directly from a producer. As a result, Dallas entrepreneur Matt Rutledge sees an opening in the marketplace. When Amazon.com purchased daily deals site Woot.com, based in Carrollton, in 2010 it also acquired Wine.Woot, a direct producer-to-consumer website that Amazon adopted for its own wine marketplace.|1

The effect is greatest for those who are most likely to suffer it—the very young and older. We have already seen the effects of sleep loss on our health. A good example of how our sleep affects us and contributes to our health problems is our increased risk of heart attacks during the first few nights of a month that we’ve spent on holiday.|0

Unlike a cellphone that resides in your pocket or a bag, the Up wraps around your wrist, exposed to the world just as much as your skin is.

Under Trump, presidential pardons have become a way to reward blind loyalty—and to punish his predecessor. Since discovering that the constitution gives him the somewhat controversial power to absolve criminals who are also his friends, Donald Trump has pardoned more people and commuted more sentences in his first 18 months in office than any of his three immediate predecessors. The pardoning spree continued on Tuesday, as Trump issued two more before jetting off to Europe to stomp all over NATO, this time clearing the names of father-son arsonist duo Dwight and Steven Hammond, Oregon cattle ranchers whose 2016 fight against the federal government became a conservative cause célèbre.|1

House Republicans weren ’ t talking about the economy as they left Washington for the August recess before a challenging stretch of work, but they had plenty of reasons to do so. President Trump’s surprise decision to pull out U.S. military forces from Syria and Iraq and begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan left lawmakers in Washington to deal with the economic fallout from the chaos he helped create. Trump’s tax bill passed with just enough Democratic support to allow him to sign the legislation, but the bill has failed to bring in much new money, raising the risk that the federal deficit will rise.|0

"A Dallas County jury found Jesus Trevino , 33 , guilty of capital murder Monday in the death of 37-year-old Terence Crump, who was beaten to death with a baseball bat on Sept. 2, 2009. Tevino is expected to die in prison. The Dallas County district attorney said he will ask the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for a reversal of his conviction because of a juror's comments to the effect that he felt ""humiliated"" when he realized the defendant would not be sentenced to life in prison without parole. The state will appeal the verdict."|0
Women who work in the White House do earn equal pay. Another right-made-up fact. The Republicans with their 12 percent approval rating, don’t you wonder who are the 12 percent that think the people driving the clown car are doing a good job? The right has a war on the middle class and women. Republican restriction policies like voting for TRAP laws (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) that make it harder for women to find safe and legal abortion providers near home drive the market share to butcherous and crazy doctors. Restricting voters. Refusing to explain Medicaid so poor people can have healthcare.|1
Black Starlets coach Samuel Fabin says his side were not threatened at any point in their convincing win over India in their last game group at the ongoing U-17 FIFA World Cup. Ghana impressively saw off host nation India 4-0 in their last match of Group A at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi on Thursday. A brace from captain Eric Ayiah and substitute attackers Richard Danso and Emmanuel Toku were enough to send Ghana through to the next round as group winners. And in coach Fabin's post-match interview, he expressed his surprise at the lack of fight from his opponents despite winning raves of admirers in their opening two games.|1

A cartographer that created maps for senior policy makers at the National Counterterrorism Center wants to map out your next hunt or backpacking trip. Ben Harshyne and his wife Kate Harshyne took a risk this year when Ben left his job as a contractor where he made maps for the National Counterterrorism Center and chose to work full time on a company he started called HUNTERRA Mapping. HUNTERRA creates maps by blending high-resolution aerial photography with a 3D-like terrain model. The company can create waterproof, tear resistant field maps, poster maps and custom-sized mega maps.|1

JERUSALEM — The face-off at the security gate outside the Western Wall one Friday this month was familiar : for years, I had gone regularly to pray at the Wall before going home. But now I was not going to pray on my walk to my car after services, because the gates had been closed to worshippers. That was a relief. I had been praying for some weeks in my home in Haifa, the Arab city at the southern end of the Gulf. The Wall has been closed to worshippers for almost two decades, since the Six Day War of 1967.|0
Sean Bean has made a career of being around royalty in epic fantasy . He was the heir to the King-in-Exile throne in Kingkiller Chronicle (2004) and its two sequels, before the series was canceled after the third. He then took the King-in-Exile character and created a much more complex take on it in the Kingkiller Chronicle II, which ended in 2012. Now he’s returned with The Kingmaker, the newest addition to his Kingkiller Chronicle trilogy. A new Kingmaker book is a rarity these days, and one of those rare times is when the author is a fan of the source material.|0
I’m still not convinced Foreman is the answer — they’d be crazy not to draft a running back next year — but for now Foreman might get goalline work and has speed to do a little more. When Cooper Kupp sustained an ACL tear, the question was whether Reynolds could step into his role as an equal partner in the Rams’ pass-catching triumvirate. He leaped the first hurdle with flying colors: six catches for 80 yards and a score against the Chiefs. The Rams operate out of three-receiver 11 personnel an insane 98 percent of time, per sharpfootballstats.com.|1
My research aims to improve our understanding of how cells with the same genome can develop dramatically different behaviors. For example, consider the mechanical abilities of a muscle cell compared to the electrical excitability of a neuron, or the industrious activity of bone building cells in a youthful person compared to an elderly one. Each of these cells, (if taken from the same individual) has an identical genome — and yet each is “reading” a very distinct subset of that genome and consequently carrying out very different behaviors. The choice of what to read and what to hide away is made during development.|1
There was no shortage of activity taking place on the Grammy stage Sunday night – Motown tributes , Havana reproductions, and, of course, Beyonce's Lemonade (just to name a few). It was such an intense event that the Grammy telecast could be described as a cross between a concert event and a news conference, all the way down to the incessant commentary from the various members of the media in attendance. This year's event was no different than last year's Grammys, except for one thing: this time the Grammys were broadcast live and in its entirety on MTV.|0

In recent years, platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their artistry. For the generation of designers who grew up playing “Super Mario Bros.” platformers offer a sound formula. Though the goal of such games is usually to get from one area to the next, that framework supports copious possibilities. Determining how a character moves through a world and what sorts of things should impede or assist in the process allows plenty of room for creativity. It is why games like “Journey” and “Inside” can both be constructed around jumping avatars but otherwise appear quite distinct.|1
According to a new poll by pro-business policy group the Bay Area Council , 34 percent of Bay Area residents say they would rather go to jail rather than pay their fair share on taxes. “It’s pretty clear there is a desire for some kind of change in how we all pay our taxes in the Bay Area”, said Jim Wunderman, vice president of policy for the Bay Area Council, in a recent phone interview. So why isn’t this change in law happening? A few reasons: California’s tax code is a mess.|0

I guess it is a bit too early to give it away , and it would have been great to have a few more character reveals . However , that might not be a problem , since the story is a little short .|0
Could Washington state elect the greenest governor in the nation? All around the country this election season, we’ve got Democrats who don’t want to talk about climate change and Republicans who don’t even acknowledge that climate change is real. But in the Washington state governor’s race, it’s a whole different ballgame. The Democrat, Jay Inslee, is a longtime, outspoken crusader for climate action and clean energy. The Republican, Rob McKenna, is one of a vanishing breed of Republicans who not only acknowledge that climate change is happening but support government action to fight it.|1
Every day leading up to the start of the 2017 prep football season, we'll feature a different Acadiana team. Catch up on all the previews right here. Rhett Peltier faced some very clear challenges when the Loreauville offensive coordinator took over the Tigers’ football program.

BANGKOK ( Reuters ) - The leader of Thailand ’ s military junta said on Thursday that Yingluck Shinawatra , his sister and de facto leader of the nation, should be “removed from the throne” in a bid to end an increasingly divisive power struggle between her and Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , her half-brother. In a surprise move after months of internal wrangling within Thailand’s army, Gen Thaksin said he would step down after elections in November in what could be the biggest victory for his party Shin Corp. since democracy was restored after two decades of a military dictatorship.|0
Women who work in the White House do earn equal pay . Another right-made-up fact .

Today marks the 314th anniversary of the last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. Geological records indicate that this 9.0 magnitude quake struck around 9 p.m. Jan. 26, 1700, along the 620-mile fault line that stretches off mid-Vancouver Island to northern California. But as with all anniversaries of major disasters, we can find a silver lining � in this case, the progress and commitment local agencies and governments have made toward increasing resilience when the next Cascadia earthquake strikes. Oregon�s offshore seismic fault mirrors the subduction zone that caused the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami that killed thousands of people and destroyed entire villages.|1
The University of Arkansas at Fort Smith recently told student Jennifer Braly that she was prohibited from giving lectures about being transgender to classes on campus, despite the fact that faculty were eager to feature her presentations. Braly suspected it was because she had sued the school for other forms of discrimination she faced. This week, the university reversed its policy restricting Braly to gender-neutral bathrooms after the Department of Justice sent a letter on her behalf. Trans students will now be able to use the bathroom corresponding to the gender with which they identify.|1

In a democracy , it is said , we get the government we deserve . The same can be said of any democracy. When a government has lost all legitimacy it will eventually fail to provide services to the people. If the government is corrupt and incompetent , it will only serve as an excuse to people to leave. In a free country , people should not be driven to leave the country because the country has failed to keep its promise. They should not leave because of the incompetence of the government. These are the arguments for freedom of movement.|0

After a six-week long trial, Judge Richard Leon set a hearing date of June 12 at 4 p.m. (2000 GMT) to announce his ruling. People were so keen to get a seat in his courtroom that they took turns standing in line more than 24 hours ahead of the event.|1
Clinton said this week paid family leave is possible by taxing the wealthy but states have done so without soaking the rich. In her opening statement at the first Democratic debate Tuesday, Hillary Clinton mentioned the need for paid family leave, and when asked about it later, she said it was possible to pay for it by having the wealthy foot the bill. The line may be good fodder for Democrats, but looking at how states have done it, as well as current national proposals, show other ways to pay for the policy without soaking the rich.|1

"For Bruce Logan, microbes are an electrifying subject. The Kappe professor of environmental engineering at Pennsylvania State University works on creating alternative-fuel cells powered by anaerobic bacteria.

Barack Obama’s presidency has coincided with immense growth of social media services like Facebook and Twitter. And today, the White House released the Social Media Archive, a searchable collection of more than a quarter million posts across more than 100 different Obama Administration accounts. The idea?

The tool makes it easy to plug in search terms and then see an exhaustive collection of all posts that match.|1

While the SP-BSP-RLD alliance may disrupt the caste math in many pockets , the Congress is relegated to the role of facilitator , with party chief Sonia Gandhi’s support. While the RSS is in a position of power in Gujarat , it is only the BJP which has emerged a ‘force to reckon with’ in Gujarat . However, the BJP may soon face a problem it is least aware of, as the BJP, with the support of Gujarat, is now in power in the state. It is in the BJP-ruled Gujarat that the RSS is going to encounter its maximum challenge.|0
The new law finishes old business in Trenton and expands the so-called Tuition Equality Act , which let qualified immigrants attend state colleges at no additional charge. Now, a college-educated immigrant with a four-year degree from the United States or Canada can apply to attend any state college at no cost to the student. Previously, students had to pay to attend. That makes the new law not only a victory for President Barack Obama and for college students, but it's also a victory for young people generally who, like the rest of Americans, want more education in order to advance their careers.|0

"I lived in Oshkosh for 14 years up until 2003. My hangar was adjacent to the self-serve. Our pre-Air Venture entertainment was to sit by the hangar and watch the incoming.

The one comment that comes close to probably covering it all was a pilot some years back who caused some real havoc when asked why he did not adhere to the NOTAM, said, ""what NOTAM?"""|1

Two years ago, Red Sox prospect Ryan Westmoreland seemed to be on the fast track to the majors. The Portsmouth native, who the Sox selected in the fifth round of the 2008 draft, got off to a blazing start in his professional career in 2009 in Single-A Lowell. In 60 games with the Spinners, the outfielder hit .296 with seven homers and 19 stolen bases, and his five-tool potential helped him quickly ascend up everyone's list of top Red Sox prospects. But all of that changed in a hurry when, in March of 2010, he was diagnosed with a cavernous malformation in his brain.|1
"Capital abundance , low interest rates , and high volatility are creating new challenges and opportunities in equity markets . However, these same factors also make the equity markets more volatile, which creates risks for the equity markets . The following are some of those risks:

Market Risk

In an equity market, investors often lose money, which is defined as the difference between a security's price before the investment and the security's current market value.

There is broad agreement that moving patient records into the computer age is essential to improving care and curbing costs. But the challenges to integrating computerized records vary considerably, according to who is involved in the change and when. For example, some hospital organizations that have tried to use the computerized records of physicians and hospital systems to drive down costs also worry that doctors and their staff may not be trained to use the systems effectively, or that the quality of care will suffer. Others are more optimistic. They believe that the shift from paper and pencil records to electronic records will lead to better patient care.|0

Late in the morning, Metro told riders about the delays via Twitter. Many riders had been complaining about missing buses or longer-than usual waits for hours.|1

There were two dividing impulses in Robin Williams 's performances that could , roughly , be called his American and his British influences. The American impulse , which in many ways is the better of the two , comes out of his first two films – ‘ Robin Williams: A Night at the Theatre ,’ in 1977 , and then ‘ Dead Poet 's Society ,’ a performance-study film from 1983 – and its influence on Williams 's career in the following four years was significant. The British impulse is the more interesting of the two.|0

I was delighted to read in Eureka Street Ruby Hamad’s passionate protest that she and other Muslims should not constantly be called to account for the vicious behaviour of IS. Still less to be stigmatised until unnamed Muslim leaders disowned it. I was disconcerted to see so many Eureka Street readers appeared to agree with the demands against which she protested. Both Ruby’s complaint and the responses to it reminded me of the attitudes taken to Catholics in an earlier generation. The popular charges against Catholics were honed in the Great War and particularly by the referenda on Conscription.|1

And of course, all they could say was, he didn’t really do anything “real”. They had a “con” for the president and they were sticking by him.|0

Kubrick deemed the score inadequate for the film, and replaced it with the classical musical tracks that are so familiar today. North wasn't aware of the change until the film premiered.|1

The U.S. government is charging that Google is systematically paying women less than their male counterparts. Testifying in a San Francisco court Friday, Department of Labor (DOL) regional director Janette Wipper said the government “found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” according to a report in The Guardian.

Ryanair has lowered its full year profit guidance from a current range of €1.25-€1.35 billion to a new range of €1.10-€1.20 billion. The decision, which saw shares in the airline fall by more than ten per cent, comes after a turbulent period for the low-cost carrier. The Irish airline was recently hit by a fall in traffic after pilots and cabin crew in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Portugal went on strike. Ryanair has also been forced to lower fares for the third quarter of the year (particularly for the October school half-term holidays and Christmas) as customer confidence has been affected by fear of further strikes.|1
Most people have heard of Scrooge , even if they have never read A Christmas Carol or any other work by Charles Dickens. Dickens' stories were popular during the Victorian Era (1814-1901).

The film incorrectly states the city of Tikal is in Mexico when it is in Guatemala. Secrets of the Dead strives to get the facts correct and we regret the error.|1

Many Alberta small-business owners , who have been struggling through a prolonged economic downturn , are hoping the next provincial election campaign will provide relief from the crippling uncertainty they feel about the economy. It’s not that they’ve been complacent. Their businesses are struggling — and it’s not only because of the current global recession, but because of the province’s own long and painful recession in the 1990s, which is widely considered to be the most severe since the Depression. The Alberta Chamber of Commerce and Industry last month reported that 51,000 new jobs were lost in Alberta in October of 2008 alone.|0

Mugabe rejected the demand, saying the ruling party's victory was not illegitimate. Zimbabwe has been in political and economic turmoil since its independence from Britain in 1980, when its white minority ruler, Ian Smith, seized power and ruled until 1990.|0

"A syrah lover finds hope in the Northwest , but sticks to his guns about the failure of many to appreciate its qualities

There is a place in Oregon where you are likely to find someone who thinks the wine country of the state is the finest in the world. It is the town of Cannon Beach, where the Oregonian recently found a syrah lover, who, with some reluctance, wrote a letter to the Oregon Wine Blog. But the wine blogger never received that letter, because it was never sent. I, meanwhile, have tried dozens and dozens of Oregon wines, and I am a huge fan."|0

"The right sheet set and pajamas can help you stay cool. Today’s memory-foam mattresses don't sleep as ""hot"" as older models did, thanks to air-circulating layers and ventilated toppers that keep the foam from absorbing and retaining all your body heat. But a certain insulating effect is unavoidable when you're sleeping on a foam block. If your memory foam mattress leaves you sweating at night, a few remedies can help turn down the heat -- if only by a few degrees. Anything you can do to distance your body from the memory foam will help keep you cool."|1

Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the hard work required to maintain it. Amid the hubbub of shopping centers and the din of traffic from nearby Hwy. 61, the cemetery sandwiched between McDonald's and Tires Plus seems jarringly out of place. Few pause to notice the prim patch of well-tended green, bounded by an iron fence, that holds some of Cottage Grove's earliest pioneers. The cemetery, designated a historic site by the Washington County Historical Society, has ties to the founders of Mars Inc., the giant candy manufacturing company.|1

For three turbulent centuries, the glimpse of a square sail and dragon-headed prow on the horizon struck terror into the hearts of medieval Europeans. Indeed, the Viking Age, from A.D. 800-1100, was the age of the sleek, speedy longship. Without this crucial advance in ship technology, the Vikings would never have become a dominant force in medieval warfare, politics, and trade. With their invention of the longship, the Vikings spurred a literal sea change in medieval European affairs. The drekar, or dragon-headed longships, were stealthy troop-carriers.|1

Gone up front is all-American defensive end Terry Beckner Jr . — now at the University of Missouri — but LaMontre’ Harvey, Antuan Quinlin and Terres Lagrome, are quick agile linemen who return.|1

He is right, of course, that pretending all sides of any controversy are equally valid is nonsense. But a good deal of the issue hinges on our definition of ""teaching"" a position. If ""teaching"" means that the teacher merely presents all sides of a controversy as though they were equal in weight and legitimacy, then we are being equal time indoctrinists."|1

"The proposal that foreign powers acquire land in Africa to stem migration is nothing but 'hipster' colonialism. Last week, Germany's Africa Commissioner Gunter Nooke said that European countries should be allowed to lease land and to build and run cities in Africa as a means of stemming what he views as the unchecked expansion of migration from Africa to Europe. For Nooke, allowing the ""free development"" of these areas would stimulate African economies and create ""growth and prosperity"" and therefore, reduce the attractiveness of Europe as a destination for migration.

Although state trademark registration offers fewer benefits than trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, state trademark registration can be a cheap alternative for securing limited trademark rights. Federal trademark registration can run anywhere from several hundred dollars to $3,000, depending on the type of mark being registered and the amount of attorney's fees. On the other hand, many states charge less than $100 to file a trademark application. Keep in mind that state registration will not offer multi-state protection, nationwide priority status, incontestability, a presumption of validity or the ability to file a trademark on an intent to use basis.|1

BUHLER - The south wall of Jim Baker Fieldhouse is considered hallowed ground at Buhler High. It's reserved for the Crusaders' state championship plaques - 36 of them in all. But none of them are in football. Coach Steve Warner wants to change that on Saturday when his Crusaders travel to Salina to play in their first state title game since 1990. Buhler (12-1) faces Coffeyville in the Kansas Class 4A championship game at 1 p.m., and a week of preparation has featured a buzz in a town that is ravenous for a first-ever state football championship.|1
"You have to give Square Enix points for honesty; Bravely Default: For the Sequel wears its primary intentions right on its sleeve. I mean, it's right in the title: ""For the Sequel."" The new updated version of the original Bravely Default: Flying Fairy is currently being developed in parallel to the game's upcoming as-of-yet untitled sequel. However, unlike your standard updated rerelease of a game, Square Enix is looking to use For the Sequel as a testing bed for the sequel (Christ, how many times am I going to have to use that term.)."|1
"The storm we're bracing for is the type of January variety everyone prepares for: monitor school closings, check flashlights and stock up on bread, eggs and milk. It's hard to know exactly how any storm will hit until it actually arrives. But there's a foreboding sense about what to expect in the coming days. ""We had something comparable in January 2014,"" said Aaron Reynolds, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Buffalo. That storm launched Buffalo's first official blizzard in 21 years at the time."|1
Gotham is dealing a familiar Joker in Season 2. Seemingly confirming what the Fox drama’s showrunner Bruno Heller shared with TVLine, Season 1 guest star Cameron Monaghan (Shameless) posted to Instagram a “police lineup” picture of him back in jocular Jerome mode. Gotham opens Season 2 on Monday, Sept. 21, where it now leads into the freshman drama Minority Report. * Homeland Season 5 has cast Ukrainian actor Mark Ivanir (Royal Pains) in the recurring role of Ivan Krupin, Saul’s intelligence counterpart in the SVR, THR reports.|1
A mother forges her son's signature on a letter of intent. A newly committed Georgia player hoists a live bulldog to celebrate his college choice. A top-rated quarterback tries to avoid an argument by telling his mother - by text message - that he's not picking her preferred school. Those were the highlights, or lowlights, of Signing Day, Act One. Act Two comes today in Rock Hill, S.C., when defensive end Jadeveon Clowney celebrates his 18th birthday and gives his parents what he calls a Valentine's Day present when he reveals his college choice live on ESPN.|1
OAKLAND — Nine people living in East Oakland discovered over the past nine months what it”s like to be a journalist — taking on the challenge of telling important but unheard stories from the community around them. Saturday, those nine budding journalists graduated from the Oakland Voices nonprofit program, which helped give them the tools to gather and report those stories. Oakland Voices is a project founded by Oakland Tribune senior community engagement editor Martin Reynolds and coordinated by veteran journalist Brenda Payton. By enlisting people from Oakland”s neighborhoods to tell Oakland stories, the project unravels tales of tragedy and triumph that are not covered by mainstream media.|1
"A jaunt through October 's art highlights . Eighty-eight-year-old Jack McLarty has had a distinguished career , with an exhibition that spans three decades. ""He was an artist for life,"" says McLarty's widow and longtime friend, Mary McLarty-Smith. Born in the Irish Midlands of England in the 1930s, Jack McLarty moved to Dublin as a teenager, studying at the National School of Art in his mid-20s. He attended the School of Art in the same year as his friend, the late Jack Nicholson, who studied painting and sculpture in that same school."|0
Why do we only hear about Jasper Johns when he gets ripped off? Jasper Johns is the greatest artist alive. It seems a shame that he only enters the headlines when people rip him off. Johns was in court this week to give evidence against a Queens, New York foundry owner, Brian Ramnarine, who has now pleaded guilty to faking one of the artist's works. It was a bronze version of one of the most iconic of all American paintings: Flag. Johns had made four bronze copies of Flag in 1960 at Ramnarine's foundry.|1
Syrian sources said April 14 that the Jordanian charge d'affaires in Lebanon, Hisham Moheisen, who was kidnapped from his residence Feb. 6, had been released in the Lebanese resort town of Shtoura. Monitor Mideast correspondent John Yemma reports that there was no immediate Western or Jordanian confirmation of this development. But several Lebanese media sources reported that Mr. Moheisen had been found -- one saying he was picked up by the Syrian Arab Deterrent Force near the besieged town of Zahle. Jordan has blamed Syria for the abduction. The two countries have had severely strained relations for almost six months and nearly went to war late last year.|1
When I opened the brown clasp envelope and pulled out the 21-page spiral book, I was startled. Dr. Jones is not a pianist. I’ve been having a good laugh at myself about it these last few weeks. (I guess I really do need hearing aids.) I told the story when I spoke to the Barrington Hall Garden Club last week, and the ladies got a chuckle out of it. Dr. Jones is passionate about peonies. At one time, he had 120 peony plants blooming in the backyard of his former home on Hillandale Circle.|1
Sen. Cory Booker , the New Jersey Democrat who ’ s launched a bid for the White House in 2020 , was among a dozen Democrats on Thursday morning who signed onto a bipartisan letter to President Trump expressing ’ s disappointment in the U. S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on curbing climate change and asking him to reconsider. “The United States cannot fulfill its role as a global leader for global climate action if the U. S. continues to refuse to be a part of this global effort,” Mr. Booker and the other signatories said in the letter.|0

Damn, aside from Tom Tykwer desperately trying to get out of there at the 30 minute mark, and their publicist throwing out a bit of a burn towards DP at the very end, it was a great interview. Loved the epic rants on the philosophical nature of “Revolutions,” as well as Andy Wachowski’s understandable annoyance with film junkets. Amazing interview…I wish I had the chance to catch the late screening with Q&A at Fantastic Fest…Profound love/respect/admiration to the Wachowskis, Tykwer, and you David. Cornel West was not joshing when he said Lana was laser smart.|1

A new study for The New York Times reveals that the media pay for the top 200 CEOs is now $14.5 million. This is up 55 in the last year. While any one CEO may be well worth his/her raise, it is a growing political and PR problem for corporate America to be seen as rewarding those at the top, with little consideration for actual performance. For millions of Americans who are unemployed, under employed and being foreclosed on, it seems inconceivable that corporate CEOs can be getting significant raises at a time of such economic hardship.|1
MANSEHRA , Nov 27 : Provincial Minister for Haj and Auqaf Nimroz Khan on Tuesday said time was not far when the Islamic Republic will open its Haj House to pilgrims from Pakistan and Afghanistan. The minister was talking to The Daily News while addressing a group of pilgrims who were visiting the Imam Ali shrine. “When will we be able to open our Haj house to all pilgrims who have visited the Holy shrine? We need to prepare ourselves for this. There will be a time when the country’s doors will be open to all.” said Nimroz Khan.|0
The best retirement financial advice you can get might be to get more sleep. That is the provocative implication of recent research that examined investors’ financial risk-taking following periods when their sleep was disrupted. I concede that advice to get more sleep is hardly new, since we’ve been hearing that most of our lives — and the advice is honored more in the breach than in the observance. Furthermore, retirees typically would like to sleep more, but can’t — due to the disruptions in sleep patterns that are a normal part of the aging process.|1
Australia 's Cordell Jigsaw Zapruder has got a toe-hold on New Zealand 's reality TV , buying Greenstone TV for US $3.2 million, NZNZ $3 million. Greenstone was an upstart in the ratings, a low-cost home for low-value TV, but it was oversubscribed to the point that there was no other media company in town to offer it the same service. If New Zealand is the first New Zealand TV market, then the question arises as to whether there is a market there for a homegrown television channel, or whether New Zealand's TV industry is already saturated with competitors.|0

"PARIS -- France could become the latest country to ban the use of underweight fashion models . France 's health minister says there is no scientific evidence to prove that overweight and obese models are damaging public health and the fashion industry will be allowed to use them again if their weight is not an issue. The ban would only apply to new models. France 's health department says it would be ""unwise"" to ban the use of women who are five or more stone overweight or obese because they are often young, healthy and fit to be models."|0
Toronto - A Porter Airlines Dash 8 with 54 on board encountered a UFO at a height of about 9,000 feet as it was making its descent into the Billy Bishop Airport on Toronto Islands. In a statement Porter Airlines said: “The pilots noticed an object in the distance (and) as they approached the object, they realized it was very close to their flight path.” The pilots at first thought the object was a balloon but after debriefing decided it could have been a drone.

Some Zimbabwe government supporters say President Robert Mugabe should form a government without the opposition, following an opposition boycott of talks Monday in Swaziland. Tendai Maphosa asked ordinary Zimbabweans in Harare what they think about this latest threat to the power-sharing deal signed last month and reports for VOA. After failing to agree on the allocation of Cabinet posts last week, Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change decided to refer the matter to the Southern African Development Community. They agreed to meet with SADC representatives earlier this week, but that meeting never took place.|1
Weather Underground on the Weather Channel : Highly gender-normative interactions . The lady sits behind the bar when the men are all at their tables. Then she orders a wine she doesn’t understand (“Vin sant?”) . Then she doesn’t like the wine.

Two cemeteries in Washington County are prime examples of the wealth of history that graveyards can hold -- and the value placed on the history of their own dead. For the Washington County cemetery where George Washington's headstone marks the grave of his first cousin, William, there is a lot to see. The headstone says George Washington and William Washington (1757-1824), and beneath the inscription is a list of descendants, including some who are buried on the same plot. There was a lot more to be seen as you walked across Washington Cemetery No.|0

Millions of refugees have fled their homes in war-torn Syria since 2011 . President Barack Obama previously planned to resettle 5,400 of them in the United States. But it now appears that the resettlement program may have reached its end. Under the program, which is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services to resettle up to 1,050 refugees a year, each individual would receive a year of benefits including health care, housing and food, and a $1,000 payment each month to help cover the costs of transportation to and from a resettlement site.|0

"In a small way, we made history. Last Saturday, an ad hoc group of citizens interested in improving an aspect of public policy sat down informally with the civil servants responsible and designed a web service to do the job.

While it ’ s not the most glamorous construction project , the state Department of Transportation says it ’ s the cheapest and best way to build roads on public property. It was just completed in November, but the work has already become a boon to area developers.

The AKP should take comfort in its large majority and start to view minority views and even peaceful dissent benignly. But it is unlikely that a party that has only been in power for 15 years will suddenly abandon the authoritarian methods that have brought it to power. That is one of the main reasons why it will take time to restore the country's political and economic order. It is already clear from the government's response to the recent Gezi protests that it may take a while to rebuild the foundations of order. This will require some patience from all parties and civil society organizations.|0
ORANGEBURG, S.C. — Talk-show host and media mogul Oprah Winfrey has conducted a jailhouse interview with a South Carolina mother who pleaded guilty to killing her two sons. Winfrey went to the jail in Orangeburg last week where 30-year-old Shaquan Duley is awaiting sentencing. Winfrey interviewed Duley’s family in September 2010, a month after Duley suffocated her 2-year-old and 18-month-old sons, then tried to stage their deaths by driving her car into a river. Prosecutors say she killed the children after being badgered by her mother about being a poor parent. Duley faces 30 years to life in prison when she’s sentenced Friday.|1

Today marks the 314th anniversary of the last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake . Geological records indicate that this 9.0 magnitude quake was followed by two even more powerful events, the next two that we know of. These three earthquakes were powerful enough to trigger the largest volcanic eruptions ever recorded: Mount St. Helens’ eruption from Mount Hood to the south in 1980, Mount Etna’s eruption from the same volcano to the northwest in 1983, and the eruption from Mount Lassen in Washington State in 1987. In addition, these super-eruptions were accompanied by a series of tsunamis in the Pacific.|0

Kids and computers can be a beautiful mix or a disaster waiting to happen. Education-based applications and popular games are some of the biggest reasons kids get on the computer, and the various dangers of the Internet are one of the biggest reasons parents shy away from granting free-reign access.

WINNIPEG — Turning trash into treasure is somewhat of an art form , but the new season of a HGTV series, “A Place for Stories” on Monday night, was something else entirely. The first night of the new season on Global Television, the show, based on a series of books by American author Laura Kasischke, took a very different tone. “The goal of this show really isn’t about finding treasure and hoarding it, but rather about community,” Kasischke told CTV News in an interview Sunday from her home in Winnipeg.|0
The “digital workforce” may sound like science fiction, conjuring up images of lines of robots running through an office. In truth, the digital workforce is a tangible reality. But, rather than teams of robots, it involves a more promising environment with people, automation, and artificial intelligence working side by side. This hybrid workforce is coming to life thanks to businesses that recognize the transformative potential in automation and AI. In a study by Genpact of 300 C-suite and senior executives, 79% of AI leaders – the companies generating impact from AI – expect their employees to be comfortable working alongside robots by 2020.|1

BAGHDAD -- The Iraqi government launched an investigation yesterday into the apparent torture of detainees in a secret Interior Ministry jail after the US military found 173 prisoners inside who appeared to have been abused, Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari said. It was the first time that the country's US-backed government installed in April had acknowledged the possible abuse of prisoners at one of its facilities. The detainees appeared to have been mostly Sunni Arabs, a group that has long contended that Shi'ite Muslim militias close to the political parties that dominate Iraq's ruling coalition are carrying out a shadowy campaign of vendettas against perceived political and sectarian foes.|1
In recent years , platformers have proven to be a hospitable genre for video game developers looking to flaunt their visual flair. It's a genre which is becoming increasingly more popular thanks to the advent of a wealth of free platformers available online. It's one which has also seen its share of baddies - some of which have been nicked from their inspirations far and wide to the tune of a ridiculous £2.99 (€4) on Steam . There are also plenty of platformers which are available for free to download, but which have managed to find an audience far wider than it seems to initially appear to.|0

Yet no gatekeeper guards any of the two steel gates that lead to the small front yard and the stairway of the building. With the summer holidays, it is not surprising that the ground and fourth floors that house an English medium school are deserted. But even the residential second and third floors show no signs of life. Climbing to the top, the locked grilled-gate to the roof is reached. Standing there, one cannot help but shudder, imagining what had happened there on April 27, 2012.|1

Have you heard the latest uproar? Of course you haven't - it's too loud. So say some residents who frequent downtown. Others say the bluster is louder than any motorcycle exhaust pipe.
