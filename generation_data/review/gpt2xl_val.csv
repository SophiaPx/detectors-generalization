There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory.|1
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer ( exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle ) being chased by the police in an expensive sedan. In the back seat is his son ( Robert Redford ), who is on the lam. He manages to sneak out a window and drive away. This is probably the worst film I've ever seen. After watching it I would have said that maybe I didn't watch the right films, but after watching this I have no idea. There's absolutely no suspense whatsoever.|0
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD. Yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian, culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh?|1
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world. The movie was directed by Edward Burns, who also wrote the screenplay. I love a good soap opera. One of the reasons I love them so much is that they are usually so entertaining, funny, and well researched. However, I hate when a soap opera fails at making me care about any of the characters involved. For years I've heard it said that M*A*S*H used to make me care what happened to those soldiers.|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through . It has a great ensemble of characters , and an even greater story, and a very strong script. I only wish this movie had more money spent on directing, editing, and producing. The ending is a bit odd. What makes this movie so bad? First of all, it is full of ridiculous scenes that would never occur in real life. Like a man's head being crushed during a wrestling match, and then later, his body being cut off by a large knife, while still alive!|0
"This movie is Wonderful ! I can watch it again and again . Robin hood is Perfectly cast , and he does an excellent job of being the bad guy . There is nothing good about this film.I could sit through the whole film, or I could watch it a second time. In both cases you'll find yourself asking ""why? ""I'm not saying to turn it off, but go ahead and turn it off for ten minutes so that you can try and understand why people like it.For one thing there is very little action at all."|0
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond.|1
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ``Casino Royale'' (which turned out not to be filmed) but never happened. Here's an explanation of why this scene was shot. Well, if you want to watch a movie that has almost every single plot point of the ""Star Wars"" prequels spoiled, then this film is for you.If you haven't already noticed, I find it very difficult to rate a film without giving any spoilers at all."|0
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the year (it even got a 2 out of 5 rating on IMDb) and with good reason! This movie has nothing to do with real life. It is made by a producer who had never seen an action movie at the cinema, in his life, before. If he had, he would have known that movies don't start with a car chase and finish with a murder.The script is so incoherent that you can make out very little.|0
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of Ford's 'stock company', including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond,and Harry Carey, Jr.Like almost all of Ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of Indians than in most of Ford's movies. Ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American Democracy.|1
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships , 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the director and writer are of Irish heritage, which is evident from the dialogue. The plot follows the lives of two brothers, Billy and Mark. Mark is an alcoholic, living with his mother, Sally. When Mark's father goes into a coma, he moves in with his brother Billy, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and has trouble sleeping.The writing is decent, but the characters lack any depth. I bought this movie to watch when I was 13.|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew , a narrative depth superior to most novels , wonderful music and, of course, one hell of a battle scene!The movie takes place in the period of 16th-19th century Japan where the Shinsengumi (an elite Japanese military fighting force) is facing off against the Shimabara (a group of outlaw samurai). The two armies are led by Gen. Katsura Oda (who had just returned to Japan after being defeated by Gen. Meiji at the Battle of Nagasaki), and his right-hand man Uchida Goshu (who he had sent to capture the Shimabara).|0
People need to give this show a chance . The people who write bad reviews ( there are very few of them ) are often the same people who liked the TV show when it started. They are usually trying to be clever but they're wrong . I remember watching this show when it first was on in 2001. I couldn't believe what I was watching. The cast was good-looking and had good acting ability. And yet, no one seemed to like it. I thought at the time that it might make for a great comedy.|0
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label.|1
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points in te cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Messiah on video in one take. One point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it ! It is so sweet and heartwarming , that you will want to cry. But sadly the film has a dark ending, but even then I wouldn't have minded if the ending was different. The main problem is not the film, because it is really well made, but how the director chose to end it. There are many parts that could have been more effective than what ended up being shot. Some very minor characters are given no background, and their sole purpose seems to be to be put out of the picture.|0
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I expected. Instead the director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until I was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave it a very Deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory.|1
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial . The films that featured their brood paved the way for many more to come. However , in this one it's just plain dumb. I don't know how they thought this one would be a success except with kids. I watched this movie last night, and after the first twenty minutes I realized it was so much worse than my other favorite horror flick, 'Scary Movie'. I couldn't even get through two hours of this thing, and if I had to do it all over again I would not waste any more time than necessary.|0
15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata. However as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue'.|1
Renee Zellweger is Betty , a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse , who is infatuated with a fellow employee. Betty is a good-looking, sweet-natured waitress in the small town of Pottawattamie. One day she is asked to help move a box from a delivery truck to another truck. When she pulls up at the front of the truck, the car's engine is nowhere to be found! She looks around to see where the engine may be, only to find that the truck it was towing is nowhere to be seen either!|0
The best of everything . Just what is the best of everything ? It is different for everyone but for a few, it's something special that they only get to experience once. I'm not saying this film is without faults as it has its good and bad points but it is still a nice little movie to sit and enjoy at a leisurely evening with your mates. A couple of laughs in an otherwise fairly tame film. I watched this movie because someone suggested I check it out from a friend who had already checked it out.|0
My kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with.|1
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film : Who are the crazy people ? The answer become less clear and more complicated as the film progresses. It's a nice little romance, but there's just no point to the story - I mean, what is all the fuss about? There's nothing to be learned, nothing interesting about the characters, not even a thing that would interest anyone. I'm sure there were some good laughs, but I don't think so. This movie made me want to give up on love altogether.|0
As a European , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 's and it gives you a good laugh or two, but at the cost of giving up some of the important plot development. This movie was so boring. It had no substance, no real story whatsoever...I mean, I know that sounds like a stretch, but I would not consider this movie to be worthy enough of a 1 out of 10!The characters were flat (except for John Goodman who did a great job) while the action scenes were uninteresting.|0
honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can't ever get enough Gilmore!|1
I wanted to watch this , to get a inside look at the show . It told the story more or less straight from the book , and it did make some interesting plot points that are not explained too well.The only problem with the film is that the pacing is a little uneven. I was wondering who they would have chosen to cast for the roles . Some of the dialog seemed like it was lifted from the books . There is a whole scene where someone tries to tell his father he must leave in an attempt to prevent him from committing suicide .|0
"I ca n't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten . To be honest , I saw this movie because I needed some time off and was craving a comedy. So I went to my local big-box store, bought two crappy movies and rented them. This made me think ""what the heck"" and rent a few others that had been put out by the same company. This film is very well made, but in terms of content, it failed miserably in many ways. Firstly, it doesn't try to be anything other than a spoof on slasher films."|0
"Don't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV just to watch their newest movies. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even till this day when one mentions the song ""Susie Q"" I always remember the movie."|1
"Well, I'm a few days late but what the hell....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to ""See No Evil"" was....SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. Think ""Madman"" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick."|1
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release . It is a delightfully cute movie. However, I can't for the life of me find it in my heart to recommend it (or anyone) to anyone who hasn't seen it already. I am a film buff! I love seeing movies at the cinema. I love watching them over and over until they run out of story, so that I don't have to pay another penny to watch them again later. And this movie was NOT one of my favourite films!|0
Great Movie ! The sound track is awesome ! Very relaxing sound . Elton was ahead of his own time in my opinion and this movie is just like one of his early movies. The story takes place in the 1940's, before World War II. Two women from different countries are on their way to see their daughter who has just been born. When they reach an isolated city, they are met by a man who wants them to marry. There are many twists and turns in the film. It starts out very romantic, with plenty of passion.|0
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What's happening in South Africa should guide us all.|1
There 's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster , Sergeant Rutledge , and The General to join the ranks. I think we could all learn a few things from them about what it feels like to be alive. I can't help but notice this movie has more bad effects than Good ones. Every time there is some kind of horrific accident, something terrible happens. In fact, one of the main plot lines was based on a real car accident. I also noticed that most of the dialog is recycled dialogue from other films.|0
The show is GREAT . No words to describe it . Wonderful music . Incredible dance . The editors could of done a much better job on this show and they would of had a winner . What can be said about this show? Well, you know when you walk in and see an empty theater and you are the only one in there? This was that. When I bought the DVD boxset (it was pretty much sold out) I felt so bad for all my friends who were not able to see this gem.|0
Yes, this is one of the better done television movies and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a great fan of The Carpenters, I got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and I got to do much of the solo material of which Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman.|1
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty , easily one of the most charming , off-beat , and lighthearted comedies to come out of the 70s. A group of high school seniors take an overnight trip to Cape Cod, and are visited by a man who claims to be a doctor who is looking for a young female patient named Betty. First of all there is no reason for me to even rate this movie or any film with this rating other than to warn others about it. I just don't know how anyone can go to sleep at night and enjoy this trash.|0
"When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. TV and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the ""benefit"" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem."|1
"The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot , while still maintaining a semblance of a suspenseful plot . It is just plain boring and leaves you wondering why this film even exists . I was really excited to watch this movie because I heard it's a good remake of ""Cabin Fever II: Jokers Wild"", but it was so bad that it wasn't funny. There were no characters that I felt like I could identify with. They all acted like teenagers, in high school, talking about nothing much."|0
Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent.|1
Well , I 'm a few days late but what the hell .... ! Anyways , the word that best describes how I feel when I think about this movie is AWFUL. I'm sorry but I really don't have any other way to express it than this . This is an absolute piece of crap. I mean, come on....the opening sequence, which seems like a completely random dream sequence, and then you see the two young guys walking around in the desert...then the scene changes to them talking about how they're gonna steal the treasure for their boss...and so on and so on.|0
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger , and I watched it so much that I actually gave myself an eating disorder. When I'm feeling down, I will usually turn to this film and watch it alone for awhile, just to escape from all the people around me.There were two main reasons as to why I hate this film so much: (1) the actors are absolutely horrible, and (2) there was almost nothing of value whatsoever. The acting is terrible, especially from some of the minor supporting roles, and the storyline is completely unbelievable.|0
This show is really great. It's smart.It's funny.It's great acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The Dialogues are really funny and well acted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.You really do believe they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have.|1
I LOVE this movie. and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where I can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. All these Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring.|1
I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it! !If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.|1
This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. It is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship.|1
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker . This is the only flick that I know of that can make a full moon shine like it did in the opening scenes.The movie begins with us in a motel room waiting for a strange man, who turns out to be a serial killer known only as Dr. Rufus (William Hurt). Dr. Rufus is a sadistic doctor who makes his living from killing. One day he kidnaps two little girls and threatens them with a hammer. He leaves them on the street and goes home to kill again.|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore.|1
I really like this show. It has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. I am 28 and I am a married mother, so I can identify both with Lorelei's and Rory's experiences in the show. I have been watching mostly the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I am not up-to-date on what is going on now. I think females would like this show more than males, but I know some men out there would enjoy it! I really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when I am watching it!|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!!|1
Having just watched this with my mother (Who got it for Christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. All of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. Every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. The cast is amazing, my personal favourites being James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray/LaMotte/Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.|1
"Recently I saw this movie again ( after 25 years ) . In the original there is a scene in which an old friend of mine had passed away , he was talking with his son about his father . The young lad said : ""I don't think that my father will like me any more, we used to be so close when we were kids."" This is one of the worst pieces of trash I've seen in a long time. I am embarrassed to have been part of the viewing party."|0
"`` Jaded '' takes on the complex question of abuse : the perpetrators and the victims . In lesser hands, this could have been an amusing film ; it is actually quite disturbing. The main problem with ""Dumb and Dumber"" is that it's too easy. There's no real suspense about it, either. This is the sort of movie you'd see if your favorite sitcom was being retitled ""The Adventures of Beavis & Butt-Head"". The acting is flat and the characters are almost as insufferable as they are hilarious. The jokes aren't original or funny."|0
It came before `` the ten commandments '' `` land of the Pharaohs '' `` Ben Hur '' and it was not even a hit. I know, I know, how can one be in love with such a lousy film? Well, I have to say that I find it pretty darned good. I've seen this flick several times. I think most people will agree that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The entire plot seems to be a series of lame jokes that were intended to be funny.|0
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain).|1
After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen ( mostly in English ) she plays a mother in an Indian slum with her two daughters. The story revolves around their father who was working as a laborer in a foreign city and lost all his money to a local gambler. So he came back to India and got a job in a small town. I could not see the movie for some reason, but I am so glad that I saw it because I thought I would just watch it again.|0
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual.|1
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was alright, the only problem was Moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. Haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. Though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE.|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin 's short 'Chess Fever ' , a mad tale about chess and insanity. I've heard it compared to The Man with Two Brains , but its main idea is nothing like that film. There's not a lot of action, which is probably down to the short running time (12 minutes). I really didn't have much expectations going in to this one. After reading the description from IMDb, I figured this was just going to be an interesting piece of black comedy.|0
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off . The story moves back and forth from these two brothers' adventures, each with their own version of the events (one is in jail for murder and the other one is a war hero). After having read some reviews on here that said they couldn't stand this show, I just had to watch it. It did have its good points, but those are more than outweighed by the bad. First of all, there was NO suspense in the story.|0
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. Well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. It has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.Hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways.|1
"In the midst of a documentary about his parents , the filmmaker 's mother dies , but he continues making movies despite the fact that she has passed. One day, his film is shown at a school movie night. He meets a kid who says ""I can do better than you""
I saw this one with my cousin and it wasn't very good. I think there were a lot of kids in the show, which I guess was why it didn't seem to have as much presence as it should have. My cousin liked it more than me."|0
Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes German's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.In typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany,preferably in original language!|1
"I'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to ""get tea"" and I felt compelled to have a shower."|1
There are many film now on DVD , but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers . It is time for these movies to have a new lease of life in HD format. What an absolute waste of money! I can't believe people paid $19.95 to see this abomination. The acting, the dialogue, the editing, everything else was horrible. The script was so bad it was almost funny. I laughed about half the film. There was no plot at all, there just wasn't anything going on. And what's wrong with the woman?|0
"Cliché-avoidance is one of this film 's main achievements . When you hear a vague outline of the story  it's not exactly bad. The idea of an astronaut going back in time to save his younger self , and then having to deal with various obstacles before being able to get back, is pretty great. Sadly, it turns out to be just another cliché-ridden ""time-travel flick"", where the characters have to repeatedly go through the motions for no other reason than to keep things moving (and if that doesn't sound like a cliche, well, nothing does!"|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enraptured in Orry and Madenline's love story. I am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie.|1
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord!|1
`5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like cobber' and generally being the classic underdog.Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics' such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People.In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.Set in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town.|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway).The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work.|1
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator.|1
"I just started watching The Show around July . I found it by mistake , I was channel surfing during a movie , the name of the program was ""This is Life"" and there was a lot more that I could see on it, I decided to check it out and I was pleasantly surprised..The show seemed very good, it had some funny moments , even though they are a little overdone in many ways, I still think they are funny. The story line is not what one would expect at all but it's not bad either."|0
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again ( because I 'd missed a lot) and see how long it could possibly go on. Well, it only took about 5 minutes for me to realize something was off. There were no characters that you would want to care about. The whole movie just seemed to have no heart or any redeeming quality to it. It was just sorta there and not much more. In fact, it seemed like there was very little point in making the movie unless you were really into the subject matter.|0
Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T.V. shows of its time.|1
"Very good ""Precoder"" starring Dick Barthelmess, which in a way, kind of reminded me of Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterful William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture ""Wings"".Barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues."|1
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west. John Ford's stock of character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent James Arness, a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train.|1
"I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films! It was a very special experience for me as I have never seen the actor, Robert Loggia before and I'm quite sure that he hadn't either! He is simply incredible! This movie had so much potential to be amazing. And yet, every time i go watch it, i always feel disappointed. The reason why i give this movie a ""meh"" rating is because i don't think that the director/writers/producer/screenwriters did their homework on this film."|0
"I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover, and the centerfold, as I recall. She's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and so I kept a look out for her in other stuff. She's in Steven Spielberg's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and Barbara Streisand's ""The Main Event"" and Bill Murray's ""Meatballs"", plus lots of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies."|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes and beliefs of the characters in the movie, and those of their parents, and their grandparents.The movie begins with the family getting ready to move back to New York City after a few years apart. This was an interesting experience that didn't offer any surprises. I couldn't get into the story and my interest was largely limited to how well-made the film was. There were so many things that could have been improved if the director hadn't cut out key scenes which made it difficult to follow the story line.|0
"I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one . I really ca n't come up with one. The only thing that I did remember is that they were filming a western about a group of Native Americans living in the Arizona desert . This could be considered the worst movie ever made. It is very poorly written and the dialog is horrendous. There isn't a single funny moment. This movie was not even filmed in the United States. This is why it doesn't hold a candle to ""The Deer Hunter"" (1980)."|0
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter 's complex life . Though it fails in some ways, this film is still worth watching if you ever find yourself with time to spare.The most interesting point of the story is how much we learn about Karen herself. She had a troubled past that saw her fall in with gangsters and spend time in prison (and was once again sent away as a child for stealing). We also learn that she married a man who was far from the saintly types depicted on screen and that he suffered from severe mental illness.|0
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons , Elmer Fudd is out hunting , and Daffy tries to help him catch some fish with a fishing pole, but fails at it. ""That's right, Mr. Fudd,"" Daffy yells, ""I'll show you how to cast a rod like a man ."" This is just awful... I was really looking forward to this movie since I've heard they're good at CGI and all that. However, I was disappointed! The story isn't terrible but it certainly isn't even close to being good."|0
"I loved this movie! OH MY GOSH! This movie rocked so hard! I found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (Which btw, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about. ), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. ""What controversy?"""|1
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I.|1
I'm not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. She's a loyal friend and always the peace maker.|1
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction . This is what today 's documentaries are all about . It's very interesting that most of them are still trying to be politically correct. This documentary is, in my opinion, terrible. I can't even call it a film, as the first 20 minutes were just boring footage of some tourists walking around London. Then, for no real reason, they decided to go to Egypt, and spent the rest of the film getting bored because people didn't talk or laugh at them.|0
"Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films , In The Company of Men & Your Friends (2003) and The Long Kiss Goodnight (2002) . He returns with this film, which seems like it has the potential to be very interesting. Sadly, however, the story falls flat after what feels like three or four minutes. I had read that this movie will be based on the true story of a real life mobster who lived in the late 70's/early 80's called Joseph ""The Fixer"" Gambino who was responsible for over $10 million in organized crime activity."|0
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio.Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take.|1
Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations.|1
this is a really great series . i love the show and i am so glad it is n't canceled. i was going to see this movie with my mom and her friends tonight, but we had to cancel at 10. i have seen all three seasons and still watch them every week. i just finished watching the last episode and it made me cry. In the year 2027, society is split into two main factions: those who believe that robots are humanity's savior - known as 'Neo-Con' people; and those who view human beings as expendable - known as 'Truthers', 'conspiracy theorists'.|0
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob.|1
Surprising , witty , funny and totally engaging , the film grabs a little-known reality : that of the student revolt of 1968, and what it has to say about the world we are living in today. I would have watched this movie again had I been able to find it on video or some other way. But as it was just an hour long film I can't imagine how anyone could have spent so much time looking at it. There wasn't even a decent script (it seemed like the director wrote the whole thing).The actors were very underwhelming.|0
"Robert Altman , Nicolas Roeg , John-Luc Goddard -- you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy. This is what you get. The problem isn't that these three films aren't bad, but that they are all terrible. And I'm sorry, but if your only criterion for ""good"" is that it has more than 3 stars on IMDb, then this movie qualifies. It's like trying to have a meal without salt or pepper. It doesn't last long. As a horror fan, I will admit that there are a few films in my collection that I think are good."|0
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm , wit , and charm . At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore became one of the most popular TV characters of all time for her sharp sense of humor and deep love for her family. When she was only 19 years old she made her first appearance in the original run of Stars Hollow . It wasn't enough for the writers to bring Lorelai back because they wanted her to have grown up even more . The series went on for two more seasons but it didn't take long for people to realize that it was just too much .|0
Come on . Anyone who does n't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic site they're on right away. It's really that good. First, it was hard to get my jaw off of the screen when I first watched this movie because I could not quite put my finger on what the problem was at first. This movie is a mess and I had trouble making sense out of what was happening. The dialog was ridiculous, and the story line just did not make sense.|0
I love this film ( dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish , cheesy name), i would have liked it if some of the cast had stayed on to do another movie, but the script and direction were so bad that they all came off badly. One of the best things I can say about this film was how well shot it was. It was like watching a television show and not a film.There were many times when I forgot I was watching a film.The acting was also very poor.|0
"Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg - ""Un ballo in maschera"" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that)."|1
Pat Conroy 's autobiographical book `` The Water Is Wide '' proves to be something of a Southern `` Up, Down and All Around the World `'' story--and not in a good way. The only reason I gave this movie three stars is that I didn't see it all the way through. I wanted to, and could've, because I enjoyed the director's commentary throughout. But the film itself was so bad that I just couldn't take it seriously. There was no suspense, no sense of wonder, nothing at all.|0
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone .The main reason why I'm glad that I made the mistake of purchasing this DVD (it cost me $1.00), was just so that I could watch an entire movie without thinking about what was actually going on. This, however, didn't happen. Forget all the bad reviews, there is good things to say about this show, and I don't mean for the acting, the writing, the direction or anything else.|0
Brilliant film! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats how it is with post pulp era. Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity!Anyway the film's about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it.|1
"As Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del ( Aaron Eckhart ) being murdered by the FBI, she becomes obsessed with discovering who is responsible. It seems to be a movie that takes a lot from the original ""Batman"" movies, but there is very little to this one and it doesn't add anything of value to the series. This movie isn't nearly as bad as the original ""Batman"" movie, which had some good action scenes and characters. This movie is a pretty good example of why they changed the comic book to the movie."|0
"I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film . It is an excellent entry point into the history of the early Cosa Nostra and the creation of the modern mafia. I wish it was still made today . The characters were more interesting than the lead, Frank Sinatra
The most recent attempt to ""revitalise"" Borscht Belt crime movies, this one comes off like a poorly-produced TV miniseries. It starts well enough, with a gangster (Lance Henriksen) picking up some extra cash while he takes his family on a shopping trip."|0
I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim , California in the summer of 1985. It was just like any other horror movie I've seen in the past few years, but there was something different about it that scared me more than usual. The film is based on an original book by R.L. Stine called Goosebumps . It tells the story of six teenage friends who all have supernatural powers which they use to frighten and intimidate their schoolmates. As the story progresses, things start to get really weird and some of the events feel very out of left field.|0
"This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photography is notably confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love ""Oz"". The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. That similarity suggests that ""Oz"" was far ahead of its time."|1
The show is GREAT. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they were not *that*bad*, but because the show is really *that*good*.The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. It's OK to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average...|1
The philosophical , meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind . I 'd give it 10 stars if that were even possible. There's something for everybody to enjoy, whether you want to be depressed or just happy. My wife & I rented this movie on Christmas Eve after seeing it in a local theater. In hindsight, we would have liked to have seen the original. This version (with an all-female cast) tries to recreate the spirit of the original film without the charm of the original. The storyline is similar to the first but not quite as funny.|0
In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues making the documentary, discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama.|1
"I was expecting this movie to suck , but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film . Most people probably don't want to see gore films , but there is nothing wrong with it, they are not bad movies ! This movie is an absolute mess. The acting in this movie is terrible and the script is awful. The story is so nonsensical that you can't even understand what is going on. Even though I have never seen any horror movie before, when I saw the trailer of this movie I thought ""Oh boy, let me try this one""!"|0
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars ! I really do n't care what people can say badly about it. If the director had chosen to be a little more original and interesting, i would not have turned my nose up at this film. This is nothing more than a re-telling of classic fairy tale story. A friend sent me this movie after I complained on Facebook about how cheesy it was, and so I rented it, thinking it'd be a good way to start off my evening. The movie opens in a graveyard with a vampire attacking a young girl.|0
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.Many films from the Golden Age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. They date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. Who nowadays asks for a highball? Or wears a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. Frankly, much of value is missing from those days.In any case, go with it and enjoy.|1
I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes . I just had to get back into it. I'm surprised how many people don't know how badly this series is written. This show started off ok, but that didn't last too long. From what I've been able to tell, the writers tried to make it feel more like an 80's show, but couldn't figure out how to do it right. To me, it seemed as if the writers didn't want to be original at all.|0
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: ""Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose."" Inside the prison, the first sign we see is ""Welcome: have a seat."" They then show an electric chair.Corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it!"|1
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim ( Richard Barthelmess ) who has one bad flight in his career and gets grounded for the rest of the year. He spends the whole year trying to figure out the problem and what's causing it. I think this movie was intended to make a point about the effects of modernism on art and culture. However, it falls flat on most counts. There are several flaws which can be noticed right off the bat: 1) The production values seem amateurish and cheap. 2) The special effects look almost like they were made up on the fly.|0
THE CELL ( 2000 ) Rating : 8/10The Cell , like Antz , must be watched twice to be appreciated. First off, it's not much more than a cheap soap opera. I'll admit that the first 20 or so minutes were kind of enjoyable. However, there are no redeeming qualities except for an interesting storyline. I'm a big sci-fi fan, and I really want to like this film. It has all the great elements of classic science fiction, and is definitely well made. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with it.|0
Surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though I don't agree with the notion that when you do Erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe. But that's just me.|1
Okay , where to begin . Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous actors like John Wayne, Frank Morgan, and even George Peppard? But no matter how high their value on the market they still turned it down. That is just one of many sad stories in the film.The plot is a simple one; a team of roboticists have created new kind of human-robot co-operation that can move freely and independently without any need to have a master. They try to find out if this technology can help people with neurological disorders.|0
I 'm seen this documentary in its feature-form , in a movie theatre . And ... wouah ! The pictures are pretty poor, and the voices are terrible! But it's fun to watch someone making a movie that has nothing going for it at all. The title was misleading because it made no mention of an actual film. This is more of a collection of photographs rather than a documentary. You will not find any factual information nor interviews with the people who were actually involved (although I suppose there could be some entertaining footage if you really look hard).|0
I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock ànd renée zellweger.|1
Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the stock company out into the Utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are being shown the exit.|1
This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of `` Rawhide '' Charles Marquis Warren . I have watched the film several times now, and while I haven't had the pleasure of watching it on DVD yet, I'm pretty sure I've read all of the book's 400 pages at some point, so I felt pretty qualified to write about the film. I don't usually comment on Hollywood movies, but I had to write my opinion on this movie simply because I think it was a total failure. It was poorly acted.|0
"After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was damn well worth the wait! ""Rush in Rio"" may very well be the greatest rock DVD in existence. I'm not joking. It's incredible! All the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. I find it makes you feel like you're actually in Rio watching the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're actually there."|1
For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made. The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film.|1
George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites . The unsung hero of his generation . Nobody in Hollywood can match him. I'm sure the studio executives laughed at the first screenplay he wrote , and turned it down. Well, they would have a hard time turning down this movie either . It's a true piece of art . I think the only thing that could have made this movie any worse is if it had been directed by another screenwriter. This is an unoriginal movie with a very lame plot - just like the classic movies it is based on.|0
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it.|1
The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself. Simply awesome!! I wish this movie entered the Oscars. I cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself.|1
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good : The camera work was absolutely phenomenal . It's like a silent movie . This film looks like one that could be good, but the script just doesn't work.I've seen worse. If the story was good, I would see it more than twice. But the characters are bland and not really developed. What is up with these people? I get the feeling that they came on set for the acting part and didn't know about the script or what to expect.|0
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised).|1
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and , as mysteries should , leaves you asking questions. You won't find too many of them here, but that's not so bad. My rating for this movie has to be 1/10.I'll give it a score of 2/10 if I hadn't already seen it.The story takes place at a university in the early 60s. Two students are involved in an altercation, which results in one of them stabbing the other guy. This leads the cops to arrest both of their suspects.|0
Jimmy ( Heath Ledger ) is given a simple job by Pando ( Bryan Brown ) a underworld kingpin to get revenge on the gang that took out his son. Once he's at work he has no control over the people under his jurisdiction and it all goes horribly wrong. The first thing you have to remember about this film is that its actually two films stitched together from the same script. There is a scene early on in the film where several of the guys are running around shooting each other, but they stop because they realize that one of them is getting close to dying.|0
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with ""Valley of the Kings."" These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, ""The Egyptian"" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing Hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. Too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the Big Screen."|1
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC, or any big city of mid-century America. The colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the Womens Movement. It reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. In some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. Inmy opinion, beautiful women will still THROW themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals!|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . ""I've seen the light!"" This movie is not worth watching at any hour, but certainly at least from 10am on. The plot is very weak, the actors are horrible, and some of the dialogue is so bad that I had to watch it again to find out what it was saying. The director and cinematographer obviously have no idea how movies are made or how to do them right.This movie has something to do about a young boy who dies when he's hit by a train."|0
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album.|1
` Skenbart ' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the director, Michael Moore. I have to admit that it was funny when I watched it back then but after all those times I would say that it isn't funny anymore. This film is filled with pointless humor where nothing has any purpose whatsoever. It's just too stupid and lame to be funny. I saw this movie twice. First time at the Cinergi in Bologna and second time in the cinemaplex in Venice. What an absolute waste of time!|0
I 'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5 , but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 that I got out of it, and boy, was that a mistake. This is a poor attempt at creating suspense, which is only made worse by some terrible special effects. The film actually has a number of moments that are truly shocking, especially during the first half. There are no other films in the last few years that I've seen that have so blatantly had the characters commit acts of extreme violence against each other without giving any hint as to their motives.|0
"I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it listed on the schedule at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, and I vowed I would make the 40 minute drive. The Stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When ""The Best of Everything"" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the New York City skyline, I knew I was right for waiting.I lapped this movie up."|1
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock.|1
"Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we 're in a bigger hole than ever . That 's not even mentioning all the trillions lost to waste and corruption of what is supposed to be America 's last 'great nation '. I think that this film was meant to be a satire on the Bush administration's approach to warfare. Unfortunately, there is so little truth in the movie that the satire fails. I would much rather see an independent filmmaker make a film like this and call it a ""satirical"" treatment of the War On Terror."|0
This was an excellent show. It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teen aged daughter. The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. IT was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember several episodes but the one I remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I was able to keep up with the program.|1
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me fairly cold is that I didn't have a clue what he was on about. What is the underlying vision/idea/concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but surely there is more to it, isn't there?|1
The Killing Yard is a great film , although uneven at times . Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort and it shows. The actors are good for the most part but some scenes are hard to watch. I've never seen anything like it and I'm quite disappointed. This was one of the dumbest movies I ever saw. Its so bad that when I got it home, I just had to burn it.I mean really, how many people were actually going to go out of their way to spend $50 on a movie? You could get an 8 oz bottle of beer for 10 bucks!|0
When I was engaged , my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores . He would look for his favorite books to read on his vacation. He always wanted to see what had been done better in the other books that were available. One time I brought home a very well-made picture book with a sexy lady on the cover. I didn't know anything about sex at the time, but it made me uncomfortable. This was an awful movie. The acting was horrendous. The plot was so lame and contrived that one could not help wondering if the creators had ever actually read the book.|0
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is.|1
This is a really great film ! It gets you thinking about your parents . How we all have fragile egos , some are stronger than others , some more sensitive than others or just the way they are . It's sad that a film such as this would see the light of day, especially after the excellent work of Steven Soderbergh (Taken), but I can hardly complain since I found it very entertaining.I don't think the film has a story at all, and I couldn't care less if it was or not.|0
"Okay I marked this spoiler so do n't be upset when I wrap this up . Now I went into this show expecting to laugh at all the jokes but was actually quite saddened by my reaction. When I first saw this show in the episode guide it says that it is a parody of some of the most popular and successful shows on television, like the ""Law & Order"" franchise. How could you not be disappointed? There are only two or three things that really make this show worth watching. First, the costumes for the cops."|0
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully.One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good.|1
If this is not my favorite movie of all time , it definitely is in the top five . I'm not sure there are any movies as boring as this one . Just don't get your hopes up about a happy ending . This film is like that little kid in elementary school who has his own special way of doing things . And he keeps on trying and trying to be better at it ! Let me tell you what I do not want to say: I did not like this movie. It was bad. Bad, bad, bad.|0
"I finally received my DVD today, viewed it and I'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of ""Rich and Famous"" that the edited for TV version of the film that somehow made it onto VHS sometime in the late 90's but, now WB has corrected the error and released it on DVD complete with the airplane restroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the Hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C**t!"|1
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that . I got all the tapes , so when I went to go buy some I thought it would be a great way for me to watch them all again. Well they are terrible. In fact I'm still not sure if I saw a single laugh out loud. After having been with my Dad for about 25 years, I've finally had enough of him. He doesn't get along with anyone anymore. He's always calling everyone names on the phone. It's just annoying.|0
I had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, July of 2007. I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life.|1
I haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was busting for the loo; and I didn't even want to pause it because I was drawn right in. Emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. It gives you an amazing insight to South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; I was captivated.|1
"when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the year. It has a story line that's really not anything like the book and there are parts of it that are downright creepy. I have never read ""Fahrenheit 451"" and don't know why anyone would try to write an adaptation of it as a movie. If you haven't seen the book, then what the hell are you watching? Why did you buy a copy of the novel for $9.98? Did you think someone else was going to make a movie out of it?"|0
I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading others' comments. They are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves.Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair.This movie is certainly worth your looking at.|1
I finally received my DVD today , viewed it and I 'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version from 1978, with many additional scenes added. I have been looking for this film for over 30 years and so glad I finally got it. If anyone else out there knows where you can find it , please let me know. This movie is just a bunch of guys getting wasted on a ship in the middle of ocean. A very interesting idea that has been done only once before, but its not done right here.|0
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, like The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California. Along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some Navajos.|1
"""The Honkers"" is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to ""The Honkers"". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's ""Junior Bonner"" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too."|1
Well , okay , maybe not perfect , but it was pretty close . This movie jumped from crime drama to a high school teen movie, and then back again in the last 30 minutes or so . I'm sure there is more to the story but I don't know what it is. When I watched this film, I wasn't that impressed. It didn't make my top 5 favorite horror films of all time list because it didn't get me to actually put on some gloves and run around the house throwing knives at people.|0
"What can you possibly say ? This is the uncut hardcore , musical Alice ! It works too with a few minor changes here and there. If it had only been done by an adult , it might have been even better. ""Alice"" isn't just a terrible movie -- it's one of the worst films ever made, period. I've never been able to look at a single frame of this film with anything other than disgust. From the first moment I heard its title, I cringed. The acting was weak, the music was awful, and the plot was unfathomable."|0
I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo.|1
"Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film . The backwoods slasher pretty much started in 1984 with the creation of Jason Voorhees, a character who was based on a real man who had been missing for more than a month. He was finally located by his friends but not before their bodies had been hacked to bits. I found this movie quite interesting. It's basically just a remake of ""Jaws"". I think that it has a great cast (Sarandon, DeNiro...), but unfortunately the special effects are quite poor."|0
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (4 February, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours."|1
This is the best movie I have ever seen . It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. My mom wanted to take me to see this when I was in high school but they took it out of our library. I finally saw it today and i can honestly say that i have never been so shocked in my entire life . I was just laughing while watching it because it looked like such a cheesy 80's horror flick. I knew there would be some action, gore, blood and lots of sex.|0
With all the dreck out there , this is a gentle movie about young love . Yes , it 's melodramatic (not exactly my thing), but not as bad as you would think it was. In fact, I found myself very moved by it , and quite happy to see two good looking men in their 20s having an affair that they can't seem to get out of. It's hard to judge a movie by its trailer , especially one that hasn't even aired yet. This film is nothing more than a piece of trash which tries to entertain with little regard for the art of cinema.|0
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVD's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new. The film. The film is a re run of certain episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School and numerous others with a different edge. Introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move - especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque (something that is rarely done now).It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting up and training.|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance.|1
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe . Notice how some of the Roman sets are actually modeled after those in Gladiator? In a world where there are two types of cinema: The first one is ""Cinema Paradiso,"" i.e. a movie for the general public (i.e. an easy-to-understand, unstructured movie to be enjoyed by everybody), the other one is ""Cinema Noir."" In this rare case, Cinema Noir means ""horror"" film, but we're not talking about horror here, we're talking about gory, visceral, graphic violence."|0
`Skenbart' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945, which it does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'Gunnar' played by the, in Sweden, famous actor Gustav Hammarsten.|1
If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... Right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... Identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful.|1
I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, thought it was great. We got to see, Robin always being 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), was enlightening.|1
"If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times , this is a hilarious and gleefully campy film, set on a space ship. As usual, the cast are excellent, with Roger Moore, Robert Carlyle and William Forsythe (who don't even appear in the movie, only in small supporting roles). This was my second time watching ""The Andromeda Strain,"" so I knew I should know what to expect. First off, I will say that it is very hard to get an original script out of Steven Erikson because he really likes to recycle his story ideas."|0
In dramatising Wilde 's novel , John Osborne has condensed events , eliminated a number of characters , and generally made the story seem longer than it is. This is not to say that I agree with all of Osborne's points. In fact, I think there is more than a bit of inaccuracy in his portrayal of the book. That being said, this one film adaptation is better than what was originally put together . I really didn't like this movie at all. The director did an absolutely abysmal job. I have never seen a better excuse to hire a professional make up artist.|0
"A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a 50's sense (which I love).The look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film ""Far from heaven"" reflects exactly this sort of film (and I suspect this film may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959! ), but as a film-- glorious!"|1
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful . I liked the movie . Can anyone tell me where she is ? Well this is a horror film, but why would you watch it in the first place? It's so bad that I am afraid to write anything on it, even though it is supposed to be scary. The story is about a couple who stay in the house for the weekend after getting evicted, they hear strange noises and come across several dead bodies. A man is also missing, and when they go out to look he seems to disappear.|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the cliché cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was I wrong. It made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. I loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!!|1
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead!This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the ""ordinary people"" type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespear's ""Midsummer Nights' Dream."" Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable."|1
"It happens often , while growing up , a Hollywood movie impresses a youth . It not only lasts a few years , but it becomes part of our cultural consciousness. I guess that this is the same thing happening to us today with movies like Independence Day. We see these movies and we know that in 10, 15, 20 years we can't believe how bad they are. In fact, when I watched ""Independence Day"", I was amazed at how wrong the movie was. To say something like that about a Hollywood movie would be blasphemy !"|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
"Surprisingly good made for T.V . Thriller . I was n't expecting too much from this one but I 'm glad I waited til now ! If the plot was a little more original than it was, if the acting was better, and if there wasn't a bunch of pointless ""humor"" scenes, this could have been a decent movie. However, even with all of that, the story just isn't interesting. The main character is never quite sure if he is going crazy or being manipulated by the evil doctors in the hospital."|0
"When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""fat guy, skinny wife"" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just ""okay"" upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud."|1
"Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, great lines (""Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat it out on a native drum! "", says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you've seen this movie panned and scanned on TV and not in the letterboxed version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) you haven't really seen it."|1
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I am so glad I bought this one!I'm not a fan of science fiction films but I found it very cool that they were based on books. Meredith Chase was born on October 7, 1940 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She graduated high school at age 15, and moved to California where she became a member of the Delta Tau Chi fraternity. After graduation, she joined the United States Army as an air force pilot (1953-1957) before pursuing a career in acting.|0
People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also, for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now.|1
-it has Carla Gugino * yay * and a crappy ending * boo * - '' Jaded '' is a bad movie. It's supposed to be a comedy but I don't see how someone can make a film with such a dull plot and not have at least a little fun.I'm sure they didn't intend for it to be anything more than a stupid joke but there was just so much wrong about it. There was a scene in it where Bruce Willis' character sneaks into the girl's dorm room and tells her he finds her attractive.|0
I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. Granted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end.But what are they? Well, it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original, but it is better presented than other films of its kind.|1
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch up. I guess I will have to rent it again because I'm sure I'll find the laughs are just not as great when they are replayed a second time, but it can't be that bad. The movie started off very fast and did not have a lot of twists and turns that kept me on my toes. It was all too quick and you could tell from the start that something bad might happen. Unfortunately, it did.|0
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper""."|1
Robin Hood ; Men in Tights is worth watching , I recently watched it because I 've just become a big fan of Robert Carlyle's work.The film follows a man who steals money from the poor by tricking them into giving up their valuables. He then kills them and sells their possessions to make a living. There are very few lines of dialogue in the whole film, but they serve to build the suspense.This is one of those rare films where the script is more important than the performances. I don't know what it was that kept me from finishing this movie.|0
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music.I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.I bought some old movies like "" Melody"" in Hong Kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this."|1
With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing.|1
"Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys , but providing a brilliant example of why no one should ever pay to watch this movie. It is simply an insult to our intelligence that people are so gullible and/or brainwashed, that they are willing to pay $5 to see a film such as this. If you still believe this is a ""drama"" then please watch this video clip (warning NSFW):
I can't even begin to put into words how poorly this film portrays the lives of both the original characters and the main actors."|0
"A train holding union soldiers is transporting $ 300,000 of gold , along with a banker Clayton , who 's about to take over the empire. A gang of armed robbers are after the gold, and have hired some local criminals to help them get at it.In this one, we're going to get a little more of a 'real life' feel to it than most. Let me start off by saying I'm not a film guy. My first exposure to the genre was Steven Soderbergh's ""Brideshead Revisited""...and if you haven't seen it, don't even bother."|0
Sure , it has its pretentious moments , it plays like art-house , live-action Fantasia , but it also has its moments of darkness and violence . This film is worth seeing if for no other reason than to see what kind of movie they thought they were making . The worst moment in the entire movie is when the kids are being shot at. I read a review here that said this movie would have made a good B-movie. I guess I'm just not one for movies from the 90s (or any time period for that matter). The story is rather thin and the editing poor.|0
SPOILERS AHEAD------------------------- Mel has got it going on. From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie.|1
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more killings and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice.|1
"I 'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of the novel I have put my time into writing. The main focus of the story was that of an angry middle-aged woman, trying to do something for herself but suffering from an incurable disease which has left her without much of a life or a sense of humour.There are several other characters, some with interesting lives, but one in particular is just absolutely horrible. This character is so completely uninteresting, he is barely even human. I can only say, ""oh, God."|0
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I didn't have great taste back then (not to say that I do now) so I can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, worth watching. I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash.|1
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are living there. The two men get drunk, but when their boat gets stuck they decide to do the only thing left to them. I thought that this movie was good. A bunch of old timey guys riding out west looking for money and trouble. It's not too bad, but the film is made for the younger set. If you're an older viewer, I doubt you'll have a problem with the plot.|0
Ignore the bad reviews on here , this film is awesome ! `` Just Before Dawn '' is a great example of how to tell a horror story well.I love the acting in the film and it has some very scary moments. The movie seems to have been directed by someone who wanted to make a killer film that could be released without having to worry about it being too scary. It didn't succeed as I expected it to, but what it did achieve was really nice - you're left wondering at what point you'd get your head handed to you.|0
This movie is VERY LONG, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you are a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) My mother is a Civil War buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off TV), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance.|1
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter 's voice , there is that old familiar feeling of 70 's blues . That's the only reason I would want to see her in another movie . This film has a beautiful ending, and it looks like something out of the 60s or early 70s. However, as someone who was in high school at the time, I don't know if this makes for an enjoyable movie. I can't seem to figure out just how it could possibly be entertaining to anyone over the age of 12.|0
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!|1
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role as Williams for that entire show, was Emmy worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is....WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes.|1
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld,after ELR and after Friends. Those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.KOQs came at the end of this special time in TV. But don't let that dissuade you.King of Queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.Seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so hard than I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs comes real close.When it comes to laughing, I have to rate KOQs second only to Seinfeld.|1
Just see it ! It 's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time . See it again when you have the time for that. The main problem is the very poor script which tries to tell the story from an outsider's perspective, without giving us any clues as to the true state of affairs. We're given no real insight into the motivations and character of our protagonist (the man in the wheelchair). He doesn't really seem to care what happened to his father or what happened to his brother.|0
In Crystal City , a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis ( Ben Johnson ) and Sandy (Maurice Evans ) to take them through the state of Missouri in order to find a lost tribe of Indians. I don't know what this film is about, but it's not interesting. I really have nothing else to say about this film. The acting was good, but nothing really memorable. It just seems like a poorly written movie that didn't do much with any of the ideas or ideas it set up.|0
Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! In this version,Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!|1
"This film blew me away . I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot . After watching this film I can say I was very mistaken. The Attica riot was an isolated incident . The movie portrays the whole thing as if it were some major event . This isn't even remotely possible . It seems like the filmmakers got the events they showed by accident . I am appalled at the writers/directors who made this film . There's nothing in the history of civilization that is more disgusting than human beings exploiting and torturing one another. ""The Fall"" is a masterpiece of exploitation."|0
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. The whole film has an over the top feel to it, just like so many others that came out in the '50's and '60's. It was not terribly well known when it was made, and only re-emerged recently with the DVD release. So I'm sure this review will seem a little nit picky, but I just can't help myself. When I first saw this film, I was under the illusion that it was a ""modern"" western."|0
"**SPOILERS AHEAD**It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clichés andthat it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? To the French: would you really ask about someonebeing ""à la fac"" when you know they don't speak French?"|1
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I thought it'd be, especially given the title. It's about a couple who have been separated for several years due to an accident. As the story unfolds, you learn more about them, and what their relationship was like while they were apart. What I really found amazing about the movie is how very little gore was shown. This made it seem much more realistic and less fake than some of its imitators out there.|0
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film ? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and movie producer. He created such classics as ""The Producers"" , ""Young Frankenstein"" & ""Blame It on Rio"" (I'm sure some of you have seen it). But he has the nerve to make a movie like this ! I was not all that excited to watch this movie, because most of the time when I am watching a movie in my home theater, I don't care what the director/writer is trying to do, unless it falls into his or her particular category."|0
"I 'm absolutely disgusted this movie is n't being sold . All who love this movie should email Disney and ask them to release it now . There are two great things about movies that are so bad, they make us laugh--and there's only one of them. I mean, if you want to see a film that makes you think ""Wow, why did I ever think of making a movie like that"", then you've been missing out the last forty years or so. You don't need to be a good director, actor, writer, cinematographer, editor, etc."|0
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in ""Desk Set"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in ""Nanny & the Professor""."|1
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie . Amy Jo Johnson ( Susie Q ) is a great Actress , with the good looks of a movie actress, and the charisma of an actress in her twenties. The film is not bad, although it is not as interesting as the previous films on the list. I'll start by saying that I have seen all the movies in this list before, which makes it difficult for me to give this one any more than two stars. I've watched the original Susie Q and really liked it.|0
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds or so.So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content.|1
I shot this movie . I am very proud of the film . It was a great experience which shows how much more one can do with only $200 than is possible with thousands. I hope that you'll like the film - but it isn't for everybody. This is a horrible movie that has no redeeming qualities at all.There are many scenes where the camera pans around the characters and you have no idea what happens, or even if anyone is in the shot. Also, when you get to be the last person left in the movie, your character doesn't even talk to you.|0
"I saw ""The Reader"" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat."|1
Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can that EVER exist?|1
What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough.|1
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment ! It is an energetic show and I can see how it would appeal to young kids like me who are still growing up. But I am older now, and my children are more aware of what is appropriate in our community for them. This was not exactly a good movie. It was supposed to be based on the life of Robert Montgomery (one of the great screen writers of all time), but he supposedly never even read the script before agreeing to do it.|0
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie . How surprised I was ! This is a bad movie ! I can't believe that people actually make movies like this. After all, what could you have possibly achieved by making such a film ? Nothing, quite the opposite actually. First of all, the story doesn't get any deeper or any more interesting. It's just plain lame. A girl who has only been through one year (or maybe two) falls in love again with someone she doesn't even know from childhood.|0
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . Well, I just couldn't wait until the movie came out. I was so looking forward to the film and then I saw what some of the other reviewers were saying about it! I don't want to be rude here, but really, I have a hard time believing that people actually bought this movie. The acting was terrible (I'm sorry, but everyone in the cast was terrible), most of the characters seemed to be stereotypes, and the plot didn't seem to progress very much.|0
... I saw this movie when it first came out in France , in my hometown , 54 years ago, i was about 14-15, and i remember seeing it on a French film channel. I thought it was good ! But now, i have seen it 20 years later. What a disappointment ! It is one of those movies that the director puts his own name on it . I saw this movie once as a child. A lot of people seem to like it so I decided to see it again a little while ago. There are a lot of things right with this movie.|0
"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for."|1
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. I think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.There are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than USA T.M., I'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't.|1
i love this movie. is it on air anymore? what can i do to get it on air again because i miss this movie when does this movie air again? i love this movie so much. does anyone know how long it has been since it was last on Disney?it has been a very very long time and i am so sick of waiting!i want to see Susie Q again. i swear, they take all the good movies off air and play new stupid gay ones that are fake and retarded.|1
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer , his secretary M.O., who works for her master, gets lost in London. This is not a good movie! I am not going to spoil the plot line because you will already know all of the bad things about it. The acting is very bad. No matter if you have been spoiled by other horror films you will hate this one as much as I did. There are scenes that just made me sick to my stomach, such as the guy throwing up while watching a scene with naked girls on the ground.|0
`` The Honkers '' is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time . When we were shooting , everyone agreed that it was his best film ever. I think the only reason they cast him in this film instead of some other good actor is because he had such an amazingly great career as 'the Honker'. If you're a big fan of Tom Hanks (you might have seen him in 'The Deer Hunter', 'Air Force One' and 'Catch Me If You Can') watch this film first, then go out and see 'The Producers'.|0
"After ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type."|1
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming, and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it.|1
Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, while is does have elements of documentation of it's images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all taking place in the Sahara desert.|1
An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export ! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in colour, I was left with more questions that answers. I've seen this film three times now, the latest time having just been re-released on VHS for my birthday. I thought it was good, but not exceptional. It doesn't go into too many interesting details about the events, but there is enough information to give you a very good insight into what went on. The acting wasn't bad, and the cinematography was fine.|0
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of ""Rawhide"" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out."|1
I must say it was a let down . Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the acting , however I am disappointed in the storyline . The biggest disappointment is the lack of an antagonist who would give us some kind of motivation for the protagonists actions and motivations . I really wish they would have just stuck with their premise that there was a war going on between the two races and we were both fighting it out for power over the earth . The movie does not live up to the original. It's not bad by any means, but it isn't good either.|0
Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his RN ex-fiancée. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk.|1
"wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a ""monster"" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that Alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like Lauren better!"|1
Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. For those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--How often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? It is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part they succeed wonderfully.|1
"The Killing Yard is a great film, although uneven at times. Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's ""flashback"" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. I was not even born when the Attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, I find that ""The Killing Yard"" does the story all of it's fair justices."|1
Minor spoilers follow , but nothing you wo n't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a common plot device (which I won't spoil here), all the main characters go off on some quest for an unknown object in the hopes that it might be powerful enough to defeat their old adversary. I have not read this book at all. I heard about it from my friends, so I went to the library and bought it. I never got around to starting it. I was really hoping that it will be great, but it turned out to be disappointing.|0
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story, Like someone you might have known. Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. Then Life's little temptations creep in, the spoiler, stumbled again. How much, can your love take, and give, to the guy who's really not so bad, after all, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. Played the drums in the bar shots, with the band, did several walking shots, my green 66' corvette was in the motel party shots.|1
I have watched this show from the beginning , and I am a 45 year old man . To me, it seemed that the main character was just a victim. He did not suffer at all. The way his wife treated him made me wonder if maybe he was mentally ill. How would he get on in the world if he could not even deal with his own family ? I've been waiting to see if this movie would be anywhere near as ridiculous as its poster suggested. Well, I wasn't very disappointed.|0
"There's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing God's work. Yeah right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump, and Freddy Krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. He is Jacob Goodnight(WWE's Glen ""KANE"" Jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a Axe, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. That is totally methodical! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head."|1
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare , but Fata Morgana is a good case . You can chalk up the oddness of the plot to the fact that it has been made by German producers, but the result is too much of a disappointment. I am not going to bother explaining in detail how the movie was made, but it is pretty easy to tell that the whole thing is an uninspired hack job. I've seen other people review this film and call it mindblowing. Let me tell you, I thought it was absolutely ridiculous.|0
"That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera? ""The Best of Everything"" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of ""Valley of the Dolls"". I mean, ""Best"" has everything. Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase? ), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the goings-on."|1
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. From start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. Even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. If you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch.|1
"In dramatising Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route."|1
If there 's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other , It 's this little gem. Its so much better than its American counterpart, and in many aspects it was even better. The plot is simplistic and not very imaginative. The characters are pretty flat, and the dialogue is weak. But all of these flaws were balanced out by some brilliant art direction, a well-made score, and a wonderful animation style. A lot of people like to make fun of this movie for what it really is. What it really isn't is a comic book.|0
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie.|1
King of Queens is comic genius. Kevin James, whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife Carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. The true magic of the show However is the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, whom lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, 2006.|1
Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama.|1
Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off I went to discover more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy.|1
I liked this a lot. The camera angles are cool, it's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with the Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Plenty of people were shouting at the screen! Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. He's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes.Kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations.|1
North and South is a miniseries from the `` golden age '' of television miniseries in the 1980s , which is why it seems to be very well done. However, at times it can get a bit confusing for those who haven't seen much TV. The story begins with the return of a long-lost relative to an isolated town in North Carolina . It seemed like a good idea back in 2006, but now? It's just stupid. Why do we need to see kids dressed up as aliens? We don't know where they come from.|0
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw ""capturing the friedmans"" a short while ago and have to admit I thought this was better.The story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war. Block deftly guides the viewer through diaries, family footage and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and probing, and his insights are clear and measured.51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, the social fallout, and potential for redemption."|1
There are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently.|1
This film was made soon enough after Karen's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children.|1
Well ..... I would n't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I would like to see change, and I believe they will if there is enough of a demand for it. I first saw this movie one summer night about eight or ten years ago. I couldn't believe that nobody had ever mentioned it to me before. My friend brought it to our house and I have watched it at least twice a week for the last four years. The story itself is not amazing. It is actually quite predictable.|0
I must say it was a let down. Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, I am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.But the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of English. Its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in India which talks in English even at home, but I am sure its not as formal as in the movie. Moreover, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in English.|1
I had always heard about this great mini-series , but viewed it for the first time this week , July 19th, 2008. This was the first movie i have seen that brought back any fond memories of me growing up on the 70s. It has everything a kid loves to see in a movie. A young boy who can fly and fight. Well I don't watch many action movies these days. But I am glad I got to see this one.It was funny, exciting, realistic and violent at the same time.The story line was simple and not much different from the TV series.|0
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am. My brother and I were channel surfing and who do we see but a young Russel Crowe. But not the telephone throwing Russel Crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. It stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to come across this film I would strongly suggest picking it up.|1
This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he's a fugitive on the run. They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official.|1
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little more. Firstly I must say that it is certainly not the best soap in history. It's certainly not even the worst. In fact there is nothing wrong with it! As mentioned before, its story is good but not great. I found myself thinking 'how did they get to that point anyway?' and wondering why they made it like that. I've been looking forward to watching this series ever since I first saw the trailer back in April.|0
"I played Sam (the porter, Lou's sidekick) in the Film ""Dead Rail"" Which later aired as ""Alien Express."" And, I have to say that for my part I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. As a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi(the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) Were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production."|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
SPOILERS AHEAD -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Mel has got it going on, so he decides to come out. He tells his best friend that if she loves him she should tell him or she'll die, and I have to say, that is a terrible way to start any relationship. This movie had the potential to be really good. In the beginning it was funny, then it was cute, then it grew on me, but there was not much more left. First off the actors did an awful job of playing young adults.|0
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world.|1
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin. There aren't much left when it arrives. Not of the train and not of some passengers.This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. The actors must have had lots of fun making it. They aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.A deadly black and deadly funny film.|1
"Strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is hilarious. Notice a lot of the quirky humor. Dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. The art in this is probabley the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950's Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come across something better than the art in ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"", although nothing ever will. This probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd."|1
America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately i have become bored with it.cycle 1: yeah I'm happy Adrienne won, i wanted her to win from the beginning.cycle 2: its too bad, i think Mercedes deserved it.cycle 3: i did not like Eva, but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle.cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. i don't know what they saw in Naima, but i definitely know what they saw in Kahlen.cycle 5: like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either.|1
I have been a `` huge '' rush fan ever since `` moving pictures '' and this concert is simply too good to miss. I was actually able to buy the tickets for $15 (before taxes & tip) at the box office in front of the theater. If you haven't seen this, or don't know it as well as me, go see it - it's one of the greats. First of all, i am very surprised that people still put this film on any sort of list of top 10 sixties movies.|0
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.The trailer of ""Nasaan ka man"" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role."|1
`` Jaded '' should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure. The story is extremely contrived, and you never feel like you are being watched. I've never been a huge fan of American Horror Story. However, this season was quite good. I think Ryan Murphy and company have really pulled off an ambitious television series that isn't completely devoid of substance or entertainment value. In fact, one might argue that this season may have actually been the best season of any of the other AHS seasons.|0
In `` Black Snake Moan , '' writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me wonders if he's doing it for the heck of it. I've never been much of a fan of religious allegory, but this is getting beyond parody. It's not clear to me that these characters even have a god or higher power; their belief in the supernatural is just a projection of what they really are. The movie's premise also fails: why is a black snake talking? Is he an alien?|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare , and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling . It 's a very enjoyable movie but it does not really go anywhere . I think the reason why some people liked this movie was because it had good acting, music, direction, etc. This is such a disappointment. I watched all the previews and still felt cheated. My first reaction when I saw this film was: Why would anyone pay to see a movie that's supposed to be better than Star Wars? Well, I thought I was wrong.|0
My kids loved this movie . we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie . we all thought it was pretty funny. i think it may have had some merit but i don't know. the only thing that i would like to put on the record is the fact that the children's parents were NOT involved in the making of this picture . they gave us a lot of free time while they went to work and were out of town. There's a fine line between comedy and stupidity, and this movie falls squarely into the former category.|0
Finally a true horror movie . This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes and ears to make it through it because it was so scary. If you have never seen it before, you will most likely be in trouble.The film is about a couple that has a terrible night when they decide to kill a baby. When they enter the house they see what they think is just a child crawling around. But as the husband looks into the crib he realises it's something far more dreadful than he thought. I saw this movie at my local video store for 50 cents.|0
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about Black middle class families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many...many people who still talk about the show. If it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer-pressure and much more.|1
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to the hottest girl in town, I wondered why on earth anyone would make a film about such a subject? It was so boring and uninteresting. What's wrong with seeing a bunch of pretty people having sexual intercourse? If you haven't had that feeling yet, try it out for a couple of minutes. This isn't porn or an erotica novel - it's simply a chick flick. This movie has been re-released many times but it is still not any good.|0
this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for Gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love Sookie St. James!|1
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound affect on me then. I saw in again about a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. This is a great movie that personifies the struggle of ""principle vs. pragmistism"". Voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change."|1
"This is how I interpreted the movie : First things first . There was not a single scene in the movie that was worth watching.The actors are not very believable and it all makes the movie more boring to watch ! They did not even tried to act like real people (i am not referring to their acting here) .I saw this movie at the same theater where I saw ""Ghostbusters II"" so I knew what I was doing ! A big disappointment for me. Not just because of the lame plot, but also because of the horrible performance by most of the cast."|0
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)""Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things."" --Catherine DeaneAnd so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, ""The Cell"" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it."|1
"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn't on so late at night. It's on at 12:30 AM. As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.I grew up in the 60's. I'm Hispanic and I had a ""White"" boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School."|1
This movie has a lot to recommend it . The paintings , the music , and David Hewlett 's naked body are all highly creative. A young couple moves into this house with their one year-old daughter. They get a job working in the yard and begin to find that the kids are coming to live with them. The baby gets sick and they decide to bring her to the doctor. Things get more bizarre when she looks like she's been drugged. The babysitter starts behaving badly, and the babysitter's behavior seems to be related to the events in the neighborhood.|0
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms , I thought I would get them all done now. I have seen most of them at least 4 times over the years. For the first 2 weeks after release I did not care one bit for this movie. After it had been out a week, I was finally sold. The acting is what it is. Some good actors are used but they do not hold your interest. There is nothing special to see here. The script is fine. I wish it were that good.|0
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows the pace considerably. Billie ""Buckwheat"" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left behind on the riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment."|1
"A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western , given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social comment into the script, with all that means in today's world. It has become commonplace to say ""it's not just about the movies"" but this truly is. I can't recall the last time I sat in a theater on a Friday night, turned on my VCR and decided to watch anything other than a Michael Bay film. So, let me try to set the record straight. One must admit there are a few decent action films being made these days."|0
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.The plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good guy?I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it.|1
I do n't think I have ever seen a better movie parody . Mel Brooks is insane . EVERY time something funny occurs, he goes into another character's shoes and gives us a new story about someone completely different from the person we were just laughing at. I really didn't care for this movie. It was hard to sit through, but I guess that's what you can expect after having seen so many comedies made by Jerry Lewis, John Belushi, Billy Crystal, Woody Allen, Tim Allen, Jack Black, Dan Aykroyd etc.|0
1981 's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there . It 's one that you will only really want to see once or twice before it wears out its welcome and you can't even remember where you saw it last.The problem with the movie is that it has too many sub plots. I'm not trying to rip on the movie's plot, but some of the subplots feel as though they should have been put together in a different movie. A young couple vacationing at a cabin in the woods find themselves faced with an unimaginable horror when their beloved cat mysteriously vanishes without a trace.|0
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental."|1
"Style over substance. But what a style it is. ""The Cell"" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim."|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released . The controversy that surrounded the original release is enough to kill a thousand flies. For me, it was still enjoyable even though it was a far cry from what the title would lead us to believe.It's pretty hard to write a review without mentioning how much I hated all of the characters in this movie. Even the most interesting characters were not developed properly. In my humble opinion, there were two reasons why I hated so many characters in this movie. 1. They don't act like teenagers.|0
"This was a pretty good episode. Though no ""Trapped in the Closet"" or ""Cartoon Wars,"" it had a lot of things going for it. The character of Al Gore and that bizarre-as-hell ""super cereal"" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman/Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake! ), and he comes within inches of his face."|1
Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for things Egyptian (I grew up loving to visit the mummies in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts) but I think Maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film. The production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character.|1
Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I begin ? The years of hard work paid off in what is a very well done and well shot film. It is probably the best piece of animation to come out of Hollywood for many years. It is interesting to me how this film went from an indie film to a feature film. A lot of the people involved are probably still working in the film or film business but it must have been a great feeling when the film was picked up by Warner Brothers who then released it as a feature.|0
Absolutely , I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting , fascinating and certainly beautiful film. I remember reading some great reviews of this film when I first started watching, and it wasn't until I tried to see the film for the first time that I came across some of the critical remarks (not all of them).The problem isn't with the film at all - I think it was a good film from the start - but with the marketing campaign that took place before the film was released.|0
Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It seems to have already died. Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. I don't know why. It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I've seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne, and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland isn't up to those others. I was just fascinated with the filmmaking.|1
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau.|1
If you are a fan of early Duke movies , this Lone Star oldie is a good one . What made the movie bad was not the story line, which wasn't very interesting, nor the direction, since the characters were too static. This was more like 'The Man from Earth', another film from the same studio (who had also put out the other John Wayne Westerns that year) in which the main character was a lone cowboy with no friends who wanders around a desert looking for an old Indian girl to marry.|0
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. I still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. Like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. The best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change.|1
`` The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends , '' says Marion Fairlie , who with her husband has been making movies in Los Angeles for more than 30 years. I would like to tell you how I saw this movie. Well, I saw it in the cinema as well. The film had a great cast and the director gave me a lot of heart. But the thing is, the plot was so wrong. The idea of a young girl turning into a man is not at all realistic. Especially when you have such a big difference from your birth gender.|0
On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching.|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I've just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast, they are so funny.|1
"I 'll be brief : I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that got under my skin. For example, it's a horror flick, and yet it starts off so innocuously. You don't really see the killer until halfway through the film, and it's only mentioned very briefly.And what was the point of bringing in an ""original"" actress to star in such a film? Yes, she does try her damnedest to pass herself off as a real person, but the rest of the cast are no better than average."|0
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football league after he is booted from his old team. He faces many hardships including an abusive head coach who will do ANYTHING for a victory. His star player gets hurt and has to go on IR, making this even more complicated. What can be said about this piece of shit that hasn't been said? The acting wasn't very good, there weren't enough laughs out of the whole picture, and the ending was a little too abrupt.|0
"Fata Morgana , the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog , filmed over several years in the Swiss Alps, features a beautiful female mountaineer named Lotte Lehmann (Brigitte Helm) suffering from ""mountain sickness"" and taking her life on a treacherous climb up the highest peak in Switzerland.It also features stunning photography by cinematographer Ernst Gmelin ( The Man Who Fell to Earth ). The plot is pretty simple: A woman suffers from a mysterious disease that can only be cured with the help of God, and so an angel flies her up Mount Everest, where she must face the wrath of the mountain gods."|0
"Honestly , when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana , I did not expect it to be that bad.I was expecting a B-movie with some funny lines and decent acting . Instead what I got was two hours of torture. This isn't a really good film.The director is obviously trying to ape ""The Matrix"" but tries to improve on it, but falls short. The only thing I can think of as being good is that the action scenes are better than the ones from the original ""Matrix"". I've just seen this movie, and it's awful."|0
George Cuckor , known as a director of women , could n't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women to star in her film, however, she probably knew it all along that she would only get one shot at making a good movie. This time around, she's not so lucky...I guess I'll start with the actors. Michelle Rodriguez is an extremely pretty and well-endowed Mexican-American babe with the face of a Barbie doll. She has a lot of acting talent but here she falls flat due to some very poor acting choices.|0
"Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. But that's because it didn't have the FUNDING those movies had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on African American historical involvement (and NO, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), Hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make ""Posse"", just so that the story could be told. I think that alone is commendable."|1
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south . The story follows a man and his younger sister as they move to the big city to live with her parents. The older brother is a gang leader but he soon comes into conflict with his violent family.The characters are all very likable and well acted. However, this movie could have been made much better if not for the awful script. This movie has potential. But it just falls apart around the halfway point. For starters, it lacks any kind of real plot line.|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
Very good `` Precoder '' starring Dick Barthelmess , which in a way , kind of reminded me of Hawks . I rented this show last night and found it pretty bad. What really sucked about this show was how lame the writers were for trying to make it something it was NOT. You can't have an hour long episode that has NO plot! They tried to cram two hours of nonsense into 30 minutes! There was not one joke that made no sense, not even one. The whole show seemed like they thought they were making a serious comedy but they were just doing a half-hearted parody.|0
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed . Very funny and the production quality is outstanding . It is worth a watch , I am really surprised this little movie has not been seen by more people . I would give this movie about a B minus or C. If you like campy movies of the 70s with all your favorites, then definitely check this one out. This movie had a lot of laughs but was very forgettable in my view. It was just OK for me. The story didn't have much to work with and the characters were bland and stereotypical.|0
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! When I first tuned in to America's Next Top Model, I expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. I didn't. This show is actually serious fun. I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's Next top model. And it so does! Who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what it's REALLY like.|1
It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of `` slasher '' movies in the early 1980 's , that some would try to create an authentic horror story. However, I don't think anyone could have really expected this movie to reach the success that it did. It is certainly one of the worst films ever made. This film was so bad it made my head hurt. As a horror fan I can safely say I haven't sat through a more inept effort to frighten viewers. The acting was awful and the gore effects were terrible.|0
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the Truth and Reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in developing the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions.|1
I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend . It was a fun romp with some cool acting, but it wasn't so much of a blast to watch that it left me thinking about it for days afterward. I watched this one with a group of friends (not the original cast), and we loved it. But there are two major flaws in this movie, both related to pacing. It is true that there are no really good horror/thriller films made nowadays. In fact, there are lots of them which don't even feature real vampires, werewolves or monsters.|0
The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat , but as the film progresses, the relationship becomes more and more strained. You are in no position to give a real review of such a bad film. I am amazed that the movie was allowed to be shown theatrically. We saw it only at the Cinematheque for one night and left without ever having an intelligent discussion about the issues it raised. The movie did not deal with any aspect of the history or present situation in which we live so well.|0
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain ( of course , because it 's so sensational and makes me want to know more!) I thought it would be a fun read but it turned out to be more boring than any bad movie I can remember. There are only about 6 or 7 scenes that made me angry. I'm not one for reading horror books or seeing horror movies in theaters. But I was looking for something different to do while doing homework. I saw this at a used bookstore near my school and decided to pick it up before going home.|0
In a time of bad , if not plain awful , comedies , King of Queens is more than just good . It is excellent ! This was the worst movie I have ever seen. Not only did they screw up many characters, they killed off most of them. They didn't even bother trying to explain what happened to the main characters or why they were acting like they were being murdered out of revenge. There's nothing funny about being shot, stabbed, hit with a car, drowned, blown up, or having your head torn off and stuffed in a toilet.|0
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer.|1
This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.The most splendid casting I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top grade in this movie.If you see part 1 you will want to see it all. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.I am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can get children to learn history is great.|1
I 'm not gon na lie . To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot and makes your eyelids hurt. When I found out that this movie was going to be in my home town, I was ecstatic. I love cheesy horror comedies, and I really enjoy watching bad movies. This is definitely one of those terrible movies that's just plain bad. Well, it might not be bad, but it has its share of plot holes, stupid jokes, and annoying characters. Let me break down a few of the most obvious:1.|0
"Michelle, Anicée Alvina, was so nice, and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The ""seasons reprise"" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... Please, if you know where i could find a VHS of the film, mail me!! My husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out."|1
"""Jaded"" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. This director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. The rape is brutal not sexual."|1
"I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V . and came across this. I immediately saw that there were two girls on it. The first one (the female model) looked just like me! It took a little while to realize that the other guy on the show had also been looking at her the whole time and he was pretty young too. One of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen, ""Femme Fatale"" features some of the most bizarre images ever put on screen."|0
I ca n't comment on the accuracy of this production , historical or literary , but I can say that there are some things that don't add up . This movie does not live up to its promise. The actors did not have a strong presence in this film.The plot was weak and it was all too predictable. The way they portrayed the characters were not accurate at all. A good script is one that makes you see the movie from different angles, so that you will feel more than just an emotional reaction. This movie has neither. I rented this movie with no real expectations.|0
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I bought it and watched it once. The first 3 hours was a waste of my time but then something funny happened. Why does everyone keep talking about this horror movie, when it's an action thriller? I can't really say that I hate it, but I thought it was bad. This movie isn't very well acted, the script is cheesy, and the ending could have been a good one.The story follows a group of kids who are traveling to see a rock show.|0
"When this show first came on the air , I saw it once or twice and thought it was another crappy soap opera. I didn't give a s*it. I used to have a few friends who hated soap operas. Soap, like any other entertainment medium, is subjective, so we all have our preferences. But one of them really got me hooked. One night, we were watching MASH and they brought up something that stuck with me: The Love Boat. ""Oh man!"" my pal said, ""this must be good."""|0
`` The Cell '' is a rather difficult film to classify . If you read the plot outline , `` The Cell '' would seem to have a lot of similarities with the book of the same name. The main characters (who in this case are three young women) are placed in a cell after being sentenced to two years for something that they did or didn't do. One can understand the fear and desperation that goes through the prisoners, but not the absurdity of the plot. I was pretty shocked when I first saw this film.|0
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford 's best in my opinion . No major stars , but a fine script. I'm sorry to say I can't rate this more than 2 stars due to the fact that if you've got no sense of adventure, drama or suspense then this is probably just for you. The premise of the story was good but the production values were appalling.The film was based on the true story of how a group of soldiers (the Texas Rangers) came across the bodies of Mexican men who had been beheaded and buried along the Rio Grande.|0
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good:The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully.It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined.David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done any better.The Bad:There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old ( I hold a different belief). Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.|1
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. Eg. When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun.|1
"George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis' campy ""Old Acquaintance"" written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a ""serious"" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition."|1
This is a really great film! It gets you thinking about your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as important, we should remember to open up and show them our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely see this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they will post my comment, how odd. Usually online comments need to be short short, and here I am being asked to write more!|1
In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them.|1
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made, ""Murder in the Music Hall"" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. A shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious Rockettes--among them, Vera Ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delectable B-movie starlets of the '40s."|1
"spoiler--In 1993, African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with ""Posse"". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the main character, Jessie Lee.Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba."|1
"At first I could n't tell if it was an art film or a documentary . The day after I saw the opening I had to come back and watch the whole thing again. I kept thinking about how you can tell the difference between an art film and a documentary just from the look of it . In the early seventies, French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard became a household name with his influential films such as ""Nostromo"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""L'Age de Chez Panisse"" and ""Au hasard Balthazar"". One of those movies was ""La Cage aux Folles"" (1986)."|0
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word.|1
"A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn and become comfortable with the political realities.The main character is an English exchange student who moves to Belgium to study, only to find himself drawn into the internal politics of his small nation. One of the most enjoyable movies I've watched in some time. If you're looking for a good film on the Euro, this should be up there with ""Zoolander"". The story is about two brothers from England who have gone to Brussels to attend university."|0
The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values , but very surface level ideas . When I heard there would be a TV mini-series based on Harry Potter, I had high hopes. But alas, they have fallen to pieces. First off, one of the series main plot elements is missing - that of Neville Longbottom's sexuality. The writers have made it painfully obvious that they did not write this subplot out of their script as they should've. It is easy to see how someone might find this show attractive and enjoyable.|0
Fuckland is an interesting film . I personally love the Dogma movement . I wish it had lasted longer . Its a shame to see such a great movie get lost in time . The only saving grace is the superb performance of Robert Englund which really brought the character to life . At times, this movie could have worked better. This is mainly because of how badly the special effects were handled.The plot is basically as follows: A young boy has no idea that he is different than everyone else. He meets another boy and his parents become worried for their safety so they send him off to live with his new friends.|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission , I can only look at this as a political statement from the Government. As an Aboriginal woman, who grew up in remote areas where most people speak no English, it's sad that I'm compelled to sit through another documentary like this one. There has never been a greater need for better education about indigenous affairs and human rights than now, yet the ABC is continuing to ignore this important work. This film seems to serve primarily to try and make the government look good, rather than educating people about what really happened during these years.|0
"* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it. But there's so little of it, and it's so unevenly shot that it feels more like a cheap joke than a real film.The actors seemed to know it was bad, however, and didn't hesitate to let us in on how bad it is: ""This one's pretty bad. We got some really great stuff in this one."" First of all, the title of this film does not make it any better."|0
I'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. And... wouah! The pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by Jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie Abbyss ? Anyway, it's remarkable. Sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on TV, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. The only downside is the commentary.|1
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son  Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson, his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.|1
I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old . I knew nothing of the book other than that it included a boy who falls into a deep, mysterious lake and becomes an islander for some unknown reason.The film was not very good. The actors looked great in costumes but did they have any idea what they were doing? I can't think of a worse way to waste an actor's time. I wish they hadn't tried to recreate the feel of the book.The storyline was confusing. There was no point to the film.|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!|1
I did n't personally know Karen Carpenter , nor , Richard for that matter , so I must go by what other members have to say about them. I've seen this movie at least five times and still find it to be of poor quality and the acting extremely amateurish. What are they trying to convey? Why do all the characters act so strangely in unison? The plot is thin, uninspired, and lacks depth. To me it just doesn't make any sense. At the start of the movie a man has his head stuck in a freezer for several hours.|0
This movie makes you think . It shows how a woman 's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others . I don't want to spoil it for everyone (especially those who will be seeing it after I have finished writing this review), so I'll just go ahead and say that the film has one of the worst opening sequences I've ever seen. The idea is interesting but the execution is bad. We see two old women walking down an empty street, talking about how they are going to retire. As they walk along they suddenly start hearing strange noises which sound like someone being murdered.|0
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. I have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk.i saw this right off Disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie.|1
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job. The movie's point is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view.The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age. The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over. Although the text of `The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.|1
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.Despite incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners.Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him.|1
there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie.|1
During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against a Yankee invasion.In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional feature-length films. With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG. Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success.|1
* * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * THE CELL / ( 2000 ) The Cell is the biggest disappointment of all time. This is one of those movies you want to see and then realize that it's more like a bad joke. I'm not sure what the point was in this film but it seems to have nothing to do with the actual movie at all. I've heard some good things about this movie on the internet. And even though I saw it on TV, I was disappointed by the film for the first half hour.|0
After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up ""pronoun trouble"" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I've laughed at since I was a kid."|1
i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it.|1
Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well.|1
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.'|1
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; ""We're Men in tights!"""|1
Although dated , this film is definitely worth a watch . I saw it about eight times as a teenager and it still makes me laugh . This film has so many interesting scenes and dialogs that it keeps on surprising me . A must see for any fans of science fiction or the sci-fi movies of the 1970's ! I have to say, I never really cared for T2: Tribes (and there are plenty of reasons why I don't think it's an excellent film). It had some good moments, but overall felt like a step down in quality from the original.|0
This show is my absolute favorite . This show is intelligent , entertaining and always full of surprises . Lauren Graham is simply stunning as a mother , wife , daughter and sister . The acting is top notch too . I really can't get enough of this show.The best part about this show is it is funny and very much true to the original source material . This show is a must see by everyone interested in movie making . I love this show. I don't know why. It seems that every episode has a surprise that will leave you slack-jawed. The writing is smart.|0
Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster ( a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV 's `` Land of the Lost '' fame ) sets out to find his missing dog. In the early sixties, a film is released that depicts an alternate and much more dangerous version of our world. An underground organization has set up a series of tunnels under Los Angeles in order to create a city of pure darkness where they will live forever. One of the members of this secret group is a man named Frank West ( Robert Mitchum) who is sent to investigate.|0
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there . Alright , more than a little ... I can't really say whether it's good or not. But the premise and execution are so off on both parts that it makes one wonder what the point of making the film was in the first place.The problem with this movie is two-fold.One, the main characters all have such terrible voices that they make you question if they had any other lines at all ! The other problem is the fact that the movie is set in an alternate universe where the dinosaurs are still alive and killing people.|0
15 PARK AVENUE is the address `` Mithi/Mithali '' ( Konkona ) is in search for from the movies beginning to end. First, the story is poor and boring, but the characters are not good. It is all about Krishna who has been dead for 30 years or so, now reincarnated into a woman. The movie does not explain any of these facts. WOW! I was looking forward to watching this movie on a rainy night because i wanted to catch a good action movie with lots of gun shots. Boy oh boy, i was wrong! !|0
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters. As a result, few people actually saw this movie before it disappeared from the schedule. In addition, I've never seen any other movie like it. I had to watch it just to find out what the heck it was about. I know it's been a while but I can't get rid of this film! The plot is as bad as you would think and the acting was awful. There are two things that really kill this movie though: 1.|0
"I viewed The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' tight script was just what this evening of ""shorts"" needed. It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. The Reader was simple story telling in it's best form, well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted."|1
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, ""Rabbit Seasoning"" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqué for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did."|1
I liked this a lot . The camera angles are cool , it 's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch Project. However, the story itself is totally unbelievable . I can't believe there's so many people that would actually do this to themselves . When I first stumbled upon this documentary I was completely floored because I was a fan of the show. I didn't even watch it, as I thought it was just a silly little piece of entertainment, but I watched it again tonight, and I couldn't believe how much of what I'd heard was accurate.|0
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris . We 're all here on an exchange so I wanted to rent it. I thought it had good reviews and was fairly well known in France (the only French person that I knew had seen it was one of my friends). Well... It was a total disaster. The acting was really awful, the plot seemed very weak, the pacing was bad and the dialog was not understandable. For a film that is supposed to be funny it was pretty stupid too.|0
"Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot . Bugs of Daffy . He 's unsure whether or not to go through with it, but as he starts walking towards the house he realizes that he must either kill or let the killer come in.This is probably the worst film ever made where the director has attempted to make a suspenseful thriller. In spite of being an old time horror movie, I can't see how anyone could have been shocked by this ""discovery"". It's just so predictable and stupid."|0
1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in the wild. A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers.|1
"During the War for Southern Independence , GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against the invading Union troops. When he's unable to stop the rebels, he uses his ""superior force"" to capture them and hold them captive. Well, this is about as entertaining as you'll ever find in the world of action/adventure movies.It's a pretty sad way to spend a Saturday afternoon.The film starts out with one of the more typical ""hero rescues"" I've seen over the years - a woman gets caught in some traffic and must rely on her motorcycle to get home safely."|0
"Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore . I 'm sure it pisses a few liberals off . But in all fairness, that is the point of this show. The first thing you will notice upon viewing this episode is the horrible acting. This is the most terrible acting I have ever seen! It is very obvious they didn't spend hours and hours on each scene. For example, in the beginning, there's a scene where Tom Hanks is sitting in a chair and he says something like, ""We're just getting started"" but then he starts to speak."|0
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That being said, I think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. This is not the fault of the boys however. They even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption.|1
Being an avid Carpenter Fan , I really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired, in my humble opinion). There were several parts of this movie that made me laugh out loud. The acting is quite good overall and all the characters are well-developed. This is what happens when people who write books about the occult give you a script to make a TV movie based on them. You get a very bad piece of crap that attempts to blend the paranormal with a horror/thriller/drama plot. I am a fan of the book series so I wanted to see how it turned out.|0
This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes ( with the exception of the final episode which I didn't find interesting). We learn about two women who work together in an art gallery; one of them goes to prison while she gets a new boyfriend. She decides to take him back to her place and they have sex on her living room couch. So, my friends and I went to see this movie last week and honestly...it's just not as bad as we thought it might be!|0
"""Two Hands"" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity."|1
"One of the best ! As being a fan of the civil war , I was very pleased with the movie. It had good action scenes and the storyline was quite interesting . The music was good , though not exactly what I would want to listen to while watching a film, but well it was entertaining all the same . The only things that bugged me were the actors , i couldnt really understand their accent , and the dialogues . I'm going to warn you...this is a bad movie. Not necessarily in ""good"" or ""wish it weren't"" type of bad."|0
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this.|1
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'Alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this.|1
I 'm a fan of independent film . Dialogue driven , character study pieces are where it 's at for me and this one did not disappoint.The lead is good as usual, so is the supporting cast, who were all just as likable as the lead. A very interesting movie with lots of action scenes and suspense. The story revolves around a couple who fall in love and have a kid that gets stolen by a group of kidnappers. What happens next is fascinating. I know it sounds silly, but what really got my attention was how realistic some of these scenes were.|0
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations, including the Edgar Reitz office.|1
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen . To explain my experience , let me start by saying that for quite a few years I have been watching American Horror Story on the Sci Fi channel, so when this came on, I was intrigued. I've never watched The Box before but it seemed strange enough that I decided to give it a shot.This is one of those rare movies that make you want to scream in disbelief at how wrong and evil it all is ! The only way I could describe the movie would be horror-comedy with a twist.|0
After searching for 6 months , I finally found this DVD . All I can say is it was damn worth the wait and effort . I read a review that stated this show was not very good. Well, I watched it and...it kind of was. However, if I wasn't as familiar with the series, I'd probably have had a negative opinion about it. Let's start at the beginning.... There are two types of bad movies: those that are made to entertain and those that are made to offend. This one is the latter.|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. Central to the story is Xavier ( Romain Duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. He learns about life and love rapidly. Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. The rest of the cast also play well.|1
This film had me spellbound this evening . Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted . John Voight is still a wonderful actor even at his advanced age ( 70 ), but there are times when you want him to move on . I have to say that the performances here were all very nice , except maybe for one or two who should have been left out of the credits. My friend brought this DVD to our house for X-mas. At first, she was excited about it because it looked like a good movie.|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . Okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but it`s still compelling . Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott`s performance as DCI Red Metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . It`d be easy for Stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way .|1
"The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar (""The Saint"") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as ""Pearly"" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool!"|1
After I 've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this thing. It was an okay movie, but not great. The story line is just plain stupid (even if the ending seemed to be foreshadowing a future event)and the acting by the main two actors was not what I expected from them. This film has no redeeming features whatsoever. If you are looking for mindless action, this is the movie for you. In fact, most of the scenes in this film are boring.|0
"I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am . My brother and I were channel surfing on free time and we decided to give it a whirl. I thought the movie would have something to do with pirates but after watching it, i was confused as to why the pirates were attacking the giant sea beast , the ocean. This film has all the potential to be a great horror flick, or if it was done right, a great ""mystery thriller"".The plot line is somewhat interesting (the characters are all different) but the writing is just plain poor."|0
"There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story , where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, when the song ""I've Grown Up"" suddenly cuts in on their performance. This film is so ridiculous I can't believe some people think it's good to be honest. One of the best movies I have ever seen. It is about two guys from Brooklyn trying to make money by working as a hit man for a group of Mexican assassins. Their first assignment is to get revenge on the police officers who killed someone close to one of them years before."|0
If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.|1
"Hallelujah ! ! ! ! Finally , a true Colombian film crosses the border ( s ) to shows how much worse it is over here. Very bad, VERY bad ! The only good thing about this movie was the sound mixing, which is decent. If you are on the lookout for ""bad"" films with a lot of nudity or sex, give this one a try. So, I've just seen this film, at least I assume that's what they called it. A friend sent me a link to it, and I said I'd watch it, but didn't expect too much."|0
I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool . I watched it with my friends and after a couple of minutes we were all hooked on it and wanted to see it. Well, its been 2 years since it came out and I still haven't seen it. What's the deal with these sequels? What's the purpose? Why do people seem to get so excited about them anyway? It makes no sense. First of all, they're not sequel to movies or TV shows they're sequels to movies and TV shows that have already been made.|0
"Surprisingly good made for T.V. Thriller. I wasn't expecting too much from this one but I'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. It's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.The background story of Thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.The ""stranger"" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society."|1
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it. That's because not only is the plot simple, but this film also has so much violence that you will want to scream at the screen.The movie starts with three young teens hanging out in a dark basement. Then, a woman appears on the second floor, dressed in a nightgown. She turns out to be a witch who uses an electric drill to transform her husband into a dog. The boys try to fight back, but they are easily subdued and turned into dogs along with their friends.|0
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright , Wagon Master was one of Ford 's favorite movies. While it wasn't overly bad, it was not an A-grade picture either. That's a bit of a problem in a film like this, since we all knew what we were getting into. First of all, I thought it was a very good movie until I finished it. The acting is top notch, there is no filler whatsoever. However, the story itself is rather disappointing. There are many aspects of the story to be considered and I'm willing to see where they end up.|0
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time . We loved it so much . It was the perfect blend of black crime, cop drama and good acting . I just wish I could have watched it when I was younger because I think my mind would've been blown as a result . I had heard a lot of hype about this show, but after reading some of the comments, I was surprised that this show actually got a second season. Well, first off, I don't even like detective fiction. I usually enjoy shows with a mystery or cops and robbers story.|0
"This is definitely an excellent show . I do n't have cable , so I started renting them , because they were on the Disney Channel . I watched it during the middle of the month , when I had extra time to kill . The acting and writing are just perfect . This show has no redeeming value for me, it's not that bad if you're looking for something to get you into a good mood, but once you watch it, you find yourself wondering ""what happened here?"". This show is terrible. And there is really nothing else like it in this day and age."|0
"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""the murder mystery"", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced)."|1
This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes.|1
"Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings . In Europe , where the director of this movie lived , they do not speak such language . The story is simple, but the characters are so interesting . I found myself watching this movie with tears in my eyes. It's a good movie to watch with young kids , because it does not have any adult content ! This movie has been rated 7/10 by European Film Institute and 8/10 by Italian Academy of Cinema
What a disappointment - there's no suspense at all."|0
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie . My teen-agers enjoyed it over the summer and my son even commented on how funny it seemed. As usual, the movie's plot is not that exciting and the characters are pretty predictable (but they are likable, anyway.) But what makes the movie interesting is the cast of characters, especially the kids. There really is something about having them around that causes you to question everything you see. My friends and I rented this because we weren't into the films we were given at the local multiplex.|0
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). However, the principal acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress ""Nefer""."|1
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight , he lives in this burned down old hotel , where eight teenaged girls and two of their male friends hang out to get laid. I'm really disappointed in this one. I mean, I've seen pretty much every horror movie made, so it's no biggie that they all suck - but this just seemed like it wasn't funny at all. The main character was kind of annoying and his relationship with the local cop didn't seem very strong. In general, it just wasn't as good as the movies I saw last night.|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie.|1
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, ""just right"" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi."|1
"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice pronounces the words ""Puerto Rican"" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, called ""Old Acquaintance"", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other."|1
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?The answer become less clear as the film goes on.Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.Chris Rock  though as foul-mouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as Wesley.|1
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford 's work . Mainly because it 's the only one of his films where Ford is credited as writer/director. I've seen many others with him credited as co-writer, editor, etc. In fact, he did not even write the script. After seeing this movie today for the first time I had to tell myself that I shouldn't have wasted so much time on it. After all, it has no redeeming features and almost no redeeming quality in terms of acting, writing or direction.|0
After `` Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman '' with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as bad or worse as men on TV, and this movie did not disappoint! Let me preface by saying: I have never watched a television show where so many things were wrong. The acting is horrible. The dialogue is terrible. The plot doesn't make any sense. There are too many scenes that happen in slow motion (which makes no sense at all). And don't let anyone tell you that this is an action flick.|0
"America 's next top model is a good show , it helps people with their careers , but lately i have not been able to get my head above water even watching the episodes
One of those shows that I don't know why anyone would want to watch. There isn't a lot of plot, there is not a lot of comedy, and some of the actors are pretty bad. The characters are basically flat and they seem to be written for no reason. The only redeeming feature about this show is that the jokes are funny and the acting is solid."|0
...I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember each black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary, those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the Gatling in it firing away, the last fight between Peck and the chief, and the Happy End which let me take back my breath.|1
"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much . The theme was well handled by the Director with great production values. It is good that the family and friends could share in this movie together.I would not recommend this film to any one who does not wish to be entertained. What a joke this movie is... I can't believe that anyone thought that this movie would be successful because it's supposed to be about ""family"". I have never seen such a pathetic attempt at entertainment, comedy, romance, friendship, etc. This is an absolute waste of time, effort and money."|0
"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called ""Good"". We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship."|1
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""Adam's Rib"" ""Holiday"" Psycho melodramas ""Gaslight"" ""A Double Life"" a great semi western ""Heller in Pink Tights"" not to mention ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Travels with my Aunt"" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera."|1
I couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.|1
I get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. I have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and I am surprised at just how much I am enjoying it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait.|1
Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big!|1
"This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However the same cannot be told of the gals. In the end too, u see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was ""There was no Taylor"". And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of Ben. Also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben."|1
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) ."|1
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is.|1
This was a pretty good episode . Though no `` Trapped in the Closet '' or `` Cartoon Wars ,`` this has a nice twist. This is not your typical cop-show setup, but it works well enough. As far as my experience with `Law & Order` goes, I like that it tries different things and gets good results from them. It's a shame that when the producers are looking at casting for an episode, they only consider black people for roles. That is the saddest thing about Law & Order: SVU.|0
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC , or any big city of mid-century America.This is a great depiction of NYC 's culture. I have seen lots of documentaries on Brooklyn, but never one with this kind of authenticity. The whole thing has a feel of New York as you are seeing it in real life.There are interesting interviews with the characters, and there's a great sequence where we see the Statue of Liberty up close. First off, I hate to say it, but the show is terrible. From start to finish, this show was unbearable.|0
Having just watched this with my mother ( Who got it for Christmas ) i was thrilled to find something from the 80's that has been re-imagined. The movie is about a young girl who falls for a man she barely knows. She decides to break up with him and moves to a small mountain town where she runs into old men. One day they decide to kill each other. After this happens, the woman wakes up in the body of her dead lover. What a stupid movie!! I mean really stupid.|0
This comment discusses `` North and South Book I '' dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is a fascinating one to study. It was a time when a man from New York had more chances of becoming President than any other in American History. When he did win, it was almost universally accepted that it was because of something his ancestors had done during the Revolutionary War. (And we are talking about an America which had no income tax or sales taxes at that time.) I've always liked the movies set in the 1800's, especially the old silent pictures.|0
"A classic late 50 's film . The superannuated headliners ( Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan ) are not at their peak , but they don't play a part of this one. It's about the life of a young man in America trying to make his way through the hard life of the urban ghetto . I saw it with an old high school friend on our last week out in Los Angeles, and it was quite an experience . My first reaction to this piece is: why? This movie does nothing but remind me that I have never seen any of the other ""horror classics"" produced by Columbia Pictures."|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish movie on cinema! Therefor, I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of thrill and humour is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea.|1
GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen.. He acts it up, perfectly. This was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is.. It almost made me cry watching him.I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend to John Belushi as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. Very sad, what both of them went through.I really felt for both Val and Robin during his rough times.|1
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work.|1
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak.|1
The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! We have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. Its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system.|1
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound effect on me. I couldn't sleep for a week afterward, and I didn't really understand how something so awful could be made. In fact, I just kept thinking about it, until my friend told me he'd seen it, and I decided to give it a whirl.The film is about a 14 year old high school kid (who goes by the name ""Jules"" at school) who moves to Florida with his family for a summer job."|0
Most of these reviews are dead on, so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here.While the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. Here in the USA, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused.|1
"I get really fed up with sitcoms ; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny and becomes just irritating.This show is no exception. I am a huge fan of the original 'Full House'. The first few episodes were pretty great. In fact for about half of the first season, they were some of the best shows on tv! I have nothing against these comedies. I've had a couple of good ones in my time. I do however, find myself wishing that ""Full House"" wasn't such a one-note sitcom."|0
What can I say? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule.MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.But be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a gruesome film.|1
`` The Cell '' is an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a great writer but also, more importantly, into our culture. I saw this movie twice in theatres (once on DVD and once at another theater). I could not believe that this was a movie made by people who have any kind of training in film, because it was so ineptly written and directed.The plot consists of four kids (three boys and one girl) going into a basement to play chess. One of their opponents, a blind guy, sees them leaving and comes after them.|0
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Renée Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.|1
"The ""Hunting Trilogy"" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the ""greatest"" or ""most important"" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made."|1
"I was drawn to ""Friends"" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called ""Seasons"", then I found the Elton John song ""Friends"" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of ""Friends"" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love."|1
I have watched this show from the beginning, and I am a 45 year old man. To me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family.|1
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80 's inbred/backwood slash-fest, but there are some aspects of this movie which I feel are worthy of attention. Let me start by giving you a brief background as to why I believe this film has some interesting elements about it. For one thing, I've always felt there is a certain amount of ""greediness"" in American movies these days. We live in an age where everyone seems to think they're entitled to have their needs met no matter what, from food to sex to shelter."|0
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross. But what I didn't realize at the time was this is actually pretty good trash. It starts off strong but then slows down. I'm sure you can guess where this goes. The most boring movie ever... The plot is predictable and the whole thing takes way to long to do anything. And while it has some good special effects, it still isn't very convincing. This is about as far as I have gone into my dislike of B-movies.|0
Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a wonderful central performance from Renée Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fiancé and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him.Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless.|1
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.This film is a pre-code because of several reasons.|1
`` Side Show '' is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures . Very gory, full of gore, blood and sex. It is very slow-paced and the ending makes you wonder how much longer they will let this movie to run on. My problem with this film is not just its lack of suspense but also its blatant attempt at humor. If it weren't for the awful voice overs (I've been through a lot since I'm 19 years old) or the acting, it might be acceptable. But as it stands, it's plain awful.|0
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious Camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians.|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect.|1
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V. and came across this film. I don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well, my meeting was pushed back, because I couldn't get out of this film. It had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it.|1
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
I love this film (dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name! ), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries, and of the city itself. I really want to see the followup 'Les Poupees Russes ' (the Russian Dolls), I'm guessing it wont be released here?|1
"It has been recorded that John Ford made the ""big, blockbuster"" movies so that he could afford to make the ""small"" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film."|1
"This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and ""man of the house"". It could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really?"|1
I 've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since I saw it in a bargain bin for about half-price. The fact that it's so cheap means that it must be awful, but it isn't. It may not be on par with Saw or the original Evil Dead, but it's no slouch either. There are no jump scares nor is there much gore or nudity. This is an average film with a few decent moments. I'm a horror fan, but I have never experienced a truly horrible movie in my life.|0
King of Queens is comic genius . Kevin James , whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny , his accent is perfect and so is the character.The plot, which isn't really a plot at all, follows Doug after he discovers that his father has been killed by someone who used to work as an IPS driver. I don't think you can write bad reviews for a movie with this much talent behind it. Kevin James was the perfect man for the role and I am sure he did his best to make the role his own.|0
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'Wagon Master' made after two big Indian-cavalry epics... It is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... It didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...Photographically, it is extremely simple... The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons...|1
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear in. Three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer from ""For A Few Dollars More,"" and the third is garbed like Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins."|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it.Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it.|1
I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end.|1
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. A true, polished, diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character ""Conrack"") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. At first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home."|1
Sweeping drama with great sets , costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett , Scarlett , Melanie and Brandy, who were not even born yet at the time they filmed this one  all in the same movie. I don't remember watching this movie, but I'm sure I have seen it before. It was a good-looking old movie that I've never seen in the theater. However, like so many other films from the 70's, I must say I felt cheated by the ending. At about the halfway point, I was left wondering what the hell was going on.|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic.|1
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class . The musicianship of this band is second to none. I've heard nothing but great things about the quality of the recording so i was excited to check it out. My first thoughts were wow...this is going to be incredible...it's going to sound like it's straight out of the '80's. This is a great movie for a fan of sci fi and space shows. The story isn't the most original, nor is the concept interesting, however, it's still worth seeing because of the actors involved.|0
I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. I was intrigued by the premise of a serial killer who kidnaps beautiful women, then kills them. I didn't expect to get anything more from the idea, but something about the fact that no one could catch him made it fascinating. Wandering around the streets of San Francisco you might see a lot of people haggling with other people as they pass by. That's what this movie is really all about.|0
I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to see but couldn't, and I can't imagine anyone doing anything better with what they had. The premise of this movie (if that's the word I'm going for) is interesting. Two friends who each happen to have a very small amount of money set out to make a movie. What they get instead is a nightmare scenario in which everyone is unhappy and nobody really wants to be there.|0
"Most of these reviews are dead on , so I 'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions. I wanted to like this film because I saw it for the first time at a VHS swap meet and thought ""This movie has potential! This guy could have made something good!"" However, even though the film itself is somewhat promising, I was completely let down when I actually started watching it. The plot is very basic: A man is murdered by his best friend (played by Gary Busey)."|0
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their ""Erasmus year"" in Barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal location. The idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about the countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries.Having experienced ""Erasmus"" on myself during my exchang semester in Italy I can say that is movie is incredibly authentic."|1
"I did n't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn . I do n't know why I keep buying them, they are just so mediocre. It had no real plot, there is no conflict or suspense and not a lot of humor. Also, my wife kept calling me from the store to see if I were okay because it sounded like I was getting out of control. Oh well, I guess we can all agree this is what movie fans look for in movies these days. A couple of friends invited me over last night to watch a ""comedy"" horror movie called ""Just Before Dawn""."|0
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clichéd but still true, know what I'm saying.I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I'm more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France.|1
I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic!|1
"Believe it or not , the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once , and was missing for nearly two years. It is in fact still missing . If I could show you the painting, I'd be so happy. What can I say about a movie that tries so desperately to be something it isn't? You get all sorts of clichés (I'm sorry, ""horror/thriller"") as well as overplayed plot twists that don't quite come into play. The special effects are OK but there's no sense of depth to the monsters' moves. This film is terrible!"|0
I viewed The Reader at Sugar , which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything , and the movie was so bad that I literally couldn't even talk about it. As far as I could tell, the problem was with the script and the actors. This is one of those terrible movies that you just can't put a finger on. I've always liked the first two Star Trek series. This third film didn't hold my interest, unless it was to witness the birth of the evil Spock. In any case, I don't know what went wrong with this film.|0
My favorite film this year . Great characters and plot , and the direction and editing was smooth , visually . This is a really great film to get people excited for next year's movies ! This was one of the better films of 2007. I can't say that because I just saw it. The movie opens up with a bang (literally) as two guys meet on a cross country road trip, eventually falling in love. The story then focuses on their relationship, starting at their first date and ending about three weeks later.|0
"""L'Auberge Espagnole"" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. And it is wise by the way. ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona."|1
"This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking . I 'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and think beyond their box. After watching the previews for this film, you may be thinking, ""it's just like 'Passion of the Christ'. Except this time there are no crucifixes!"" That's not at all the case. Passion of the Christ is one of the most well-done films that I have ever seen, and this is another example of why. The actors are great in this film too. And the script is very funny, with many references to other films."|0
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning , and have felt it is overlooked at the award ceremonies for no real reason . This was the first time I saw it on DVD ,and now I see that it is just as good as any other show they have done . This movie is a complete waste of time, my friend and i were both going through this movie to watch it with him one day after work. He picked up the DVD, turned it on and went right to the part where he's standing by his computer talking to a friend.|0
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along.|1
These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny ( and fun ) puns . The first shot we see in the pilot is of a train, but when they come back to the island for the big reveal it's on a jet. There was nothing great about this TV movie. What little good I can say about it is because I have seen far worse. In fact, my expectations were much too low.First off, the storyline was incredibly cliched and totally predictable. The plot wasn't very compelling at all and lacked anything that makes a film truly good.The only thing that was even vaguely intriguing was the characters.|0
"An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in Bogotá, you can feel the total meaning of the word ""Bluff""(although is a Colombian film, the title is in presented in English); ! The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who find his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; after this Nicolas is left without girlfriend and without any job."|1
"Onstage John Osborne 's adaptation of `` Picture of Dorian Gray '' is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde 's most famous play and the tragic love story that was its source material.The film starts with the main character being taken prisoner by the Duke of Malfi, who is trying to rid his country of homosexuality. A couple of years later the Duke falls madly in love with Dorian while serving in the French army during World War I.
I'm sure I've read this novel several times but my memory is too bad to tell you if it was as terrible as I remember."|0
"This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does n't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with its share of bright moments. ""Lone Ranger"" is a mediocre movie that features very poor acting, lousy plot development, boring dialogue, and laughable dialog. I can't say that ""Lone Ranger"" is an outright bad movie, only that it is one of the worst movies ever made. The main problem is the acting. There are many performances that are just absolutely awful. Some of the worst actors in Hollywood have done such memorable roles that they deserve a lot of respect."|0
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. It really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the Aussie humor. They portray it very well and very realistically.|1
Our America is multi-cultural , with so many sub-cultures . This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time from the lives of these people at one point in time, and does NOT give the viewer an understanding of why it was or is what it is. I don't think this is a movie for children. If you are under 6 please do not see this movie. This film is about an interracial couple who move to a new town in a small town and find that racial tension is running high.|0
there 's only so much that i can take of Filipino films , especially nowadays where the trend is sexploitation with no story line or direction , it's as if they cut and paste whatever they like on to make a quick buck, there's hardly any plot , characters , development or anything at all, its just a whole bunch of naked chicks in tight outfits dancing around and slapping each other. What a piece of trash! There is nothing for me to say about this film. Its not funny, its not dramatic, its not interesting, and its not original.|0
My favorite film this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. Set in Barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired.|1
Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie . They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine throughout. The only problem with this movie is that it seems to drag a bit. This is an excellent movie, but unfortunately, it isn't very good at any of these things that make movies great. The acting is average at best, the action sequences are uneventful, and although the plot contains some intriguing twists, they don't hold up for long.The pacing is all over the map, from one event to the next.|0
"A remarkable film , bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much , much younger. A truly touching and moving film about love and life in modern times . If you want a movie that will give you a good scare, check out this movie. The scares are so over the top that even the most jaded among us will have a few seconds of pause at the end before saying ""that was just stupid."" It is absolutely unbelievable how this story could have led to such a ridiculous ending (which is exactly what it was).The film starts off well enough."|0
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old . It wasn't long before I was hooked and it has remained a favourite ever since. I still think of it on occasion but to watch it again in its new form is quite surreal. It is hard to believe that there was a time when ""Halloween"" was a cult phenomenon. For the uninitiated, this movie was made in the late '60's and brought the slasher movie to the screen for the first time. What makes this movie so terrible?"|0
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. George Sanders is suave and witty. Jonathan Hale simply is Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie.|1
"""Two Hands"" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local ""Big"" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected."|1
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by Ford favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western ""Wagon Train"" before his untimely death at age 57."|1
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point."|1
"I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie ""Mighty Joe Young."" What attracted me to ""Wagon Master"" were the great songs sung by the ""Sons of the Pioneers."" Merian C. Cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong."|1
"I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a ""typical"" human alike or different than Rose? Lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy?"|1
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant use of nudity. My wife and I were in the cinema with another couple and our eyes kept wandering up and down the aisles at least five times. This was an absolutely disgraceful film. If you think about it there is no good reason for that girl to dress up as a little boy. It is far from funny - it is more like something one might expect out of a low budget pornographic film than a mainstream family film.|0
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area , and it was quite clear that most people were disappointed. Some of these critics seemed to believe that the film had some ""message"". This is an awful movie, but I guess there are worse ones out there. The acting is terrible, the plot is boring, and the storyline is a bit of a travesty. There are very little jokes and even less action. I think the best way to watch this movie would be to get up and walk out after each scene."|0
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they have believable motivations. When it fails on both these, the film falls flat. A romantic comedy with no depth whatsoever. Some of the scenes are amusing, others are downright irritating. The script was clearly written in haste, with little thought as to how much time will be allowed for exposition and character development. The screenplay is full of bad puns and wordplay (I swear I didn't catch a single one! ).|0
"I'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) The sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. It's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's ""running the show,"" so I'm glad the movie doesn't try."|1
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper , which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines two different types of genre, and does so in a smart way. It's hard not to admire the acting from the mostly young cast. My girlfriend and I both love action movies so I thought I would check this out.I thought it might be great. Boy was I wrong. The opening scene of this movie was very well done. The fight scenes were also very well done.Unfortunately the plot did not deliver what was promised. The bad guy didn't have a reason to be at the warehouse.|0
"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, ""Friends"" goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences."|1
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.|1
"I 'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things . However , SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of writing . As the story progressed I became more and more fascinated with the whole scene . And as the suspenseful parts went on I was thinking to myself "" WTF !"" . It was like watching a soap-opera , except that no one dies ! In fact , this isn't even a horror film. The only reason I rated this at a three instead of five is because of my love for the original The Shawshank Redemption. This movie did not have any redeeming qualities for me."|0
I saw `` The Reader '' at a film festival in Manhattan this week . It touched my heart in the most touching way, and I felt compelled to write a comment about it.A young woman (Gloria Foster) goes to spend her life in a monastery with a priest (John Gielgud). She loves him, but does not understand how she is going to be with him for the rest of her days after her father (Robert Duvall), who died when Gloria was an infant, comes back to visit.|0
I have n't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way it was as if the world around me was being torn out of my body, like I had just taken an extremely strong tranquiliser. It was this powerful feeling that I wanted to remember every time I see it. This movie is terrible. You know how sometimes when you read a bad book for the first time you feel like you can't put the book down, then after a few days you can finally put it down.|0
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ""slasher"" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great ""rare"" film from Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films ""Squirm"" and ""Blue Sunshine"".Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."|1
I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it . What a movie . I am surprised no one else liked it because it is not just a good movie it is one of those movies that you keep going back to even after viewing it a couple of times . The actors are great as well . Don Johnson in particular has an interesting take on the character . This movie had a lot of fun playing with the conventions of the genre . It was also funny, if predictable at times but never really boring . First off, i have seen every film by Kevin Smith.|0
I could n't believe the eye candy from start to finish . Being a fan of movies directed by music video directors I couldn't imagine that it was going to turn out as badly as it did . This is a very bad movie. It has no originality, and is just a rehash of what others have already done. The plot is pretty weak. The characters are all clichés. The acting is atrocious. Some scenes are so bad that I didn't laugh for a good part of the time. And there is not enough sex!|0
"John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture , 'Wagon Master ' made after two big Indian-cavalry war films, and which is about to have its 50th birthday on Jan. 1. I'll admit to having no clue what was going on; but this film left me baffled. I'd never heard of ""Wagon Master"". I didn't realize it was being made by the same team that made ""Bare Knuckle"" (1980). So who would make an action movie based on a true story?"|0
I 'm not the type of person to watch T.V . shows because the acting normally sucks or it 's just plain boring, I 've seen one show that is good but i 'd like more. The drama in this show is extremely slow paced and the main character has no charisma whatsoever (at least that's how i see it ). It's quite obvious that they tried to do an action-adventure style show which was a mistake because most of the people on the show are pretty unimpressive as actors. This may very well be the worst TV show I have ever seen.|0
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be in and I believe it has done well and held up over time. Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd.It may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment.|1
I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track will be released, Ilona Sekacz' work is truly enduring. Twenty years on I am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. Somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction? ), Catherine descends on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney.|1
"comeundone , I love you ! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this film. There are no real characters, the story line is non-sensical and most of it just doesn't work.The only thing that will make you want to see it is the soundtrack by the legendary Rammstein man, Thomas Beier. My first ever viewing of this movie had me scratching my head while watching. It started out like any other ""drama"" piece that would be found on TV or seen on cable, however, I soon found myself falling asleep at the keyboard trying to make sense of what was happening."|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn ` t get to see the original teleplay untill a few weeks ago. Now that I have re-watched the movie, I am amazed at how poorly it was done! There were some moments in the movie where there seemed to be so much going on I wasn't sure who was speaking. This is a serious problem with movies like this. At times they will take you out of what is really happening in the movie and cause you to feel as if you don't know what is going on.|0
It 's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand it's a bit funny, but on the other you are wondering just what is going on. If you happen to live in the Adelaide area, then there are a couple of nice bars that might be good starting points. What can I say. This is not very good at all. The first half hour was pretty good; however, by the third hour I was totally bored and even the actors had gone soft. In short, this was a horrible film.|0
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. I can still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I though wow this looks exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see book one and two on TV in the Netherlands.|1
I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old , ( having an existing interest in sci-fi ) . I never thought it was very good, and I found it hard to swallow that a movie like this has made it to the top 100 grossing of all time. I guess my opinion doesn't count as much as others do, but it's still wrong.First let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of sci-fi, Star Trek, Terminator, Alien, Aliens, etc. These are the kinds of movies you have to see if you want to become a genre fan.|0
"""Side Show"" is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer makes it out to be (The Trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). Also, the acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.8 out of 10Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks."|1
I too saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since and I wander why it has gone to the wayside.|1
I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday ( 4 February , 2006 ) and came away with a really bad feeling about what the makers of this film would have done had they had the ability to create. I was under the impression that the cast had gone out and done some acting training but I can only assume that was a ruse to make them look smart. This is the worst film i have seen in my life! This is all about a bunch of losers, who are living lives of depravation and despair, when one of their friends comes up with an idea: Let's sell drugs.|0
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product.I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa(?) accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing ""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Trainspotting"" or any other film with heavy-accented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes."|1
It has been recorded that John Ford made the `` big , blockbuster '' movies so that he could afford to shoot them cheaply. His first three pictures were all released in the 1950's with very low budget. One of the key factors which helped John Ford to make his films cheap was the fact that they were based on true events . In fact most of them were. This allowed him to tell a story that many people wanted to hear. When I first saw this movie my first thought was that it was a bit too fast paced.|0
"As I was reading through the comments , I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was worse than the book, which is a great shame, since I love both books. There are quite a few things in this movie that just aren't true. So, here's what I would like you to consider:

a) The ""plot"" of the book is far better than this movie. b) The screenplay for the novel is much more original and enjoyable. c) A lot of people seem to think it's all the same story, which is also inaccurate."|0
Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made , `` Murder in the Music Hall '' seems to have undeservably lost a lot of its appeal. Perhaps it was the film's poor special effects, but I don't know. What I do know is that I still think this movie should be seen by every moviegoer. This is not necessarily because I like horror movies (although some of my fondest memories are of them), but because, even though they aren't particularly scary or gory, they are all so different from the rest of their genre.|0
"One of the many backwoods horror 's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones (and not that I'm complaining)
When I was a kid, I loved Halloween. It was scary, it had lots of gore, but most importantly it scared the bejeebus out of me. I never really got to see it as an adult, and now that I have, I wish I had seen it when I was a child. This movie didn't exactly hit all my expectations."|0
"This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park . Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to gain admission to the boys private school. He meets the teacher and her son, then proceeds to act like a total idiot for the entire episode.I have never seen this episode before, so I will just say this, its probably the worst episode of South Park ever (second only to ""Cherokee Hair-do"". ) The acting isn't much better than it was in ""Cherokee Hair-do"" either. It is always a pleasure to see South Park put out a new episode."|0
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.|1
"Having just got the ""Loony Tunes Golden Collection""(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.Rabbit Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being ""Rabbit Fire"" and ""Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and Daffy argue about who Elmer Fudd should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!"|1
"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us..."" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery."|1
"This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with."|1
"Style over substance . But what a style it is . `` The Cell '' is the internal version of the movie. It is a thriller with all the usual tricks used up to that stage. As far as special effects are concerned, they are only adequate to fool the audience and not in any way contribute towards the story. I can't believe I've been reviewing this movie for so long. For a few weeks after I watched it, my girlfriend was telling me that I need to stop talking about this movie. Then she asked me ""What were you talking about?"|0
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film.|1
"The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield . The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named Kevin who needs to build an engine for his experimental flying boat. This was my least favorite of the movies that were made from the ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" series. They all had some good points, but none of them even approached this movie's ineptitude. The plot has no potential to make it anywhere near any sort of entertaining film. In fact, I doubt that it was even possible to write the screenplay in the way that the makers intended."|0
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments , Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air . The film opens on a doctor (Clifton Webb) who has recently died in the hospital. His daughter, Sally (Diane Lane) comes to take care of her mother, but things quickly turn sour when she begins working under the nurse (Beth Meacham) that Sally just fired. It's clear early on that this film will have its problems. I'm sure there are many fans of the original show that enjoyed this movie more than me.|0
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South America, and that all the men die horribly, often in horrible ways, almost always from heart problems. I'm surprised I haven't seen this film yet. It has so many bad things about it. Let's see: the lead actor (Kenny Jones) dies at the end of the movie for no reason whatsoever, then gets resurrected and he's off again; the only other surviving characters are completely unengaging and unsympathetic; there are lots of scenes where nothing happens; etc.|0
"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin."|1
At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late.|1
That 's a bad , raunchy , predictable , tacky , salacious soap opera ? `` The Best of Everything? That's nothing ! I don't give a **** about that crap. I want to hear the best of life from some great authors. It's not what they do that makes them good writers, but rather the words they put out. This review is based upon the first five books in the original trilogy. Of course, my opinion may have changed by now as the books have been continued.|0
"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted ""Rodeo"" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style."|1
Graphics is far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to Underground. It deserves strong love. It is an insane game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even though graphics suck, thats doesn't make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES?|1
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band 's 30 year career . Lee , Keith and Steve are always great. A must see!I saw this show at a festival. It was a very hot day but the weather didn't stop me from seeing this concert. Some people complained that the set list wasn't as tight as it might've been earlier in the tour, but to be fair, these were only the opening acts. The bands actually play their full sets on most nights.|0
If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie.|1
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to see it in the theatre this night. What's interesting about it is that although it has some pretty good comedy bits, the overall story is rather thin. I found myself bored for the first half hour at least and then I got a little interested when there was an opening scene about a couple getting married. I guess it could have been entertaining, but not enough to justify its running time. First off, the premise is bad.|0
When I saw the preview for this movie , I figured to myself , `` here 's another dumb TV show .' And that was before I saw the trailer.The only reason I even went back to look again at the reviews is so I could vent my anger after reading them.If you haven't seen any of the other movies on this list, don't bother. There isn't really a single redeeming quality about these films. All are lame and stupid.I just wanted to tell the truth.This film had no redeeming features whatsoever. The characters are shallow, the dialog is cheesy, and the story has absolutely nothing to say.|0
See No Evil With Kane. The Movie Has a great storyline But it just wasn't a Hide my eye's, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it was going to be from watching the WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw When The Movie First Came To Theaters. I Did ENJOY The Movie Though I Loved The Story It Played Out.GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 It Doesn't Matter If Kane Gets Killed At The EndOr Not They Have Killed Off Other Horror Stars In Every Movie They Have Out And They Still Comeback For More So a part 2 wouldBe Very Interesting.|1
I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, nor, Richard for that matter, so I must go by how the movie portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I did see and learn of Karen, I felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. I know that I wasn't born until 1965 so I didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music.|1
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen is planning on having Cartman to be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff.|1
'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality.|1
This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their `` Erasmus year '' in Germany.I would not recommend this to someone without a lot of experience with languages.The language, although it is not German, is difficult and often incomprehensible at times. There is a little humor, but nothing too interesting. This movie is so bad that it's hard to know how anyone could watch it. The acting is awful, the plot even worse (there's no plot!). I mean...what's wrong with having fun? What's wrong with doing something you love?|0
"Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make comments about how I could have written better when I was a more mature individual, I can tell you that one of the greatest insults I ever received at work was from a co-worker. A ""good"" typist is judged not only on the content of his or her typed lines, but the amount of effort that was put into the words. In short, poor typists are regarded with disdain because they spent less time making those words flow."|0
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous chase to rescue the girl, Young loses control of himself and becomes insane. The chase leads him into a deadly maze filled with monsters and he must kill every one of them to escape. I have seen a lot of bad horror movies, but I haven't seen anything like this.It starts off by showing that it's about a girl named Claire who has been taken to an insane asylum and is being tormented by those who were supposed to care for her.|0
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like ""he's faking"". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody."|1
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (get us in). This is ""our movie"" and the music is ""our songs"". Michelle's song is ""our"" song. Yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. She is left alone with child."|1
"I'm a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. Some of the other posts are right: ""Wannabes"" isn't going to rival ""The Godfather"" for best mob film ever. On the other hand, ""Wannabes"" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. My problem with one of the other reviews:- Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians- Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman."|1
Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years . Great production design , appealing stars , good costumes and a believable plot. I am sorry to be blunt about this, but this is not the worst film ever. This is just the one that gets me up before dawn to go see it again. I have never had so many problems with a motion picture in my life. Why did they make this movie? Are we supposed to take it seriously? Or are we expected to like it simply because it is Steven Seagal?|0
I just watched this movie on it 's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia . I liked (and still do enjoy) some of the earlier movies, but I'm so glad I finally took the plunge and got this one.This is one of the best bad movies ever made. It's not as bad as a lot of the others on that list...but it's still bad.The plot is incredibly stupid and contrived. They don't even try to get across any of the important points in the story other than what is required for the plot.It takes forever for any real character development to happen.|0
`` Boy Next Door '' is a hilarious romp through male neurosis . In just over fifteen minutes , the film provides an abundance of gags and silly dialogue . From the very beginning to the final cut , the film has little to do. I thought this movie was funny at first. I didn't see anything particularly wrong with it. After watching it however, I feel that the comedy isn't so much about jokes as it is about what the people on screen are thinking or feeling. One of the main characters, Joe, spends his days in his room alone because his family has left him.|0
This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. I think that women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they act on it. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not.|1
"I got this movie with my BBC `` Jane Austen Collection '' ( 5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations ) I had a lot of interest in this movie for a couple of reasons;
this movie was very boring, it made no sense from the beginning and then it started to make sense but that was very late on in the movie. This movie didn't have any plot except that you would not be surprised if she married her husband and they had a child together. The only thing that I can say about the movie was that it was quite depressing, it really left a bad after-taste after the first hour."|0
In Mississippi , the former blues man Lazarus ( Samuel L. Jackson ) is in crisis , missing his wife and two children, who are now grown and have moved back home. At first he is angry at the world for ignoring him, but then he starts to get some answers that will change his opinion .The problem with this film is there isn't really a story here. It just kind of exists as an exercise in slow-motion. I can't say I've ever liked slow motion in movies. I was surprised by this movie.|0
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film,or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future.|1
"This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is . This is the true story of one woman and one man's relationship--a ""romance"" if you will--that took place during World War II. It is not a particularly moving or inspiring tale.The main character is played by John Gielgud who is pretty much unknown at the time. The movie starts when he is in his twenties and is trying to win over a girl to marry him. He tries everything possible to win her attention, but she always rejects him."|0
For my money , probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford is a part of. It is, frankly, a superb piece of cinema. I don't think I've ever heard anybody else describe it quite so fondly and to this day I cannot imagine a more fitting tribute to his talent for directing.I can't tell you what makes it special, although I have no doubt that it is inextricably linked to two factors (one being Ford's ability to craft beautiful, mesmerising films from a simple set).|0
"This movie is VERY LONG , but totally worth splitting up over several nights . It has an all-star cast, which makes it better and worse than you'd think at the same time. I wish I hadn't been so desperate for something to do on a Sunday afternoon that I didn't bother to look up any of the actors' names--I just remember them as ""the guys"" and ""the other guy's"".The story lines are too thin to make much of a suspenseful plot, especially when they are all set in America."|0
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a ""family saga"" rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion."|1
In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.|1
Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits with a giant, evil chicken who calls itself the Chicken Man. In both this cartoon and the second (see below), Bugs does everything to stop the Chicken Man from abducting his friend Daffy's girlfriend, only to get captured himself and made a prisoner by the Chicken Man. I'll admit it, I had high expectations for this film after hearing so many good things about it, however I must say that my expectations turned out to be way too high.|0
"It came before ""the ten commandments"" ""land of the Pharaohs"" ""Ben Hur"" and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel ,it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari,whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books ""the secret of the kingdom"" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land)."|1
"What can I say ? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception. MESSIAH could easily have been made as a feature film - but we were told it couldn't be, even though there is nothing stopping it now. We were also told that it was too dark (which it is) and had to be ""made for TV"" which makes absolutely no sense at all. There is some good acting in this film, but most of it is wasted. The dialogue is almost non-existent."|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time . I believe that if you just watch this series as a viewer, you will feel very sorry for the poor characters and you will be moved to tears at times (the same can be said for any good TV series from the 70's). It has some of the funniest moments in TV history ! If you like Family Guy, you would probably like Dad Army, but maybe not as much as most. When I first saw the show I enjoyed it; I thought it was pretty decent.|0
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job Mr. Lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! Though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! Overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars!|1
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well.All too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre.|1
I 'm certain that people from USA do n't know anything about the rest of the world , but I just don't get it . Why is this show so terrible? This was one of those movies that you watch when you have your friends over, and they're bored or something, and you find yourself with an hour to kill on a Saturday night. The premise is dumb, the script has some problems, the actors suck, the effects look like they came from a crappy VHS tape, and the ending is downright ridiculous (the movie ends with the main character coming back for revenge).|0
Awww, I love this! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon doesn't really need an synopsis, as that's what it is... the cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. It's the artistry that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year (2005)... yeah, almost same thing, which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off.But this is a really good short, with stark black & white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction...|1
This game is very good for the n64 . You can skate as Tony Hawk , Bob Burnquist , Steve Yzerman , or Wayne Gretzky to name a few . It has a nice graphics and the gameplay is interesting and challenging . I like that you can customize your character, because some of them are cool . I have no idea why anyone would go out and spend money on this game. The game was not worth it and I gave up after only about 5 minutes of play. I'm surprised this game was put out by THQ.|0
"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was ""not very profound."" I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die."|1
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Artistic license, historical inaccuracies, gender and class issues to the more subtle interpretations which focus on a theme of sexuality. I'm not going to get into that here but I think it's important to consider how the Tempest is meant to be read and what are its original intentions. At first glance this movie looks pretty good (it is actually filmed well), but after a while, things begin to show through. The acting is uneven between the two lead characters.|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made ..... Realistic . Movies were not candy for us back then .... I hope someone will put this movie to the test ... and let everyone know that movies were much more realistic than they have been over the past 70 years. This movie would be a better movie if it had no blood and gore at all. It's like something out of 'Halloween 3' or 'The Ring 2'. After seeing the preview of this film, I wasn't expecting much.|0
"Enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives is the subplot. Wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairstylist that ""a little dab will do ya!"""|1
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason..that is until the Lone Ranger discovers from a conversation with the Indian Chief Tomache that each man possessed a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it?|1
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film 's lead character's name; Fyrework. I guess they thought it would make the film sound edgy but in hindsight, it was quite stupid. It also seems to take itself very seriously (especially the music) and tries too hard to create some sort of tension. I found this movie to be incredibly boring. It really lacked anything going for it. It didn't have the sense of fun and adventure that movies like This Boy's Life or Little Shop of Horrors could provide.|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas , Phoenix , Fresno , etc. , just single buildings with the name of the local airport on top of it.The other thing is, this show has been around for about a year and there is a huge gap in terms of characters between the beginning and end of the show. That's really saying something! Wow! What a terrible first hour of a TV drama series. There was no chemistry between anyone in the house at any time, the only good moment was when Charlie got drunk, and that was also after the fact.|0
Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements . I think they were trying to capture what you 'd expect from a film like this, but i think they got it half way. There's a bit where two people walk up to a house and talk to the owners about something. Then one of them takes a look out the window... And there's a very brief scene of a girl looking at her phone. Not only that, but another girl with long hair is seen walking towards the house.... This movie has absolutely nothing to do with reality.|0
It's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring.|1
"Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts , unlike many other great Ford films , like The Green Berets
I remember watching this when I was a little girl, it was one of those movies that you watched just because it was so much fun. However, after reading the synopsis I was very disappointed. I found the acting uninspired, and the plot didn't even come close to what had been promised. I mean, did they forget to mention the fact that there would be a war between the Turks and the Mongols?? This movie is terrible."|0
* * SPOILERS AHEAD * * It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch such a poor film quality. I don't understand how this could have been green-lit, not only because of the horrible editing (which leads one to think it was made with a VCR rather than the original tape), but because of the sheer horribleness of the plot and dialog. My friends and I bought this movie last week. We've seen plenty of horror flicks before, but none as bad as this one!|0
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done.|1
Enjoyable film that gives you romance , women-on-the-verge psychodrama , work place sexual harassment , adultery , and fashion . A lot of the problems this film has with its portrayal of women is due to a lack of character development. In the beginning, I was excited by this film as it may have given us a little insight on the lives of the characters. As the story moved forward, I found the characters flat, predictable, and very much lacking any real depth.There are several points in this film that are disturbing. First of all, two of these women had an affair with each other when they were married.|0
"Usually , Alan Alda plays characters that are too `` soft '' and overly verbal -- it 's probably how he got his start in Hollywood but he's been able to maintain his image as a funny guy by doing more serious work. I saw the movie in the theaters at about 2:30 in the afternoon. I was exhausted and had to sleep in my hotel room overnight. What is with all the ""hype""? I watched this movie not expecting much from it considering it's an hour and 17 minutes long, but what could I have hoped for?"|0
Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / did n't understand this wonderful film . What a sad life he must lead ! I will tell you why this movie is bad. It has to do with the director and writer/producer. They decided to make a low budget movie because it would be hard to get financing for a high budget movie. They couldn't afford to hire any actors, which is probably why there are not many good performances. I guess that's what happens when you decide to make a movie without an original story or characters. This is one of those rare cases.|0
Sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. Splendid villains  you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one  both good and bad. Secondary story lines also are well developed. Several cameos by major stars of past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics.|1
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.|1
Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe , grappa , aramangac or jungle juice some of them got the bright idea to make a Bollywood comedy. In my humble opinion, this should have been made by 'Honeymoon in Vegas' (which also starred Peter Finch). I'm not a huge fan of the director but he was at least trying his hand at comedy. But the script is absolutely ridiculous and there's so much wrong with it. In the first act, when the wife complains about being treated like a bitch by her husband/father, you'll know that your in trouble.|0
This was on odd film . I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children.The characters are not original and their dialog is cliched. Some scenes are also overly sentimental. It's about an old man who decides to try and save his son from a witch who has killed many of his friends. Not as good as the first one or even the third, but if you can overlook all that, this will be worth your money. The main thing I disliked about this sequel isn't so much the plot as it is the acting.|0
First of all , ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans . Everyone is doing it . That's why it's on TV. People are sick and tired of them and they're acting up, like in The Last Jedi or the latest Hollywood film. It has been said that America's greatest comedy is its greatest nightmare. If true, this must surely rank high on that list.The entire premise of South Park is absurd. Kids run around a small town killing people, with the exception of two characters who try to stop them.|0
"Great Movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song ""Honey Roll"" and poem ""I Meant To Do My Work Today"" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film!"|1
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy. This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife.|1
Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie.|1
I'm certain that people from USA don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the USA. The only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the USA and Islamic nations. In France, for instance, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it's 14. In Spain it's 12. So the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal.|1
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song."|1
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. If you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.This is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it.|1
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short . Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a response. The film has no plot, nor do we hear any of the characters. I found this film so irritating that I thought I was going mad when I watched it. After being thoroughly bored with all the films I've been forced to sit through this one I did what I think most people do at times when they get their mind set on something; I turned it off and wrote a comment on my screen saying 'This is the worst film I've ever seen'.|0
"Fata Morgana is , by far , one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen.The movie starts out looking like any other film from the 60's, a beautiful woman in an extremely sexy dress enters a man's house and then he falls asleep. She wakes him up and after a long conversation she reveals that she can see ghosts in her sleep. If you are thinking ""this is not that sort of thing"" then you are correct. The film starts off with an attractive woman waking her man up from a nap."|0
"This is a `` revised '' Riverdance presentation , staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City . The film was intended to be broadcast, but they decided to cancel the event because of bad publicity about the sexual content . I saw this movie when it came out and I can safely say that it does not deliver on any of the hype or promises given. Let's see, where do I start? I've been watching ""The Riverdance Project"" for the past couple of years. And now I must say...this movie wasn't so bad!"|0
Do n't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you ? I've watched this for years and I'm always confused. The story is not that great, but the actors are alright. But then there is the plot. There's nothing much to tell about the plot. You get an idea from one of the characters in the film, but it doesn't matter. It's hard to figure out what's going to happen.The acting is horrible as well. I can't believe how bad they are.|0
"""The Cell"" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, ""a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim"", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing."|1
Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality.|1
See No Evil With Kane . The Movie Has a great storyline But it just was n't a Hide my Kids. If there is anything in this movie that makes the viewer cringe it must be the lack of believability on the part of the film-makers. It is hard not to feel for the characters, since we can easily empathize with their emotional state when faced with real world problems like losing one's job, dealing with a broken marriage and having to start a new life all on their own. Yet, once again, they never seem to have the ability to come up with a solution.|0
Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native Italy. His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.)|1
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film . It was when I was a teenager ,and I don't think many people really know it.It seems like a silly movie that had a lot of potential, but sadly went down the drain in the 90's and has been almost forgotten in the 20+ years since.This is just such a dumb piece of shit that I can't wait to see it all again on DVD. You've seen movies with bad special effects, bad scripts, and bad acting. You've also seen movies with good special effects, good scripts, and good acting.|0
If you want to see a movie with nudity , sex , drugs , alcohol , brutal beating of a woman & murder of an old man this is a good choice, but its not the worst movie i have ever seen. It is more like a horror movie than a thriller. The acting is so bad they were making jokes about it instead of having fun on the screen. I'm no big fan of horror movies. They tend to fall into a lot of clichés that really don't leave me much to be scared by.|0
"Although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...I just HAD to live in New York. It has great opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis crooning ""Romance is still...the best of everything..."" that rival those of West Side Story. There is a rather stilted performance by the world's REAL first Supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry about that, Janice D.), but it's great eye-candy!"|1
Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all.|1
then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man.|1
Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and it's among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison.|1
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. In addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.Highly recommended.|1
This movie just might make you cooooo . The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town . Betty's character was a total bimbo ( and this is a good thing ) . I didn't like much of the plot line but at least they gave it their best shot . There are several films out there that are similar to this one. They all start with some girl getting raped by a mysterious guy. She gets scared, runs from the guy, and has to escape in order to get to safety. When she wakes up, she finds herself at a very important place.|0
"I too saw this movie when it first came out . I was a teenager at the time , and it got me all excited to see what other movies there might be. And then about 5 hours later, another film came along that caught my interest more . That movie was called ""The Last Starfighter"" and it was the best movie I had ever seen . This movie is not as bad as the title suggests. The story lines are somewhat interesting, the performances are very average, the special effects are OK, and the acting is fairly good (though nothing amazing)."|0
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: the Music Hall..I know what is and what is not associated with the New York venue. The film's Theodore is just the ""Music Hall."" No Rockettes are in the film. Only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. Just thought you would like to know. Truly a wonderful film. You will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating."|1
"Brilliant film ! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats only because I don't like this type of films, even if I know nothing about the subject. ""This Is 40"" takes a page out of ""In the Loop"" and ""Thelma and Louise"" as it revolves around two people whose relationship has hit rock bottom. They're living on their own with no money (with the aid of family) and are trying to make ends meet while still looking for a place in society."|0
This is what porn used to be , this is a true classic . I mean , it is an amazing film and I have no doubt in my mind that all the people involved with the making of this film felt they had really done their best . It doesn't look as if it was edited for any obvious reason apart from sheer boredom .It is one of those movies where you go, 'what on earth did they do here' ? I don't understand what the point of this film is. It's just a bad movie.|0
Strange enough , shorts like this get a 10 . Why ? They are hilarious . This is hilarious . The jokes are so crude and cringey . It is sad to see such bad comedies coming out in the 90's but they were funny then as well.This film was pretty awful . Too many plot holes, too many inconsistencies . Well here's an interesting idea, if you're bored of your regular TV channels, give it a try. I started watching it around the 6 hour mark, and I couldn't have been more than 50 minutes in at that point.|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years....But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army?|1
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. You don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. The jokes are quick and unexpected.|1
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a possibility of a good thing. Its not an amazing film but just a movie to make you laugh. I have never read the books nor seen the films but from what was in the review, I think this movie made me curious about the source material.The story is interesting, intriguing, and at times entertaining. But the problem I had with this film is that most of the dialogues and events are completely unrealistic and without any depth whatsoever. This leads to the plot becoming very confusing.|0
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin . There are n't much left when they get there: some old buildings, a few streets, and a bridge. I'd heard of this film but thought it wasn't as good as other Scandinavian ones I'd seen. Well, it is a total disappointment. You might think that Sweden's best feature film director would make something more interesting with this time in his career. But instead, you get one boring movie about a couple who lose their daughter in an accident while traveling.|0
"I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years . I rate it one of the most funny TV shows of all time, and one of my all time favs. There is absolutely no reason to watch ""King of Queens"", other than to see Norm Macdonald again, and if he can't make it work, well...that's OK. A few laughs were had, but they were totally forced.The only redeeming feature of the film is Tim Matheson. He appears to be in high demand these days, appearing in countless movies, mainly westerns and horror films."|0
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award . The story was a complete non-event for me. I found the acting laughable, especially for such a big name. I also thought the movie was way too predictable and did not allow for some good twists or unexpected turns. I really don't understand how they could have gone so far to make this crap out of what is supposed to be a very interesting story about a group of boys who decide to leave home for a vacation after their parents are killed during a zombie apocalypse.|0
"When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door , I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling . On the one hand, I'm sad to have passed by this film. This is the kind of movie that leaves me longing for someone to say it's really good. What do you want from me ? I know what you're thinking right now. ""What are YOU saying about 'Boy Next Door' ?"" No, I'm not saying anything. I don't know why people write these comments. Maybe some of them can't read English or maybe they're just looking for something to say."|0
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the Justin and Madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine, and accurate. The costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. I dearly love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American History, and I love movies about it.|1
"what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person 's past ? this movie makes me ashamed of the Catholic Church ! The only good point is that the actors look like real priests and nuns, except for the priest who didn't do a good job as Father Cervone. There are some good lines from one of the characters in the movie such as 'I know you're here to save me'. There's no doubt that ""Lovers on the Loose"" is one of the most entertaining (and controversial) films of the 1980s."|0
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of ""We've Only Just Begun"" and Karen's marriage troubles admirably (the ""Superstar"" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitar solos, etc. Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter's personality."|1
I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with `` Valley of the Kings . '' These movies were great and I'm sure that people will like this.The plot is not very deep. It's all about love, war, sex, politics, religion, and many other things. This film has no interest for most people. I remember seeing this as a teenager. Now, I feel sorry for me. This movie was horrible. It had absolutely nothing going for it at all. The story was laughable and the script was boring.|0
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just a rip off, i have seen this movie more than 4 times now, and that is all i could ever ask. I don't know why people still bother watching movies like this, they were made for teenagers and college aged kids. It's not very well directed either. A group of American boys travel to Berlin to attend a German summer camp. The film is divided into seven scenes, each set during different days of the week.|0
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition.|1
"Cant believe it .... after all these years finally tracked this down .. it was meant to be named 'The Last Of the Mohicans'
A very good, very good movie, one of the first in the series and it is also a must see! There are a few scenes where it does not hold up well for the rest of the movie or at least I did. This movie has some of the best special effects in any movie I've ever seen, they really are top shelf! The story starts out pretty good but it goes downhill as the movie becomes more and more predictable."|0
Yes , this is one of the better done television movies and I would n't expect less from Joe Sargent. I think there were only 3 episodes that had any meaning, the others were just thrown together. There was supposed to be a scene in the middle of the show with a character getting shot. No matter if it was intended or not it didn't do much for the story. It was more annoying than anything. The main thing that made this show enjoyable was the humor. Some of the best gags I've ever seen (and laugh at) come from this show.|0
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos 's role as Williams for that entire show , was Emmy worthy and a very good thing for the show. This series is so boring it's almost hard to believe that it has any value whatsoever, especially if you've seen the actual movies. First off let me say that at the same time we are watching this show we are getting a bunch of crap like The Hangover Part II (The only redeeming quality of this show), Z Nation, Sharknado, Bad Santa 2, A Walk to Remember, iZombie and more.|0
"First of all - I 'm not one to go all sappy over movies . I saw Friends in the cinema and it was a decent film as well but it wasn't very good either. It wasn't exactly ""great"" either (I mean it was pretty good). The first thing that stuck me out about this movie was the title. So, apparently there's a subgenre of horror movies where the people are being killed by something they don't even know exists. Is this possible? Sure, I guess so. Then I thought, what is the subgenre called?"|0
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration ( and music ) . I have seen all three films and none of them was very good. This is an example of how poor production values combined with bad writing and terrible acting can result in an incredibly boring movie. Let me start by saying, I loved this film! But that just wasn't good enough...The only reason I haven't deleted my VHS copy and moved it into a closet is because I knew I'd see it again years from now. In other words, I would have no choice.|0
Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it 's rabbit season . But why do we care? Because this is an episode full of the kind of campy humor that has been the hallmark of the entire series to date.The plot goes off the rails around the midway point, and there's not much else to be said. The whole affair is really just a rehash of the first film. I was lucky enough to sit in on the DVD release at the Cinefamily theater last week. I was so excited about seeing this movie that I didn't want to show it to anybody.|0
This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ! I was not a fan of the movie but i must say that i am glad that it was made! The acting was so bad that i wondered if there was someone who had done an impression of David Spade on the set . Oh, what a ripoff! What a horrible film! A bunch of teenagers get into fights and end up in jail, all while their parents stand by, clueless to what is really happening. Oh well, I guess it is better than watching a bunch of kids go through juvenile delinquency.|0
Wow! An amazing, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. This film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. As a retelling of the Oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. The chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This film used to be double featured with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is.|1
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom.|1
I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago . I 've seen it 4 more times since then and i cant believe they made this movie ! Its not a good movie and doesnt deserve to be shown to people . The main problem is its so slow that you wont care about the characters or the story . It just makes u wonder what happened to the original director , David Lynch ? It really doesn't get any worse than this film. The cast was pretty, if a little bland. The plot was unoriginal, although there were parts of it which were interesting enough.|0
"With all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on ""Romeo and Juliet""? Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to them.Yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. Eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it."|1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film. The writing was well done and there were no boring plot holes. It all came together nicely with some decent effects (although I can't quite remember any). The acting was fine and the director did an OK job. As far as the script goes it was great, but the story line and character development didn't come together very well for me.The ending was pretty disappointing. If you're into Sci-Fi action flicks this is not the right movie for you.|0
"""Americans Next Top Model"" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.I kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, I did blink) It can be sad, funny, or addicting. (mostly addicting)""America's Next Top Model"" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series!"|1
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!This short will bring lots of laughs.|1
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much . This is one of the best, and if you are in need of a great show with a strong female character then this is the perfect series. If you aren't going to buy it , then don't look at my review. I've watched the original series from the BBC, and I think I can confidently say it has not aged well. It just isn't good enough anymore. The only good thing about it is that some of the characters are still charming.|0
Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door Jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys try their best to locate Jimmy, meaning no more Jimmy if they get their hands on him.|1
On watching this film , I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity's personality, but in this case it has failed. If you are a horror buff or even just a movie buff who wants to watch another slasher movie that doesn't feature the same type of killer, then this should be right up your alley. The first thing that strikes you about this is the acting. There is only one performance that really takes you into the movie. In other words...the rest of the actors aren't doing much.|0
Just watched Conrack for the first time . Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it was still a good action film. The story itself is pretty straightforward, and I can see how some of the more casual viewers (including myself) may enjoy it. If you want to go see a great Sci-Fi/action film but are on the fence, I would recommend this one. It's definitely not an action blockbuster, but it might be your next favorite movie. Now here's my problem with this movie. It wasn't bad, by all means.|0
"There are many film now on DVD, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. Many people from my generation learn a lot about history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas, (The first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome seen many ""bad"" epics of the era."|1
Fantastic documentary. A movie within a movie. I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation.|1
"I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see."|1
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be British, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. Not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended.|1
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. The gangsters, (led by Bryan Brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. That's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. But this mob tickle your funny bone as well. A clever structured script by Jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes and behavior of America's past and those of a group of misfits in the present. These are three young men (two of which are white, one of which is Hispanic) with dreams of being rock stars. Two of them get caught up in an accident and have to fight for survival in the real-life version of New Orleans, Louisiana. I watched this movie last night. I couldn't find any information on it on the net but I thought that it was probably worth checking out.|0
"One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film . To have it take you somewhere you might never have thought was possible. It is not always an easy journey , but it is enjoyable nonetheless. This is the case with 'The Man Who Knew Infinity'. It has been described as sci-fi, fantasy, coming-of-age, romance, thriller or thriller-with-magic. I call it ""The Man From Earth"", because if I could have picked only one thing from this film it would be this: ""How did we get here? ""."|0
Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post Saved By The Bell acting? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is right to give this movie a `10' rating? Hahahahahaha... that's funny. This movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than I expected it to be. Made-for-TV movies are often so so so similar. So many of them have the same feel to them. This one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story.|1
This game is very good for the n64. You can skate as Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, and maybe some more skaters. The game doesn't have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. The level School II is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes.|1
I lack cable-vision and no longer have `` DirecTV '' . So being a rural resident I have to wait till they start using it in other towns. On one night, the news was showing a couple getting into a fight while out walking on a trail. Then there was a report of a woman driving drunk and hit her husband (with a rock). All of these incidents took place in the state of Vermont. The man had been mauling the woman as they were hiking. In an effort to prove their point that she must be mentally ill, the reporters tried to provoke her into attacking them.|0
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years . As a boy , I remember it being the best show on television at that time. We had no such thing as video tape players and there was no TV. When I first saw the movie, all I could say to myself was ""how could they pull this off?"" Now I know why.The acting is amateurish . Some of the actors don't even do their own lines ! I watched this film several times growing up, so I have a very good idea of what to expect."|0
comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.But like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality.|1
Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor.|1
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story  Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona  you predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure.|1
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time.|1
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely.I like The Gilmore Girls but I am not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson).|1
"It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about . Or , maybe I should rephrase that . To tell somebody what Fata Morgana IS. I've been told by friends that this movie was ""like the worst of all time"". I have yet to see it, although I am going to rent it when I get home. At any rate, if you're looking for a horror movie with a bunch of annoying teenagers (not that there's anything wrong with that, but still), look elsewhere."|0
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network T.V. I think I was like 9. (Picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remembered,it's really good,scary flick. I think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a ****load of sequels i.e. Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better.|1
"In ""Black Snake Moan,"" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into ""Happy Ending"" territory for my liking)."|1
Hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both.|1
Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic `` Alive '' , there were two films that really captured my imagination - the first one, which I only watched a little while back and can't quite remember its title, was made by John Huston. The film is about a group of young boys who go to live in a house inhabited by an old woman. The place turns out to be a den of sadomasochistic perverts. I've been meaning to review this film for a long time.|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had its strong points.|1
"Recently I saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I imagine this?Or, is this part of the ""clean up"" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not ""appropriate""?I love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and I and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together."|1
Based on Mika Waltari 's Book , This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color , beautiful costumes and a great atmosphere.The film tells the tale of three men who are trying to stop a man who had killed one of their friends. They discover him in his living room, watching TV and eating chips. The premise of these movies is always interesting. A guy gets involved in some shady deal, but he can't figure out how the person he was supposed to be killing could have been involved in such a scheme. So he tries to work it out with the same old characters.|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission, I can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year) but once I'd started I had to watch to the end.The down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. All the way through, I wished I was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice.|1
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great Actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that sometime that the Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a Car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much.|1
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies , along with Spaceballs ( although I will openly admit there are some serious flaws in that one) and Blazing Saddles. My only real complaint about this movie is how long it lasts - it's like an extra episode of a television series, rather than the whole thing. I have to admit that I had forgotten about this film from my childhood until reading the excellent reviews on IMDb. At first I was confused because I didn't recognize this as a sequel to Spaceballs or Blazing Saddles.|0
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overall view. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short. But, having said that, watching Colin Dunne is nevertheless gratifying. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, changes from the original Dublin production are evident. ""Trading Taps"" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion."|1
"It happens often, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a youth. It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled ""The Egyptian."" Audience were awed with the sets, costumes and great acting of this film, so much so, other films soon followed in like vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions."|1
In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once.|1
"Pat Conroy's autobiographical book ""The Water Is Wide"" proves to be something of a Southern ""Up The Down Staircase"", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, ""Conrack"" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. The one actual actress in the bunch (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the ""tough nut"" Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze."|1
Hands down , the best drama/comedy show on television . A cleverly written show about a young mother and her three kids. This show has a great balance of funny, touching, and heartwarming moments . I can't believe I finally watched this show when it first went on air. I had been a huge fan of Will & Grace ever since the original series and I really enjoyed watching every episode. The second season however, wasn't that good. I've seen worse on TV. The storyline was kind of lame. There were not enough funny scenes in the show.|0
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dancing, music and choreography! The leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing! May they always keep shining and keep dancing. Their on stage chemistry was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will be. Long Live Riverdance!|1
"The four signs on the road say `` If You 're Looking For Fun ..... You Do n't Need A Driver''
Well I'm not a motorist, but from the looks of it i don't think that is a very fun thing to see. The guy at the sign seems to be trying to pick up his girlfriend, she seems to be pretty drunk. This film is full of bad decisions. First they show the driver getting in a car with 2 other men, well if you get in a car with 1 girl and 4 guys you're going to have some interesting stories to tell."|0
Obsessed ! ! ! ! ! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love them so much is that they were all about two people in a town where everyone else was an idiot. The world of Gilmore Girls was filled with people like Rory and Lorelai. I'm going to be blunt here. This show was awful. I don't mean that it wasn't pretty. It was, and I liked the costumes. I thought they were adorable. So cute. But the plots and character development just weren't there.|0
This film had me spellbound this evening. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted. John Voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane?|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year . It was a truly moving experience . I had so much sadness for the family and those poor souls that lost their loved one. I felt like I was watching a documentary of someone's life . I think this is one of the greatest films ever made, but it's got a lot of shortcomings. The performances of the actors are quite good, the music is very fitting, and all the characters are well played. The acting could have been more believable and some scenes (such as the one in the hotel) were badly filmed.|0
I loved this movie ! OH MY GOSH ! This movie rocked so hard ! I found it amongst some DVDs from my old home. I was amazed to see how much the movie has gone through since it was released. Not just the music and acting (of course) but the editing as well. What a nightmare !!! The best part of the movie was that it made me really laugh out loud several times. This movie was awful. My friends and I rented it together because we had no choice, and we thought it might get better.|0
"I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. Most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. I saw the ""twist"" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie.But what really stood out to me was the direction."|1
Gosh , I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again in your teens you can't remember how it is like back then, especially the first time. I have been searching for this movie forever. I finally found it on Netflix and tried to watch it. I didn't get past the first two minutes. It had nothing to do with the original story. If they really wanted to re-tell the story they could have used the same actors, but they did not.|0
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store and i bought it for 4 bucks and still keep it on my shelf because i don't think there is better movie like this in cinema! Just watched this film tonight and thought I'd write a review...I'm a HUGE fan of the 70's/80's Sci-fi series ""Dune"" and this film is pretty much all that could be expected. However, the acting is terrible and the plot is boring. There are so many things that make no sense at all and none of them made any sense whatsoever."|0
GREAT , Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen .. He acts like he's so old, he sounds like he's in his mid 40's or something. He has a really bad accent. And he doesn't even play the part that well! I was at a screening of this movie last night and there were a lot of people talking about it. It wasn't just me. All around me people were asking their friends what they thought of it. So I sat up front and had a chat with a number of people.|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works.|1
When this film gets it right it really gets it right . And when it goes wrong ... I 'd rather be a fly in that ointment than watch it.The story of this movie has been done before. It has been done better. The plot is weak and doesn't hold its own weight. This movie is very disappointing. It's not bad, but it certainly is nothing special or unique about it. At times it even seems like the script writers forgot to make a good movie and just made a cheap copy of another one.|0
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. The films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. One obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good.|1
"Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece . It 's Werner Herzog 's most unconventional film . It does n't have the grandeur of other Herzog's work , it is more subtle and complex. Its plot is based around two lovers , who go to see a great play, where one of them is about to die. When you hear the word ""movie"" in the phrase ""pornography"", you automatically assume something that would be viewed as obscene or degrading. That's not true at all. This film is actually a very good example of what people should be able to get away with."|0
it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in Romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :D i love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked Dean too, but Logan is best.|1
Forget about the plot of this movie . Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Keira Knightley. The only reason anyone would watch this movie is to see two beautiful women making each other feel uncomfortable. You know, I was hoping for a really good romantic comedy but alas, I was sadly disappointed. This movie could have gone so far in terms of characterization, but as it stands, it's not much to get excited about. The movie starts off with Keira Knightley and Vince Vaughn having a heated argument on their flight to Los Angeles.|0
This film , released in 1951 , has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50 's: horses, Indians and guns. The actors are well-known Western stars such as Gary Cooper, Vincent Price and Richard Brooks, and the story involves a tribe who live in the mountains.The plot is good. It's not so much about fighting Indians, as it is about survival. What does this movie have to say to us today? A bunch of American cowboys find themselves faced with the prospect of their lives being destroyed by a small band of Indians who will stop at nothing to kill them.|0
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80 's on network T.V . I think I was like 9 years old, it's a lot of fun to watch and you can tell what people are thinking as long as they keep repeating themselves. I went to see this one at the theater with some friends, and we all really thought it was great--but for some reason, we kept wishing we could actually see it instead of merely hearing about it. (It was playing on TV!) It was very slow and boring.|0
"I like movies that show real people ""Americans"" and tell truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that it's USA/Canda but the box states ""All Regions"". I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it."|1
"Do n't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . This time the script is just plain terrible.The movie tries to be a political allegory about poverty and wealth inequality, but all it does is insult both. As I sat down to watch this movie today, I was reminded of the old TV show ""Chutes and Ladders"". The first two episodes have been pulled from Youtube due to copyright issues, but that's okay! If you enjoy watching people on ladders climb up them, then you'll like this movie."|0
"When I saw the preview for this movie, I figured to myself, ""here's another dumb TV movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera,"" but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Now and Again's Eric Close) but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community."|1
If there's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other, It's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. Besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by Marvin Miller, pretty much everything. And it won the Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1950. Glad to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how awesome!|1
"""Boy Next Door"" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. If you thought all he could do was play ""Bull"" the bailiff on ""Night Court"", think again."|1
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn up for the movie. Going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. A great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma's part. Shabana Azmi a divorcée who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister.|1
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom , which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of people and showed them how good they were at something. The writing was so poor I almost believed it wasn't scripted! It's just plain stupid, no humor, nothing. The characters were like cardboard cut out dolls who had never done anything to make us laugh. What is there about this character that you want to watch over and over? There's no depth in this character at all. All they have to do is turn on the light and he's gone.|0
"This comment discusses ""North and South Book I"" dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen."|1
Ok , maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies . But that 's because it did n't have any of these.The plot revolves around two sides who are trying to stop the other side from capturing and taking over their territory. I don't know how they could have screwed this up. This is an excellent western. Good actors, good production values, solid direction. There's just something not right about this film. And what is wrong? It starts off very strong with some fantastic action scenes featuring great guns. Then things get a lot less fun after that.|0
"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience.It is interesting how the film balances the message that ""one should not generalize"" with the notion that ""for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth"". For example, the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well-known Italian stereotype."|1
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld and Friends. I'm sorry to say this, but I thought Friends was really funny before Seinfeld's popularity took it to another level. It's easy to understand why this show has gotten such low ratings compared to what other sitcoms like Family Ties, Mork and Mindy, and others do. There's nothing about it that makes it unique or particularly funny. At least those shows try to have a little bit of comedy going on while dealing with real life issues.|0
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, Land of the Pharaohs"". The sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so ""neat"" in the production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have yet to see the 1999 movie ""The Mummy but am sure I will love it!"|1
"This was an excellent show . It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron ( who is still on the air here) saying something along the lines of ""I'm sorry, but it's time for you to go... You're no good."" I saw this show during its run on WGN2. I went into it as a fan of The Munsters and my expectations were very low. But after about ten minutes or so, I changed my tune and thought that maybe this might be a worthy follow-up to the classic movie."|0
"i love this movie . is it on air anymore ? what can i do to get it on air ? This film, written and directed by Robert Ludlum, was made at the end of the 1960s. He had been working for decades on books that would be considered ""bestsellers"" back then. Now in today's terms, his work might have been more accurately called a ""classic"", or even a ""classics"".The story is rather unbelievable, especially because of the title. If you're expecting some type of horror thriller, you'll be left disappointed."|0
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent , unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters . In the film, the lead male character (played by Paul Sorvino) is an amnesiac and appears to be in a psychotic state, yet there is something about his character that is endearing . The story unfolds through flashbacks, so we don't have to guess what is really happening, but it's still a bit confusing. How can anyone give this movie 1 star? It's the worst movie I have ever seen! There are times when you want to puke from the sheer pain of this movie.|0
This film blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot. After watching this, I see I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. It's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. It was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper.|1
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood, the whole thing just seemed unreal. This was one of the first movies I ever watched with my own eyes. I didn't think much of it when I first saw it, but as I started to watch again and thought about it, I couldn't believe it had such a low score on RottenTomatoes!!! How could that be? There's absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. It's actually very good, especially for a teen-movie.|0
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox 's reluctance to release a film which is so openly offensive. I have to admit that it was a really nice surprise when I realized that The Manchurian Candidate was actually released last week. But even more surprisingly (to me) than the good news was hearing some of the reviews. It's hard to figure out exactly why they think it's a good movie. First off, there's very little mystery about the character of John McClane. There's not much going on with him and there's not much happening either.|0
Well.....I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVD's yet). Boy....was I surprised!!|1
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out!|1
When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot.|1
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect . Here Alice is a normal little girl who can see what happens to animals as they grow and age. At first she is frightened but as she sees her mother being abused by an old man she gradually comes to love him and learns to care for him. This is one of those films that has a huge amount of potential. The production values are high in some areas, but the story line is terribly weak. There is not really any suspense or tension, it's all very predictable and cliched.|0
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :D It's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings.|1
Unfortunately , I 've never seen the full version of this movie . I did see the 87-minute version twice , but both times I was disappointed in the plot. I also felt let down by the actors who appeared in it . I watched this on cable TV, which has a bad track record when it comes to producing quality horror movies. So I'm glad that I didn't spend $9.99 for a two-movie weekend pass to pay for it.It should have ended at any point between the first and second film, but there is an unspeakable evil lurking in the woods.|0
"I don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, ""that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS"". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. I must tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision."|1
This one started excellently . The photography and audio are the best I 've experienced in years ( okay , maybe a couple of other years but nothing spectacular ). The story was very well done and there was not much mystery to it . It seemed more like an episode of American Gladiators. The most boring film i watched this season so far. There are two reasons for me to hate this movie. One: the actors are all horrible. How can they do that bad acting when they know what they are talking about?? ?|0
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta , where they screened the previous movie. We decided to try and watch it together, hoping we would enjoy ourselves more than the people who had gone in with us. The only reason I say this is because the movie wasn't good at all. We were lucky enough to be able to see it on a large screen, but it was nothing more than a low budget B-Movie that barely made me want to cry. The acting was awful.|0
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.We will enjoy the movie again!|1
America 's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense . It has a great hostess , a great cast , and a great theme song that will never tire of reminding you this is TV. This show is so bad it's funny. One thing I do like to do with myself is watch something really bad. So when I decided to watch The Bachelor season 22 last night, I had no expectations. And I was not disappointed. At the beginning of the episode, I knew my favorite girl was coming back, but I didn't know who her new boyfriend was going to be.|0
One of the best! As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.|1
"I 'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film . If you have a weak stomach and are looking for a fun, entertaining movie , check it out . If you don't like action movies or just don't care about anything in particular , maybe you'll enjoy this one too.The problem with the film is that the writers/director seem to believe that a good movie should have no surprises at all (as if the audience couldn't figure everything out before watching). The thing that most people hate about John Woo is his ""shoot 'em up"" style films."|0
- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying . In their escape , one of them escapes through an underground tunnel, where he meets a woman and his two sons . They all travel together to a town where the boys' father resides . I really can't think of too much more to say about this piece of crap. I don't get what made the creators of this film think that there would be a market here for such a low budget flick. The movie starts off as a cheesy thriller with bad special effects (and dialogue) but quickly becomes silly and boring.|0
I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field.|1
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago.|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years , Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of film making since the 1970's. Her films are a constant reminder of where cinema should be going and it never fails to entertain. But what is even more inspiring about this movie is the fact that Herzog was a fan of Douglas Sirk's films from the mid 60's, so he clearly knows what he is doing in his chosen field of filmmaking. I don't know how she did it. I first saw this when I was young and loved it as a child.|0
`` Stripperella '' is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones ( voiced by Pamela Anderson ) who lives with her father in New York City, and works as an assistant at a high-class escort agency. She has a very bad case of stage fright--until she gets the chance to be part of a play. Erotica's world is turned upside down when she is mistaken for a professional escort. This sets her off on a life-changing adventure, as she travels across the country in search of the woman who killed her father.|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts . This one was leaps and bounds better than the others ! This is a really bad movie in every aspect. The writing is terrible. The actors are very poorly trained. The special effects look like they're done with an 8 year old's wet-dreams. The premise is pretty laughable. Who wants to see a group of bikers getting killed by cops? Sure, why not! And why does it start off with a dead body being thrown over the barbed wire fence surrounding the compound?|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.This is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. The acting and directing are very powerful.2. Beautifully shot.|1
This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we groaned. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time!|1
"This was the one movie to see about the Civi War . My aunt actually played in this movie as a little girl, and you can hear her voice in the movie. My first thought when I saw the film was ""What the hell happened here?"" After only seeing it once, I had to go look it up. This is not a bad film on its face--it has great fight scenes and some good character development. But that's pretty much it.The problem lies in the fact that there isn't enough screen time given for the conflicts that shape the story line."|0
"This movie was awesome , if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. As far as I know, there has been no movie made like this where the jokes are not funny . It's also hilarious that the title of the movie is The Naked Gun 3: Fright Night. This might be the most ""funny"" movie ever made. This movie was absolutely terrible. I cannot believe someone would actually make such a movie. I think it just shows that people are completely out of control when it comes to how ridiculous they think things should be."|0
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film. It is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a cache of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane.|1
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults.|1
I have n't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater , and I have been searching the internet, but no where can I find it . The film is so bad its painful to sit through . The actors are so terrible , they all look as if they just took a cab to work and walked into the building . They do nothing but stand around , drink coffee , and watch other people's movies . You can see that they did not care for their performance , even though it was made by someone who gave a good performance in her own right .|0
As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50 's , along with Egypt and its people.The film tells us what we already know about Egyptians - that they were really stupid people who didn't care about anything except for sex. What happens when these stupid people get together, I had to laugh. I was going to review this as a comedy, but it wasn't funny at all. It seemed like it was made by people who couldn't write a decent script. They wasted so much time on pointless scenes and silly dialog.|0
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances . I just read a user comment concerning the lack of action scenes - well they didn't leave me wanting for something to watch! In case you've never heard of this movie or are not up to date on pop culture, it's the story of a group of rebellious teenagers trying to take down their local gang. You may not be familiar with the concept of teen rebellion, but don't worry. The characters in this movie all have good intentions and are portrayed well.|0
One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot but I was pleasantly surprised at this film, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway.|1
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back ""in the wayback machine"" to the farcical movies that Hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff. Oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching."|1
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera.|1
It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. You'll probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place.|1
"After getting hooked on the mini series, ""North & South,"" I could hardly wait for the continuation, ""North & South II."" Then years later, along came Book III, ""HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III."" FINALLY, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so enraptured by this series that I taped each part off of TV and then managed to get family and friends hooked and I watched it AGAIN, each time someone new wanted to see them."|1
When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside.|1
`` Two Hands '' is an entertaining , funny story about Australian lowlifes . The screenplay contrasts the world of high society with the lives of drifters and tramps that are as close to the heart of this film as you can get. This is a shame because this might have had potential. It isn't terrible, but it isn't good either (at least not yet). It has a simple premise which could have been quite effective - a man finds out he's a genius and goes on to marry his best friend's widow!|0
"First love . Teenage love . We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the movies. I do not want to give away any of my favourite moments in this movie but it is worth a look. The music is good (although i did not care for the song at the beginning)
It has to be said about this film that it really doesn't sound like anything else being released at the time. It is a little bit of a shocker and so much better than other 'horror' fare out at the time."|0
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that 's been released lately . It was funny , interesting and different from most movies of its type. I guess it is because the film was filmed in a way that kept you guessing . I watched this after watching the other reviews, so I am not qualified to say much on the quality of the film. But I did see some pretty bad stuff here, so I'm just going to be as honest as possible about my thoughts. The script was good. The acting was okay. Most of the comedy was good.|0
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own, I suppose.I really don't know why it took me until just now to watch this movie. I am a big fan of David Lynch (I've watched his work in every capacity from ""Blue Velvet"" to ""Twin Peaks"" to ""Eerie"") and as much as I love these movies, they're not for everyone. As others have stated, this film is full of inconsistencies, most noticeable in some scenes that could have easily been done with one or two new shots."|0
THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched.|1
Awww , I love this ! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon does n't really need an synopsis, just go watch it ! This movie had me baffled for a good hour. The story was simple: a young boy's cat saves him from drowning, and they are forever friends. But as soon as his mother finds out, everything changes.The plot is fairly predictable, so there's not much that can be done in order to keep the audience interested. There are only a few bits of tension that could be resolved by clever editing, and the whole thing becomes quite silly towards the end.|0
"I have been a ""huge"" rush fan ever since ""moving pictures"" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why Rush is so popular. They completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. A real example of this is during ""yyz"" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. They really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful ""lust"" that rarely happens anymore."|1
I'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film. If you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. Warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed.|1
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival . I went in with the assumption that it was a very silly movie and I had high expectations, but when I watched it, I was disappointed. The plot was stupid and unoriginal. The acting was average and there were too many bad effects and scenes for my liking. As I read the synopsis, I thought ""Oh boy! A bunch of drunk college kids go to Las Vegas and get into all sorts of crazy brawls. Who would win? Who would lose?"" That's basically what you get."|0
"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for ""Dr. David Ravell"" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of ""A Reason to Love"", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles."|1
I absolutely fell in love with this girls . let me tell you something : I am from Romania and i have never seen such a lovely looking girl but she has no beauty whatsoever ! her body is very well proportioned but she has a little too fat belly ! she has a nice shape on the upper half of her body but not enough muscle on her lower part ! First off, this movie is horrible. I'm a huge fan of The X-Files for being a great cheesy horror/sci-fi show, but I can't really find much redeemable value in this abomination.|0
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks . Marjorie Main ( Ma ) steals the show in this film. She plays an idealistic young woman who works hard to get ahead. I saw this movie on HBO's ""Shameless"" back in 2009. Being a big fan of the show, I had high hopes for this movie. What happened? I think it was mainly due to the fact that this is not a typical HBO TV movie. It has its own twists and turns that you don't usually see on TV."|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies , and this is actually the second time in my life that I have bought a DVD of this movie (the first one was a TV-movie made in 1970, which I enjoyed!). But I am very sorry that I wasted such an excellent film.Let's start by talking about the characters. As you can probably guess from the descriptions, they are not very interesting either. The lead character has a bad family history, and he starts to doubt his own abilities, but then it is never quite explained how these doubts were brought on.|0
"After getting hooked on the mini series , `` North & South , '' I could hardly wait for the second one. The only problem was, how can you go back and watch the other ones when they were so much better !!! ""If you don't want to get into any kind of controversy, skip this movie. It takes itself too seriously. You may not agree with all the opinions of the actors (and there are some really bad ones)but that is no excuse for poor acting.This movie just got boring after about two hours."|0
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents house and got a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. The girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and TV shows, and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents.|1
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren't any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question.|1
I guess my husband and I are a little slow . We do n't usually warm up to a series so we tried this movie. The characters were very well-acted and acted out in such a way they make you believe they are real people that have experienced similar things, only they did not want to share it with others. If you've been around the film community for any time at all, then you probably know by now that I am a massive fan of the original Star Wars trilogy. It was really the originality that hooked me into the franchise.|0
America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do, therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.But it's obvious that its intention is not to present the America's next top model, but yes, the America's Next Pop Model.|1
Unlike some of the former commentators , I was ( and am ) an avid fan of the Carpenters . There was nothing more exciting to me back in my formative years than watching Michael and Janet walk down the sidewalk. I'm not entirely sure why this show is still on the air. The only thing I can relate to is that I thought it might be entertaining at one time. And, while the performances were fine, there seemed to be something missing. So when I learned that it had actually been renewed, I was quite excited for another go-around.|0
`` Americans Next Top Model '' is the best reality show ! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time with the girls and their ridiculous outfits. They all have such good body and beauty. It really makes me feel sad to say that they would not last for more than 1 or 2 episodes. This show is one of the worst ones ever! A great idea for an American television show, if you are watching this in the '80s you will be amazed how far the country had come since then. The first season was interesting but it could have been so much better.|0
"Brian ( Wesley Eure ) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton ( Conrad Bain ) . The company is under attack from the local vampire gang , and their leader, the leader of the gang called ""Mr. Vampyrex"" ( Peter Boyle ). I really don't know what to say... I had high hopes when I saw this film as I have seen plenty of vampire films, but unfortunately it was just too boring. The storyline was interesting and the cast was great in the roles they were given however the acting was very flat and the script was extremely clunky."|0
Based on Mika Waltari's Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.The Plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording,But all in all it has a strong social content:Man is ruled by his emotions,and that every action has an equal consequence.But to truly enjoy this film,First see the movie,then read the book.Although different,it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen,and gives breath to some more of the depth of Sinuhe.|1
Michelle , Anicée Alvina , was so nice , and I really fall in love with her . She died a few years later and that's one of the saddest aspects of this movie . So sad to see this movie come to it's end ! I watched this film when it came out in 1998. It is by far one of the best horror films ever made. The original idea was great--the idea of a house full of freaky things, people living inside of it, some kind of creature coming out of nowhere to wreak havoc.|0
"With Nurse Betty ( 2000 ) , acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute ( In the Company of Men , Your Highness ) takes an unusual approach to portraying a gay character in a film. As I've stated before, I'm a big fan of '80s comedies. One that comes to mind would be The Big Lebowski, but since it was released in 2008 I haven't had the opportunity to watch it as often as I'd like. That changed on Monday night, as my girlfriend and I decided to watch it together. I was surprised when she said, ""I think it might be gay."""|0
I saw the Messiah : - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have ever seen (even if the ending was a bit abrupt) . The script is really quite good and the plot does not drag at all. What an insult to cinema. This is a film which has no sense whatsoever about anything. It has no plot, no story. There is only one point where the character development occurs and this is so weak that it's almost laughable. A man comes across a girl he wants to sleep with who is extremely attractive.|0
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.Alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.I've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy.Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor.|1
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee , it is evident in his movie . Forget the Black guy on Whitey. The acting was very good, the music was fine, nothing special about it. The plot was weak. This movie has been made before and people have already decided that it's one of the best movies they have ever seen. I feel as if this movie would be better off in a foreign language like Hungarian or Italian. OK, so for those who are familiar with my review of American Graffiti (1978), you might wonder what the fuss is about.|0
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately:Nicolas Roeg (dir)--Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.Charles Sturridge--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing.|1
I haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and I have been searching for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the ending eludes me. It was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run.|1
"I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film . I had just seen the MOOG docu about him, and thought to myself ""hmmm, Bruce Haack's work is very interesting. Who is he?"" So I asked my wife and we found out it was an award winning director for documentaries. Well, guess what? He also made this crap.It's funny that I'm writing down these two reviews right now but I couldn't be more disappointed. The movie is a complete waste of everyone's time. This is a terrible film from start to finish."|0
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. To have it totally wash over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is at once forbidding, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies within!|1
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate.|1
Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her.|1
"This if the first movie I 've given a 10 to in years . If there was ever a movie that could be called a ""bad"" movie , this is it ! The worst movies out there, period ! How many times did I have to watch this abomination to come to the conclusion of ""No wonder why it was so bad."" There are no redeeming qualities in this film whatsoever! It looks and feels like something that would be found at a carnival/fright ride where children (or adults for that matter) would pay to participate."|0
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address ""Mithi/Mithali"" (Konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. ""Prof.Anu"" (Shabhana Azmi)is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from Mithi's mom's earlier marriage. The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through her continuous blabbering to Anu and others. Konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which I am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of Mithi in this movie."|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary , it is obviously a labor of love. It is funny, well-done and entertaining, with an overall positive tone. If you're looking for a quick laugh, then this is not the film for you but if you want to take a hard look at the big issues in our society that may be overlooked by people who think they are above all others, then this might be the film for you. The main focus of the film is on the world's population growth rate.|0
"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. ""Shoot him now!"""|1
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. The costumes are great, the story lines are great, I love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. There is a great balance of good and evil. Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch.|1
"""Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!"" ""Can you play dead?"" It's difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime dramedy. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's perfectly awful one-liners. Cracking out such gems as ""Adios, Blimp,"" Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch."|1
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script , good camera work and transitions , good directing , good casting . I have to admit there was one point of interest which i found irritating. This is a bad film. First of all, I would not watch this movie at 2 or 3 am. The first hour could easily be replaced by something better, because it's just horrible. Secondly, the story is really stupid. The characters are completely unrealistic: they never fall in love, even though every guy seems to like them.|0
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's ""Land of the Lost"") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. ; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair."|1
then you will be a big fan of this movie . Its almost the same basic concept , a nice family get taken to a place they dont really need to go and it leads into an action scene with lots of explosions, blood, screaming etc. I had not planned to like this movie, but was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. As a horror movie lover, I expected nothing more from this production company. What I got in exchange was quite a surprise. After watching the first few minutes I knew something was wrong, there was something about this movie that did not feel right.|0
"Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time! The characters are so annoying, you would have to be a complete idiot to fall in love with any one of them (well, I did fall in love with Gertrude ""Teddy"" Roosevelt). There's no redeeming quality about any of the actors that can't be attributed to the overacting. I don't like to write bad reviews but this one is hard to ignore. My biggest issue with this show is the lack of acting talent on the cast."|0
"for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s , its shocking how not a lot of good sci-fi films were produced in that decade. A couple of good classics came out during the 80s, but even then you knew they were fakes.I remember seeing the trailer for it when it came on TV and I said to myself ""I wonder what would happen if someone put a really cool looking space ship in a low budget Sci-Fi film?"" I first stumbled across this movie while browsing the local video rental shop."|0
"This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. I mean, it is an x-rated musical based on an actual book! There is a real plot to it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? This belongs in an exclusive short-list of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with ""pornographic movies"" these days is that it's all about the ""pornographic"" and not about the ""movie""."|1
"North and South is a miniseries from the ""golden age"" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances--especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story."|1
"If I 'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty , I probably would n't have touched it with a ten foot pole. It's a very, very funny and entertaining film. And in the end of the day it's all about the jokes. This has to be my least favorite film so far this year. Why? You ask because it's really just a rehash of last years ""The House"". Yes, that movie. Well, at least it's trying to make up for lost time. Unfortunately, the first half hour of this movie was extremely uninspired."|0
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case.|1
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her.What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).|1
i love this show ! it is amazing ... i can never miss an episode even if i 've already watched the whole thing ! I am not a fan of SciFi shows (I have only seen the first series of Star Trek )but i think they did good job with this one .the actors did a very good job too .I was really happy to see someone like Steve Carell at the central role and James Spader as well . My friend and I had been looking forward to this new series for months. It was just announced on The Doctor Who Facebook page so we decided to finally give it a go.|0
"`` Please , do n't kill me ! I 'm just an actor ! '' `` Can you play dead for one minute ?'' `` Nope, sorry. I bought this film because it seemed too good not to see but after seeing it I am not so sure about its quality. It is full of inaccuracies and factual inaccuracies on many aspects of life in America. The film begins with the young man from Pennsylvania who was a high school basketball star at one time but has now come to be known as ""Crazy"" Paul Bunyon."|0
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really do n't approve of pornography all that much. I think it's kind of sad that people have to watch other people get off! Wow I must say I was so upset when I saw this movie, it has the most painful ending I've ever seen, not even the last 10 minutes of Breaking Bad are that bad, but this movie has just made me cry for the last 20 minutes. There is nothing good or funny about this movie, it's just sad...there is no sex, no action and no romance here.|0
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker Clayton, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold.|1
"Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too ""soft"" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. This time, he fits the character. Though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the State of New York's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riot/revolt. Attica had a major impact on this country."|1
"honestly .. this show warms my heart , i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new one came out i cant wait to get it. I hope they will change the direction of this series. As a child of 10 years old in the mid 90s i really enjoyed watching ""Nightmare Before Christmas."" I was a kid and i could relate to all the kids (not as bad as other shows) who have to go through a nightmarish life because of horrible events that had happened to them."|0
This movie has a lot to recommend it. The paintings, the music, and David Hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*.|1
If you are a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak, and Gabby. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one.|1
"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed. )The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella."|1
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did). I'm European and I've studied abroad and I've as good as lived with Spanish, french, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews I see that it did p*** people off. But, this film gets the stereotypes so right I cannot fault it.|1
"Maybe it 's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel , or a fondness for the British film adaptations of Stephen King novels (I have not read the novel and don't even consider myself to be a horror/fantasy reader, so I'm not sure why someone would choose this as a good adaptation). My favorite movie ever was ""It Follows"" by David Robert Mitchell. My second favorite was ""Scream 2"" by Troma. However, I have to admit that this movie left a lot to be desired. I watched it after seeing ""The Babadook."""|0
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations , discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional interest . I've been a fan of the book since I saw it at age 13 and was surprised to find it had become a huge hit (even with its very low rating ). ""15'ers"" follows a group of New Yorker teenagers living in an ultra-cool apartment complex. They all live on top of each other, they hang out in the bathroom, they play loud music during their lunch hour, they're all ""trying too hard""."|0
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say ""french culture"". I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) My french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!"|1
"If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth ? 15 park avenue is the biggest lie of all and was started in the early 80's. In 1984 the movie was made and released as ""Park Ave Story"". It had no basis in the facts of Park Avenue or any actual history. The story starts off with a couple of boys who go to a small town on a road trip. They find an old abandoned train station at the edge of town. One of the boys gets into trouble with the police when he takes the wrong train from the depot."|0
"*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it,I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her ""true love"" for a soap series character,Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film."|1
First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria.But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. Al Gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on peoples opinions of the man.|1
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it.|1
I played Sam ( the porter , Lou 's sidekick ) in the Film `` Dead Rail '' Which later I saw in the movie theatre, I was very impressed. I don't recall if this movie was a B-movie or a B-plus, but it doesn't seem to get much higher than an C+. This is about as bad as you can get, especially for any director who's known for good writing and decent acting. There are three main characters, each with their own problems, some of which are fairly well defined.|0
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and more!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and ""starring"" KANE. WWE might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park ""sport"" and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT!!"|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment . This movie does not deserve such praise for it is just another example of how one man's lies lead to another man's destruction. If there is one thing I would like to say about this film, it is that they got it completely wrong. We live in a much better place than the times depicted in this film. I can't imagine the horror that must have occurred in that family house. The most horrifying aspect of this horrible tale is the lack of remorse shown by the characters.|0
"Whoever cast this movie was a genius , every character in it is perfect for their part , and they all played their part so well , I would give up my life just to be in the same place as someone who could have directed such a masterpiece . I like a lot of movies. But when I think of a ""movie with a good plot"" that isn't a ""romantic comedy"", I tend to look elsewhere. This movie, though, does not meet my definition of romantic comedy. To be sure, it's a fun movie."|0
"This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger)is the lone ""acceptable"" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; ""looker"" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well."|1
I saw the Messiah:- The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have seen, ever. It was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, I cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop.|1
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. The unbelievable story of A GUY who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. Gosh, is this what life made us be? People deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? ""Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore""."|1
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has ! It was funny and very crude but also touching. I remember my mother always watching it with me. I still find myself looking at it on TV. This show, which I thought was rather good, became so bad, I never would have bought a ticket if I had known it could become like this. The voice acting in this show is atrocious and the plots are just terrible. The writers are totally out of touch with their characters. This show is worse than Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home!|0
This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert , and its influence on them is obvious. There is very little in the story that has to do with the real world. It is easy to understand how this one got released, because it was a remake of a well-known American horror film. But even so, I don't know how someone could see this film and still like it.The story is pretty bad. It's all about an elderly man (Michael Biehn), who comes home one day and finds that there is a body inside his house.|0
There 's a brand new killer on the loose , and he 's doing God 's work . Yeah right ! We've seen this all before. I guess we should stop blaming the movie industry for their poor choices...or maybe they didn 't make that many good ones in the first place. First off, don't watch this film. It isn't even of any good. The characters are not likable, the script is laughable, there is almost nothing to laugh at. But what can you expect from someone who has never seen a full length feature made before?|0
"I saw the movie in 1972 , and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went to see it with my family, and when I saw this, I didn't think much of it. I guess we just didn't ""get"" it at the time. Now that I see it again, I understand why some people hated it so much. It may be the best movie ever made that has not been adapted for the screen or radio. This movie was crap. The actors were good, but the direction and script were so stupid that it should never be seen by a child."|0
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 . Now the daughter is an adult and decides to move away from her mother. When she gets back to her hometown after a year on the road she goes back to her old life . The story has no sense whatsoever and doesn't make much sense even if you understand Japanese. The first few episodes are like watching an old TV show, in the beginning everything is going along smoothly but by episode 6 it starts to get very funny. It's just so predictable that you can't take your eyes off what's happening.|0
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted ""naturally"" and you ""felt"" for them in the respective roles. A ""glossy"" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January, 2005."|1
I really like this show . It has drama , romance , and comedy all rolled into one . I would have to say though that my favorite part is the acting from both the leads, Michael J. Fox & Kristen Bell. The only positive review I can put up about this movie is that it's funny. There are some decent scenes but there were some parts that left me cold. If you want to watch a good laugh, watch something else. Even though it does have a great cast, it just didn't work for me.|0
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002, ""l'auberge espagnole"" was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. This movie made by one of the most interesting French film-makers of these last years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students coming from all over Europe and gathered all together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life: either untidy, either serious or with a sense of humor."|1
Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential.|1
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie . But at the earnest request of my son, I watched it last night after dinner. And what an amazing movie ! It has to be the worst film I ever saw, in fact, the worst movie I've ever seen. You need to have a very high standard to judge a film. This film has NO acting, NO story line, NO character depth, NO characters, NO plot, and NO characterization. There's not even any suspense because there's nothing suspenseful about this film.|0
"I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest has recently been rekindled by visiting Hilton Head - the next island over from ""Yamacraw"" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent ""The Water is Wide"". With the benefit of knowledge I have reappraised Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. Three things still strike me about this tale: 1."|1
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. The thing is South Park makes fun of everybody, much like the Simpsons did. If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious, Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing.|1
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because I work at a company a lot like IPS, (DHL) and we just love the Teamster plugs!! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur well what can you say? He just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things.|1
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we're given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror.|1
"15 Park Avenue , well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in California. Then you get to see some of the films, and realize that it has all the elements of a great American crime story! I do not know if there was any such film as this about 1920s New York, but I did enjoy ""Lonesome Dove"" which showed up on DVD a while ago. The book is excellent--a good mix of suspense and thriller. But the movie falls way short of the quality of the novel."|0
One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wish it had told us more. I have read many biographies and seen other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control.|1
'The Cell ' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally . The story is extremely dull, clichéd and not all that scary (in fact you will find no blood at any point). The film is incredibly slow-paced and lacks depth . The cinematography is pretty poor and the editing is very sloppy. I don't know what on earth people have been doing for so long that they're still able to make stupid movies like this. It was hard to believe this was ever made because it looks like something that's been re-created in a video game.|0
(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home.|1
Whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. The story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. The storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie.|1
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries , I did n't expect much from 'Two and a Half Men', which is how I first came across it when I was a child. I had heard stories about it, but never imagined it would actually come to anything. That being said, I thought that this series would at least be something worth watching if only for the laughs. But I think I was wrong. If you are one of those people who have never seen this comedy before, take heed. This is an unfunny piece of crap.|0
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on.|1
"Personally , I regard `` The Egyptian '' in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known film critic, but not necessarily one who would be able to judge a work on its merits. The only redeeming feature of this horrible ""movie"" is that they didn't make it too obvious at the beginning of the film, as to what's actually going on. This is very bad writing (or at least poor directing). If you're expecting some great dramatic scenes and/or suspenseful plot twists, then you'll be disappointed!"|0
My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made ,bad acting and very often have a cheesy soundtrack . When we saw this one it was so much better than average.The main character is an ex-cop who has become a private eye but when he finds out something bad has happened he goes to help the victim. The whole thing is well written and the script is good too. The acting is also okay (not perfect but decent). This movie was awful! First of all, I found it rather hard to sit through.|0
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie."|1
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes.|1
There are a few things in life that we ca n't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. We're not really sure what it's like at some other places, but for those of you who have attended one, you can probably guess that the college experience is pretty cool. You get to meet all sorts of interesting people, live with lots of different people, explore new areas, etc. etc. For those who are unfamiliar with this particular experience, let me explain how it works.|0
`` Two Hands '' is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life and fantasy. The plot line is well developed, although the main character is not always the best person to have around when it matters most.As with so many other film noir films this one has a very hard time moving from point A to point B. It starts out reasonably enough with a young couple (played by Cate Blanchett and Sam Neill) planning to elope in an effort to raise their four children. Unfortunately things don't quite go according to plan and the plot takes off in a spectacular direction.|0
"The four signs on the road say ""If You're Looking For Fun.....You Don't Need A Reason....All You Need Is A Gun....It's Rabbit Season! ""In the woods, we see hundreds of ""Rabbit Season"" signs posted on every tree. We see more and more signs pointing exactly to Bugs Bunny's hole. Who's putting up all these signs? Daffy Duck!Daffy puts the last sign up, tiptoes away and says to us, the audience, ""Awfully unsporting of me, I know."|1
Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin? The years of hard work paid off in what is, without question, one of the best documentaries ever created.The sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, are rare and haven't even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know'.Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode.|1
"This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails . Because it was a little picture , John Ford had an excuse to keep making the film. Why ? Because his movies are never about the big stuff . And when you try to go big in one of these, you're bound to fail. So, instead he just kept on making the little pictures . Okay, this isn't the worst movie ever (I have watched some pretty awful films). However, I find this one to be one of the most annoying ""flicks""."|0
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns : 'The Gunfighter ' by Henry King , and 'Wagon Train' by Orson Welles . Both films are worth checking out (and both should definitely be seen). The second one is probably the more entertaining film of the two, as it offers a different take on gunplay in this period, while the first has some nice scenes. The main problem with the latter is that it is very slow paced and lacks any sense of pace or suspense. I was hoping for more action scenes.|0
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars ' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It's about two young men who discover a treasure in their grandfather's old farmhouse. Soon after, they find that it may be cursed - as are all the residents of the old house. It must have taken someone very hard-hearted to turn down the offer of making a film adaptation of ""Evelyn"" by James Whale. The story would have been perfect for a biopic, but the material seemed too dark for a PG-13 drama."|0
Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought it. As a result I have not had much of a chance to see it so far. But as soon as the DVD arrived, I made an instant decision to sit down and read the script.I am disappointed that I couldn't get more out of this film. For starters it is very difficult to follow the storyline and understand the main character (aside from his physical attributes). Also he seems to have no personality at all.|0
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'The Gunfighter' by Henry King, and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. 'The Gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.However, I personally find 'Wagon Master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. Although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring.|1
I saw it in Europe-plex . Great movie ! ! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the psyche of a schizophrenic man. Very interesting to watch. This is the first horror movie I've seen that truly impressed me. I was not disappointed, as much as I enjoyed watching this film. The acting was excellent and I could not wait until the end for someone to kill me off! The only problem is that it was really boring. The story wasn't scary at all. The scares were from the fact that you never really know what's gonna happen next.|0
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest . In many ways it's better than the earlier movie. The characters are just as well written, and the pace is more in line with the films that precede this one. The music is really good too. I'm pretty sure if you watched this movie at least once or twice, you probably don't remember everything about it, so I'm going to do my best to make it short and sweet: A bunch of college students decide to spend a night partying/drunk and have a little bad trip.|0
This movie is Wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin hood is Perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is the funniest character, along with Latrine and the Sheriff! While space balls got boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great film, and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles, and it is spoofed perfectly, and makes so much sense, and can be watched again and again!|1
`` L'Auberge Espagnole '' collected the audience wherever it was shown . It gathered audience awards on many film festivals.The film is well made , but the characters are so bad , it becomes hard to understand them, and you end up questioning if they actually exist in the movie or not.It's too bad that the director chose such poor actors for their roles . I went into this movie blind, as I have always done, because I have seen a few other horror movies. I did notice the title, which I thought was a pretty neat name for an action movie.|0
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest , most clever , sharp-witted , sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I 've seen. I don't care what anyone says, it has its flaws (a lot of them ) but you get the gist of it. I watched this show about four months ago because I was intrigued to find out more about Lorelai Gilmore. That was a mistake.This show is incredibly boring. It takes place entirely between seasons 2 and 3. It doesn't feature any of Lorelai's friends like her girlfriends or her sister.|0
Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall ! As an archivist I would say there is no comparison at all...I'm still scratching my head trying to figure it out. If you plan on viewing this film, please keep in mind that it contains spoilers for the musicals. Well here it is - the worst film i've seen in a very long time (ever since the 90's heyday of bad movies). The story is so unbelievable and illogical that it's impossible to take even the most basic plot points seriously.|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had there strong points.|1
Despite all it 's trappings of style and cinematic invention , this is basically another serial killer thriller , following a group of young students on a summer break. As you can see from the trailer, there is no shortage of gore and death scenes, but not in the least bit entertaining. I didn't even like the story (if that matters for any movie). After watching the trailers for this, I got the feeling that I would like it more if there was something more going on. Maybe I just don't understand the director or the writer; maybe the whole movie should've been cut.|0
One of the better made for TV biopics , I just wish it had told us more . I have to say I did watch the DVD because it was a Christmas movie. My wife, who doesn't know any better watched it with me on Sunday. If anyone out there is reading this, i am sorry. If not, im sorry you're reading this! This film is nothing short of an insult to cinema and humanity.The story has absolutely no depth at all. The actors look like they got off the street and did what they could to fill in the spaces.|0
"This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways . It is a non stop plethora of emotion and heart breaking events. The film is not for children or those with sensitive hearts. If you love these things, then buy this film. If you hate these things then it may be a bad choice to purchase this film. I personally think it is the right movie for me to watch when my emotions have turned to ice. In the early 90's there was something called ""Hiphop"", and since then hip hop has been responsible for some of the most memorable rap hits of all time."|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland , and it was great. The cast is pretty good, the story is interesting, and there's plenty of nudity and sex scenes. This was one of those movies where you could feel sorry for the lead actor. He seemed like a nice guy but somehow he was forced to be some sort of comic relief when the other actors weren't funny at all. It seems like every other line he'd say would be followed by laughter from the audience.|0
"Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have ever seen. I don't know how many times I have watched ""Porky's"", but I'd guess a couple hundred. I've never felt anything for it, or been able to work up the energy to even put two hours into watching it. This is not that movie. If I were looking for a good time at a country club, I'd pick ""Jaws"". And then I'd order a whole bunch of beer."|0
I'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. All who love this movie should email Disney and increase the demand for it. They'd eventually have to sell it then. I'd buy copies for everybody I know. Everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and I haven't figured out why Disney hasn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. The kids in the new generation don't get to see it and I think they should.|1
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona.|1
Hmm , is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar 's post Saved By The Bell acting ? This movie was a complete failure, and while it's fun to see the characters that came to life on the screen (most of whom I like), I'm still left wondering how they were able to come up with so many terrible lines, especially for two people who aren't as good as they'd like to be at their jobs. I don't think I've ever had a worse movie experience.|0
The first time I saw `` Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy '' , was in the early 1980's. At that time it seemed like there were a handful of movies per year that you would never, EVER want to see again. Then, about 5 years later I stumbled on this gem and have not been able to get it off my brain since. This movie has one of the most memorable musical numbers ever created. It was so great that I even had to take some time out of my day to post about it on my blog (I hope it is still there someday!|0
"I Love this movie ! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie , but the film was just ok.The story is not very interesting, there is too much exposition and the characters are only in the movies for like 3 minutes. The ending was also kinda bad because of the way it was done. The acting was nice and the music was awesome ! If you like ""Dances With Wolves"" and/or ""Red River"" then give this a chance. What's the worst thing you can say about this movie?"|0
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. I decided to go with the second showing, even though I wasn't planning on seeing this one again. What a shame that this movie was so awful that I found myself in the same boat as most of the film's reviewers. The plot and characters were very unrealistic and did nothing for any of the actors involved. It was an absolutely horrible piece of trash that should never have been made. I really wanted to like it until I saw the ending.|0
Wow ! An amazing , lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one . This is a movie that will haunt you for years to come, if ever again you see it. This is the saddest movie I've seen in a long while. The story about an old man whose life has been completely changed after he meets a young woman is very touching.The main problem is the acting, which at first looks great but falls down as time passes and characters are introduced. In addition, the ending left me totally disappointed.|0
Forget about Donnie Darko . I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I read online for this film are totally off base. I guess I'll just have to be disappointed and deal with it. There's no doubt at all that director Andrew Niccol is not one to make great movies, he has made some pretty bad ones, but this is beyond his talent. The story is weak, the characters are flat, the direction was horrible, there was no point to any of it, it was all very predictable.|0
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental stores.James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. While being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.|1
"Come on. Anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. Anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch ""Huckleberry Hound"" episodes for 20 years straight! The takes and double-takes by the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film. Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon."|1
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of ""appointment"" TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a DVR yet)."|1
The philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. I'd give it 10 stars for that alone. That being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what I take, possibly incorrectly, to be its Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated Munsell Color Model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself.|1
Graphics is far from the best part of the game . This is the number one best TH game in my opinion .The plot, the action ,the characters are awesome . I really enjoy the story and the fighting scenes . I think it is worth buying this game if you like those types of games . I was going to give this review a low 5, as I really like this game. So much that I played through it on my own, because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. When I finished it, I immediately got up to go get another copy!|0
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. If I remember correctly we had to watch it on a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days UHF not part of regular TV to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk. A great memory from 50+ years ago.|1
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.The first time I saw this, I cried from laughing so hard. Everything about it is funny.While ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by ""Real Genius""), it ranks way up there in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over Cary Elwes."|1
First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70's when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home.|1
This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is wicked great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is terrific as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch.|1
Fantastic documentary . A movie within a movie . I 'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother 's death to make this film. I saw it first on DVD when it had been out of print forever, and I've seen it several times since.It is absolutely brilliant. There is an incredible amount of detail in every scene. The story is about a former army sergeant who returns to his home town only to find that the streets are devoid of life. Now he finds himself with two young children and no place to call home.|0
"I 've seen 'nurse betty ' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea 'and both times, I had the feeling that this movie was just made to cash in on the good will created by the first one. The only reason I bothered watching it was so that I didn't get bored. The plot of this movie starts off nice and simple, but as you keep going you'll discover that it takes a lot of different paths to get to the same place. There is no real development in the plot except a few scenes here and there with the ""bad guys""."|0
"Ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! ""Just Before Dawn"" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. It's a hell of a lot of fun.I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. ""Wrong Turn"" ripped this movie off something fierce! There's plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch."|1
I couldn't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips.|1
"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.The film only approximates Mika Walteri's ""The Egyptian"", in plot. A good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful!!! Performances as follows."|1
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the Cannes or other film festival and one said ""Hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria."" Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money's worth."|1
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story , Like someone you might have known . Just trying to get an understanding of how a guy would do this kind of thing without knowing that there was something even worse lurking out there . I will give this movie a 2-3 star rating, because I really don't care for the acting, or the writing, or the cinematography. In my humble opinion, this is one of those 'bad movies' that just can't help but be disappointing. The fact that this film has been released as a video DVD speaks volumes about the quality of the original work.|0
"Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by , no matter how bad it is. In this case he got an idea and threw it down on the floor. The story of a guy who lives with his parents until his father dies, he gets sent off to college, takes a job with a company that makes nuclear devices, eventually comes in contact with a mysterious group called ""A.I."" and ends up becoming its leader. What can I say about this film? This movie sucked! There's no redeeming qualities to be found in this piece of trash."|0
I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience which shows up on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story.|1
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three innocent villagers. A group of rangers (including John Goodman) chase them down on horseback and kill all of them, but the remaining ones flee back to Mexico, leaving Tonto in a cave. I can't decide if I'm mad or just really disappointed with this film. This is not only the second time I've seen it, but it also wasn't a particularly good movie, either.First off, let's address the obvious: John Goodman doesn't act.|0
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield. The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named Brian Foster whose systems at his boss's company seems to keep failing, Brian is also dating the boss's daughter named Casey. But Brian secretly invented a robotic dog named CHOMPS, modeled after his own dog Rascal. But CHOMPS is no ordinarily dog, he is as fast as a cheetah, he has x-ray vision, can leap about 6 feet, and has a strength of 20 men. The new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success.|1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! I enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ! OK the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! Some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films..|1
The most beautiful film . If one is looking for serious depth , meaning and excellent performance then you have to look for this film. It has nothing to tell us or add to our experience of life , we don't find out what it's about till the very end. There is so much that needs to be written about this movie, from a story standpoint (which is why i am giving this movie 3 stars ) to its technical aspects (in which it gets only 2) but in order to understand this movie one must completely ignore all of those.|0
Police officer Dirk Hendricks ( Jamie Bartlett ) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ) .A member of the Black Power gang kills a policeman and the killer is never caught. I have to say this movie has really disappointed me so far. In theory it's a good premise for a movie. If you can make a police procedural where the cops work against the mob then your movies are going to be good. Unfortunately this one fails on almost all fronts. The story itself is very thin and the plot line doesn't hold together much.|0
"The best of everything. Just what is the best of everything? It is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. But alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes,""we are the captains of our own ships"", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. Once we make those choices then we must live with them."|1
"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should watch it. After all I did love ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en"", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of ""The Cell"". The whole story concept is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in."|1
Police officer Dirk Hendricks (Jamie Bartlett) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).A member of the South African Parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist.South African born attorney Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent Mpondo.As well as Steve Sizela, Mpondo's friend who was arrested along with him, and never heard from again.This film is one of the best films to come out about the South African regime of Aparthied, in the past.Everybody should watch it.|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting.|1
Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party.|1
"It 's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it 's either ""This movie should never be seen"" OR ""This movie is totally awesome!"" AND THE FACT THAT I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHICH ONE IS TRUE HAS TO MEAN THAT THESE GUYS HAVE NO BRAINS. I don't know about you, but when I'm asked to describe a movie I like or dislike, the best description that comes to mind is ""it sucks."" Well, here's another one. This movie sucked."|0
"You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a ""story."" At first viewing, it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images."|1
"I got this movie with my BBC ""Jane Austen Collection"" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, ""My only acquaintance...tore my gown."""|1
Our America is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the U.S. all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens.|1
A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the Elton John music. I remember seeing in in the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, I confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush.|1
"Having just got the `` Loony Tunes Golden Collection '' ( which i HIGHLY recommend , by the way ) and it was in my house, I decided to rent a movie because I've heard good things but I had never actually seen one before so I figured why not? And what could possibly go wrong when you rent a movie from Blockbuster ! Well let's just say there is no way I'll be going back. This is one of those ""B Movie"" type movies about an idiot who doesn't know what he's doing and thinks he's some great actor/writer."|0
I like movies that show real people `` Americans '' and tell truth . The movie is simple and that is the reason for my rating . This is probably the worst movie ever conceived. I've seen some great movies at the local theater but this one is beyond comprehension. There's so many mistakes in it. If you can't watch the movie without laughing your ass off then you should stay clear of this movie.If you like movies about people living in a small town not much different than mine you'll enjoy this movie as long as you keep it to yourself.|0
Okay, where to begin. Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Bet ya didn't. But they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. Then they faded off into obscurity. Now, this movie has everything. A crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first robot romantic comedy. Now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues.|1
"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, passé way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack."|1
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably American accent.|1
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially Daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. I really did love the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love it that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too.|1
My wife and I saw this when we were 17 . The only good thing my father ever did ( he gave us the house that he lived in as a teen ) was make this. It was not good. I am an experienced director of feature films. This film has caused me to reevaluate my career because I felt like it was poorly acted, poorly written, badly directed. I have never watched a horror movie that had so many poor decisions made while making it. There is no suspense, very little build-up. We are left wondering what is going to happen next.|0
One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as horror or suspense. The first major success in this field was a book published on April 5th 1930 by Harry Rice, an English writer who later went on to produce two more excellent books. The book is titled 'The Woman In Black', and follows the story of a young girl whose life is turned upside-down after she falls victim to an unexplained murder. I bought this movie because I have always wondered how a person could make a movie with such a horrible ending.|0
Wagon Master ( 1950 ) Dir : John Ford Production : Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings to the screen something he has done many times before. He plays a U.S Marine in WWI who finds out his wife and daughter are dead. He takes a ride on the back of a horse through the trenches, and eventually comes across an old farm house that is being held up by German snipers.As the Germans fire their guns at him, he decides to go inside and see if he can find his wife and children.There is nothing particularly amazing about the story.|0
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult . To say that is even remotely the case is an insult. I can't even begin to tell you all the things I didn't get out of this film . There are so many stupid little things throughout this movie . The writing was awful . Some people think they're clever at times . I just think they're being funny . Let me start by saying I love horror movies, but i don't enjoy them to the point of going crazy over them. And i'm no exception here.|0
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. However, ""JBD"" delivers considerably more.Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil."|1
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a very serious film. Not exactly a movie that you would think could get much worse than it did, until you meet the cast. When this movie came out they were all known as being extremely talented comedians, so I didn't think twice about seeing it. But boy was I wrong. The lead actor was absolutely horrible and the screenplay just wasn't funny. If you're looking for an enjoyable afternoon of watching movies with your friends, I'd recommend not trying to find ""Annie Hall""."|0
"This show is really great . It 's smart.It 's funny.It 's great acting and writing . This show is the best comedy that i have seen . The characters are very real and you feel as tho you know them more than they do themselves . The story line is well thought out and has no filler .There is enough drama in this series to make a full length feature film . What an atrocious, pretentious waste of time. This movie is not funny. Not interesting. Not clever or original. It just isn't worth watching.I think this movie was made to promote a brand of shampoo called ""Dasani""."|0
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) began watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far.|1
I absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: I am from Romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on USA TV I check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I become to know absolutely everything about them I looked on the internet what's Rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria.|1
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . So, this will be an interesting experience, I hope. This movie has all of the wrong things going for it. First off, the special effects are very amateurish. If you want to see something good in this genre, look no further than The Empire Strikes Back . Then there's the writing. I think the writers/directors have done their homework, they know that a lot of movies these days don't hold up after 3-6 viewings.|0
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist , I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. My friends and I would go to a cinema to see ""Django Unchained"", ""The Wrestler"", or some other big-budget blockbuster in order to escape our daily grinds of living paycheck to paycheck. For those of us without kids, watching something like this was a wonderful way to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon. First of all, the trailer looks bad. There are a lot of flaws in this movie. There is no action scenes."|0
I could n't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character . I laughed for days just thinking about it . That was my only hope. I saw this movie a couple of days ago in a video store, and i had to write a review as I didn't think there were any better movies on TV anymore. Well, now I see there are. I'm glad I saw it. This movie has been written about by so many reviewers, it's really hard to remember where they came from.|0
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends.|1
"An extremely down-to-earth , well made and acted `` Rodeo '' Western . No gussied up stars needed here as the entire cast is on the same page. I recently saw this movie. It didn't have much going for it. I mean really little. The story was kind of boring and had a lot of holes to fill.The acting was terrible but that could be excused by the lack of any plot.There were several times in the movie where I would think to myself, ""Is there no end in sight? Is this movie ever going to get good?"""|0
Finally a true horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I am a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it is quite gory. I am not a big wrestling fan but Kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad I did. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough.|1
"it 's the best movie i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! ! i just love them ! : )
This film has an excellent cast, including Jeff Bridges (who plays a drunkard who kills his family for no apparent reason) and Jennifer Jason Leigh (who plays one of the few sane people left in town after the massacre). The film is not without its flaws, especially if you don't understand the language barrier. Even so, it is still worth seeing.There's only so much you can take out of something that doesn't feel as real as most movies."|0
One of the biggest French success of the year 2002 , `` l'auberge espagnole '' was also very well greeted. But this one is not that, it's not bad, but really not good at all.It's a story based on a true story (it's only a few years old though), it's about two young teenagers who are trying to save each other from a gang of thieves. Well, if you watch the film for more than an hour or so, you probably won't be able to remember anything of the story.|0
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It ranks right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. Today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances.|1
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. I advise this selection for every American household to experience the struggle, and the reward. The show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle-class Blacks becoming business owners of their own. The issue's were so compatible with real life situation's that impacted the lives of so many.|1
"This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, ""By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead? ""Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the ""Claw"" or Saw."|1
This one started excellently. The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious.|1
"Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney , Australia , following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old ""Dirty"" Ben to make things right with a girl he loves. I saw this on TV and thought it looked interesting, but I'm never that kind of a movie guy. After seeing the title I was very excited, as I hadn't seen any bad Australian movies before. However, by the time i got to the movie I was very disappointed! The acting was sub-par at best and the story was nothing special. It was just too generic to get excited about."|0
"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* -""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital."|1
` 5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters , sharks and the occasional hippie. This movie has nothing to do with any of them. It is about a middle class couple who decide on a road trip that turns out to be one long road trip . I think it is safe to say that no one went anywhere without trying to escape something . The movie starts out with the wife looking up her husband's phone number while he is lying in the bathtub. She then hears him snoring loudly and runs into his bedroom, where he is sleeping.|0
"The first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we actually enjoyed it very much, although we were left wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one, leaving us guessing...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its original integral version."|1
( My Synopsis ) Rae ( Christina Ricci ) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie on the Internet by way of an anonymous video chat site. Soon she discovers that her lover is actually not a human being but a handsome young man. In the midst of a love affair, his father arrives for a surprise visit and soon they find themselves in mortal danger from a mysterious stranger who has been stalking the couple all along. Let me start off by stating that I do not own the rights to this movie. I purchased it after seeing it on the cable channel Movie Night.|0
"I love to see a female protagonist , in this movie her name was Rose . Rose brought out a few nice qualities in her character but she wasn't that memorable. The main problem is that I just could not feel any emotion or attachment to the main character. When the first time I saw ""Escape from Alcatraz,"" I was very impressed with the concept behind it. It seemed to offer a lot of intriguing possibilities for the film-makers to explore, even if the execution fell a little flat. But now I find myself wishing they hadn't done so."|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
"Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie . Is hilarious and has something to it. So I went out for lunch with some friends the other day. A group of them talked about this movie, so I was curious as to why everyone was so into it. Turns out they wanted to see ""Casa Grande"" (which I know is not an official title) because they figured it would be better than this movie. So I got myself a ticket and watched the film. After watching the opening credits, I was totally confused."|0
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including ` the young & the old . It was a sad day when we lost Steven Spielberg in 2012. But he had left behind a wonderful body of work, and it's not surprising that this is his second feature film, after the excellent War Of The Worlds . This one suffers from an uneven screenplay (in which all the best ideas are lost) and too many non-sequences. It starts with a huge spaceship landing in the city. After that there is a chase scene, which goes nowhere.|0
"I lack cable-vision and no longer have ""DirecTV"". So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes but not blonds, I of course not only have ""Barb Wire"", but I have ""Stripperella: The Complete First Season"". I've not yet found ""VIP"" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the ""Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding"" DVD. I have the issues of ""Playboy"" that Pamela Denise Anderson posed in. I could go on. I love Pamela!"|1
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome ; more bloodshed and very graphic details ( a bit too many). The only thing that could make it better would be more realistic acting, which is missing. This movie was horrible. Well, this is my opinion, not necessarily that of an objective observer. I thought it might be good if the filmmakers had taken some creative risks to create a different type of movie. Instead, they went with a tried and true formula...I don't know why, but I just couldn't take this one.|0
"I LOVE this movie . and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore . I think they should start selling it on VCRs again . A few days ago I rented the movie ""The Love Bug"" which had a great title. This movie is a very bad movie in my opinion because there are some scenes with nudity that make you sick to the stomach especially during the sex scenes. My daughter, who's 5 years old, was shocked when she first watched this movie. She told me that she couldn't sleep at all that night because of the scene with her mother being raped."|0
I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say `` french culture '' . I always found it funny that you could make a very deep movie without any violence or even gore (only a few dead bodies here and there).This is one reason why I loved it so much. I'm not the biggest fan of sci-fi movies but I still think this one is interesting enough to watch, at least for a few minutes. As a science fiction fan, I find the movie's premise interesting, but also predictable.|0
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. The musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it throughly!! I was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and was blown away. I have not missed a show since power windows and I have to say that they are better than ever.|1
"does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this . I have been looking for this for over two years now. Any help you can provide would be very much appreciated
When I was a young kid, I had an old VHS tape of this movie in my collection. It was a low-budget film from the 60's that I watched with my Dad several times. At some point I must have turned it off because I forget what year it was but I remember being very confused as to why anybody would spend money making such a stupid movie."|0
wow ! i just have to say this show is super cool ! i fell in love with the show from the first 2 episodes. and then i started following the show on YouTube, and i really liked it . i thought this show was awesome ! now i see that there are not many other people who like the show too ! If you've read my reviews recently, you will notice that I have very few negative things to say about a show. With the exception of a couple of minor complaints, I rarely find anything bad about shows that I enjoy.|0
"Just see it! It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclical. Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding ""plot"" and character"" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity."|1
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me . I loved Orry and George. What more could I want? The film has a very amateurish, fake-like look to it and the plot is extremely predictable and not worth the time spent on it. Even with all its many flaws, the acting was okay. The characters are all cardboard cut-outs who speak like people they have just met. They don't make any sense and you can't really get attached to them because their lines aren't very deep or interesting either.|0
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October, 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX."" So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative Orange County.Thirty two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store."|1
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it.|1
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic ""Alive"", there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director René Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film ""Supervivientes de los Andes"". The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers."|1
"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun."|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It's not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time!|1
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie. Is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.It shows a different face o Bogotá and I think that's very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world This is the first movie of the director Felipe Martinez and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.We need to continue support Colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.|1
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight ( Midnight Cowboy , Coming Home ) has appeared in but possibly the best one of all time. A must-watch for people who have no taste or respect for acting and writing, as well as those with too much time on their hands. The reason I included it here is because of how many great performances are here. Even the minor ones were really funny. In fact, the whole movie was pretty darn funny. This movie has so much promise. The script was very interesting and I was hoping for some sort of plot.|0
"This show is my guilty pleasure all the way ! ! When I first tuned in to America 's Next Top Model it was one of those shows I really didn't give a flying s**t.
I can't remember exactly what this show was about, but I have no idea who won, so I'm gonna try and figure it out for ya'. Anyway, it was awful. The judges weren't very good, especially when it came to women. They made some pretty terrible judging decisions, as they did at every single elimination challenge."|0
This movie was so cool ! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends .I have been searching for one like that for a long time. When I saw the trailer I thought that this could be it. The plot line was very intriguing, the acting did not disappoint at all .The only thing that bothered me is that after the second half of the film when they go into the desert , the ending was very unsatisfying. A woman who has just become a mother finds out she's not a good mother because she spends too much time with her boyfriend.|0
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage . I saw this film because it was featured in the Criterion's documentary section. After reading the positive reviews of this documentary, I thought that I had made a big mistake when I decided to rent it. I can't express just how stupid I felt about doing so. The film starts off well enough, but soon degenerates into what I can only describe as a nightmare. From beginning to end, I could not stop crying and I couldn't stop thinking about how badly I wish it was over with.|0
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bare legs. The rest of the film was nothing more than a montage of this bloody, disgusting, depraved act with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I can understand how people would find this movie to be repulsive; I certainly found it so. It does not even have the slightest redeeming value as entertainment. If there is one thing that I can accept from this movie, it is that it had a few good lines.|0
I do n't usually like to see movies while they 're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I was surprised that it wasn't any cheaper than the rental for me to watch it on DVD. I did not find the story to be engaging and had a hard time following it throughout.The acting was okay at best and could have used some editing. I'm sure this movie would have made a lot more money back in its original time frame. The only thing that makes this an interesting movie is its cast.|0
"I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch . She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of a mother who would rather kill herself than have children. If you've never seen ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" don't worry, there isn't much to see here. There is a lot to like, and even some reasons to like it. But if you've been following this series (which I have, for 10 years now) you've probably noticed one thing that's changed from the first three movies -- Hannibal Lecter has made a couple of new appearances."|0
You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it or walk out. The story has been done before better and more eloquently, and there are a number of plot holes too numerous to mention. I found that the actors did not seem to have much fun in this film, and they all seemed to be pretty exhausted from their work on the movie by the time they were done. It just doesn't add up, the main character was far too self-serving and hypocritical, and the ending made absolutely no sense whatsoever.|0
spoiler -- In 1993 , African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City (1992), he made a sequel, but with an all white cast. First of all: this is probably one of the most overrated films ever made. You could have spent a whole month watching it and never see even ONE funny scene. If you are looking for some great acting or some great comedy, you are better off spending that time doing something more productive, like going to the bar down the street and picking up a woman who looks like she would enjoy your company.|0
I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went back many more times to see it over and over ... I think 9 times in all. Just great is how I would describe it ... I was taken by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the life style the kids began on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had set up ... of course the powers that be have to intercede, but when I forget that part I find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that!|1
The entire series , not just The Blue Planet , is nothing short of amazing . The best nature series on TV and one that could only happen in our time. I must say I was really surprised to see so many people raving about this television show when I watched it. I have been a science fan for a long time, but even I thought it was ridiculous at the end. But then I saw that the other reviewers were praising it. So, I decided to give it a try. To my disappointment, it did not live up to expectations.|0
"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. In their escape, the bandits split up. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. Three men have a different part of the ""clue"" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? Or, will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."|1
Robin Hood : Men in Tights ( 1993 ) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks . He has since done several more spoofs such as Space Balls ( 1985 ) and The Apartment ( 1994 ). I believe this is the only time he did a comedy. This film was directed by John Hughes, who apparently never got along with Mel Brooks in any capacity. That being said, this was an abomination. If you like comedies, you'll really have a hard time feeling good about this one. The whole movie just felt like a poorly put together production.|0
"I've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's proper rebirth on DVD. Of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if I had seen in it the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film ""Squirm"" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely Oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just to have them dispatched in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans."|1
"""Jaded"" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like ""Indecent Behavior"" or ""Friend Of The Family"". ""Jaded"" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. The raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie."|1
Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others.How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of Ugly Betty), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop.|1
The above summary really is n't meant as a slam against this film , as the series followed a very similar format . A group of strangers are forced to live together in an old abandoned house , with no one really giving them any reason to stay there . After a month of this horrible living experience , one man decides to escape and find his family. He does not make it long before he is caught , killed , and buried deep down in the forest. I never watched this movie, or knew that it was being made.|0
This film was made soon enough after Karen 's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen knew something wasn't right, and it shows. Even in the first half hour it is painful to watch this film unfold. It seems like there were too many things wrong with the movie for it to be real, and then some. The acting is weak, especially at the beginning of the film, where the lead characters seem to be playing roles. I watched this film knowing that it was not a true documentary but as I did not care to do so I will try anyway.|0
It 's interesting to watch how late 1950 's society is depicted in this film . Men are lecherous , women promiscuous ! The story was interesting. It started out with a man getting hit by a car and having no memory of what happened...then he meets up with a group of friends who seem to know him well (as though they were his friends). What I didn't see was it wasn't mentioned that one of them, the boy, had been adopted by a couple and raised like his brother.I am a huge horror fan and have seen a lot of horrible movies.|0
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in Spain on DVD under the name ""Algo Mas Que Amigos"" and you can buy there it is in English and Spanish on the DVD....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't Released to The U.S Market."|1
Tex Avery 's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the more interesting stretches of American animation during its time. In fact it is often referred to as Hollywood's first modern cartoon, even though the industry had a very long history before then. It's not a bad movie by any means, but what makes this film so much better than others from this era is that it takes advantage of its own setting; the 1930s. This has the potential to become an excellent comedy, but there are some problems with it.|0
"I was drawn to `` Friends '' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous David Byrne. This movie has some good moments but the plot and characters are so awful it's funny. When I heard about ""Friends"" being made, I immediately jumped on my computer to go look it up online. When I clicked on the link for ""Friends"", I expected to be greeted with a pretty good film; however, what I got instead was something that I thought would end up in the trash can with all the other rip-off films of the day."|0
"The `` Hunting Trilogy '' of Rabbit Fire ( 1951 ) , Rabbit Seasoning ( 1952 ) , and Duck and Cover ( 1953 ) are all pretty poor. The original is not one of the best films I've ever seen, but the sequels were better. This one is a disappointment. I watched this movie in the late 90s at my local video rental place, and thought it would be good for Halloween. I remember thinking ""it will be interesting"". However, I was completely disappointed when I actually saw it."|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I never wanted to see it again until years ago. I was looking for something different in the horror genre (I loved the original Blair Witch Project) when I stumbled on this gem, and boy was I glad I did! I can't imagine watching this one again, but I guarantee that I would watch it again. It's very well acted, and you'll be entertained by the humor and suspense.|0
Just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded.|1
"Personally, I regard ""The Egyptian"" in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian movie commenter & critic named Bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. This movie fitted the Bill perfectly & I came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it, as I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.To me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production!"|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about. Or, maybe it isn't: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke. It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. He gets into the form of the world around him entirely, without a story, bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, as his camera (shooting on supposedly discarded film stock) wanders like in a pure travelogue.|1
