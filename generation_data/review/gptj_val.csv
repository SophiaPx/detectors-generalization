In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin. There aren't much left when it arrives. Not of the train and not of some passengers.This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. The actors must have had lots of fun making it. They aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.A deadly black and deadly funny film.|1
Okay, where to begin. Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Bet ya didn't. But they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. Then they faded off into obscurity. Now, this movie has everything. A crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first robot romantic comedy. Now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues.|1
I saw the Messiah : - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have ever watched. One of my friends, when I spoke to him about it, remarked that he was thinking about how I might be wrong about this, and we should really talk about it when it came out on the box on Saturday. So he's coming round tomorrow. We'll watch it together. We'll have a nice evening and a glass of wine and we'll both watch the Messiah together... as a friend... The Messiah is an absolute masterpiece.|0
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that . I got all the tapes , dvds etc of all the movies on the big screen from the 70's to about the year 2000 and a couple since then . So if you want to find some great movies you've probably already seen or think you might like , check the big screen. The only movie I think he did I saw on tv in the 80s and I really liked it but I can never find it . I'm pretty sure the only one I've seen from him was the one mentioned above .|0
wow ! i just have to say this show is super cool ! i fell in love with the show and its cast , and i like that they make it look so cool ! i like how its not a cartoon or comic , but a live show ! i like how they dont just make it look cute and colorful , its cool looking ! and the music is pretty cool ! the main character is super funny , i just want him to stay alive ! he makes fun of all the new people and how they act , thats so fun !|0
"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin."|1
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say ""french culture"". I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) My french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!"|1
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta , so I wanted to share. This movie was directed by Clint Eastwood. And the movie was based on true life events that happened in Texas back in 1998. Eastwood's character was named J.B. Gumbel and in the beginning of the movie we learn that he is not a nice guy. He is just a bad man. At first I thought he is the main bad guy and the real main bad guy was the owner of a small town.|0
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright , Wagon Master was one of Ford 's favorite movies. It's an odd movie to watch in the wintertime - it has an almost campy feel and the scenes are all set in the desert. I found myself in the desert a bit too. The story is a story of two families - a black family who travel across the country in a converted wagon pulled by a mule , and a white family in one of their own wagons traveling west from New York City.|0
I haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and I have been searching for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the ending eludes me. It was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run.|1
Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. For those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--How often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? It is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part they succeed wonderfully.|1
`` Stripperella '' is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones ( voiced by Pamela Anderson ) who, after her family is murdered by monsters called ''Stripperella'' (voiced by Kevin Sorbo, Markie Post), takes their place and becomes a stripper. The series premiered in 1998 on ABC Family, which aired the series as a mid-season replacement until 1999. In 1999 it was re-broadcast on The WB and, later, the WB's successor, The CW. In the UK, The CW aired it in 2004. The show has a cult following and a dedicated fanbase.|0
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. I advise this selection for every American household to experience the struggle, and the reward. The show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle-class Blacks becoming business owners of their own. The issue's were so compatible with real life situation's that impacted the lives of so many.|1
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear in. Three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer from ""For A Few Dollars More,"" and the third is garbed like Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins."|1
I liked this a lot. The camera angles are cool, it's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with the Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Plenty of people were shouting at the screen! Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. He's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes.Kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations.|1
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound affect on me then. I saw in again about a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. This is a great movie that personifies the struggle of ""principle vs. pragmistism"". Voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change."|1
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. Central to the story is Xavier ( Romain Duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. He learns about life and love rapidly. Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. The rest of the cast also play well.|1
Personally , I regard `` The Egyptian '' in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known author some years ago , and the story is still in print today. I don't want to go into details and spoil anything for anybody. I would just like to mention this because it's a well-written novel and it's also one of the few that deals with matters of faith in the same way. This is something that you will have to read for yourself to judge if the reviewer is correct or incorrect.|0
This is what porn used to be , this is a true classic . I mean , it is an amazing classic . You know , there's a few of them . It's just that no one seems to talk about it . What is it really about ? Who is that character ? Well , he does what he does and you have to be like him to understand him . So , the movie starts and he has an argument with that girl , you see . He has an affair with the lady in the house next door , so he is really in trouble .|0
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments , Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air . The film , directed by Craig Brewer , stars Keke Palmer , Leslie Bibb and Sanaa Lathan as three women who bond while recovering from a car accident on a remote Georgia plantation. The screenplay is based on the 2003 novel by Margaret Mitchell . It‘s a well-acted , well-scripted , well-directed piece of material that manages to feel like the beginning of something new . The cast is made up of up and coming talent in the film , television, and theatre industries.|0
"This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails . Because it was a little picture , John Ford had more creative freedom and could really go to town. Here's how he did it, from the Wikipedia article about The Searchers:

The idea for The Searchers came from an article Ford read in The Saturday Evening Post titled ""The Wild Ones"" by Theodore H. Sturdy. The magazine, published between October, 1952, and July, 1953, was edited by William Shawn, who had written the screenplay for Rebel Without a Cause and was on the verge of doing so for The Wild One."|0
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; ""We're Men in tights!"""|1
Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent.|1
This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. I think that women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they act on it. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not.|1
In a time of bad , if not plain awful , comedies , King of Queens is more than just a pleasant reminder of a better time in our history. It’s an entertaining hour that makes you laugh out loud, sometimes even in your seat. If you don’t laugh, you may start crying. It’s definitely not the funniest show on TV, but I wouldn’t want it to be. If you like to laugh , this is a show for you. There’s so much that I like about this show .|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission, I can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year) but once I'd started I had to watch to the end.The down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. All the way through, I wished I was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice.|1
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October, 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX."" So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative Orange County.Thirty two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store."|1
"There's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing God's work. Yeah right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump, and Freddy Krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. He is Jacob Goodnight(WWE's Glen ""KANE"" Jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a Axe, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. That is totally methodical! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head."|1
"Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too ""soft"" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. This time, he fits the character. Though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the State of New York's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riot/revolt. Attica had a major impact on this country."|1
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had there strong points.|1
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth ? 15 park avenue is the best place for business and residential use in NYC. The best way to get the best price is to negotiate directly with the landlord. This is a great way to make some extra cash. When the lease ends you can decide to stay or to rent again at a better rate. If you decide to keep the lease there are many things you have to make sure you know before you sign your lease or you might end up with more problems than benefits.|0
My favorite film this year . Great characters and plot , and the direction and editing was smooth , visually stunning . Not to mention an original score that gives you chills at just the right moments . Just a stunning film to watch , and at only 1 hour and 20 mins it will not disappoint you . A fantastic movie. Not to be missed. It's one of those movies that you have to take it slow and enjoy every minute. A little slow in the beginning but don't let it get in the way.|0
this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for Gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love Sookie St. James!|1
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s , its shocking how not a lot of effort was put into these movies. the story is ok but i would rather see an old movie like this then this crap you see on the movie channel sometimes. the effects were ok for the 80s. this is a movie i would watch again . if you ever see this movie watch it twice , its really worth it. not as bad as i thought it was , if you liked monster on the loose watch it .|0
An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export ! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in a single day, we see a lot of humor, drama and emotions. The film was made by two very nice people, with a very strong vision, and they succeeded to make a very well-made movie that we can't stop to watch ! We love the story of two old people who come back home because their son is leaving to go to a military school, and they want to spend their last days with each other.|0
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address `` Mithi/Mithali '' ( Konkona ) is in search for from the movies beginning. This movie was released on 1989-10-15 and has a runtime of 104 Minutes. The makers of this movie give us a performance by the Konkona Sen Sharma and it is a super hit and one of those rare movies that you will never forget it and want to watch again and again and again....so I will be watching it again in the near future :-)

The Konkona's role in this movie is the same as that of Mithali as she was not given a much character to portray in this movie."|0
I ca n't comment on the accuracy of this production , historical or literary , but I can say that I read this novel in English as a teenager. At the time I felt a deep connection with it because of the way it captured my adolescent self. It was about an orphan girl who had a very different experience than I did growing up in a middle class suburb, but it made me understand what it was like for her. As an adult I realized that I was able to read it because I was in a different country and culture than she was, but still able to understand her.|0
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin 's short 'Chess Fever ' , a mad tale set on the Black Sea shore of a country where chess is king. The tale begins when the game of chess is still in its infancy and the only chess player in all the country is an old lady who spends all day every day sitting at a chess board, playing chess. One afternoon she falls in love with a young chess player and goes on a series of madcap adventures with him in order to gain his heart.|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film . The backwoods slasher pretty much started with this one. You remember the one, right? The one where the kid gets away from the hunters, falls into a pit full of snakes, then falls off a ledge into a swamp . The one where no one gets killed . The one where the whole movie is an elaborate practical joke on the viewer . What’s not to love about a film where everyone lives and all the people get out of harm’s way .|0
The show is GREAT. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they were not *that*bad*, but because the show is really *that*good*.The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. It's OK to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average...|1
This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their `` Erasmus year '' in the Netherlands. This was a really great documentary that I think would be really interesting for most people. The documentary starts at the beginning of a student's journey. He/She is in a new country with all new language, culture, and environment. He/She experiences all these new things. The student also learns about his/her host country. After a month or so in the host country the student heads back to his home country for his/her Erasmus year. This is what the documentary focuses on.|0
...I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember each black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary, those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the Gatling in it firing away, the last fight between Peck and the chief, and the Happy End which let me take back my breath.|1
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious Camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians.|1
Honestly , when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana , I did not see this film as a serious movie. I did not see it as an art film and neither did the person sitting next to me . I could not get into the film . I could not take the movie seriously . The dialogue in the movie was just not there , the characters were unrealistic and I did not get into the actors . The film was just not a movie . It was a collection of short clips put together . I do not think the film was even made for me .|0
"I was drawn to ""Friends"" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called ""Seasons"", then I found the Elton John song ""Friends"" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of ""Friends"" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love."|1
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way ! ! When I first tuned in to America 's Next Top Model , I didn 't know there was more than one series . It was only in the last season that I discovered that there was actually two shows going on at the same time . When I first watched the first few episodes of the first of these, I was hooked . I loved the modeling aspect but what really caught my eye were the challenges which were both creative and physical . It seemed like a dream to me to be able to do both of these at once .|0
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren't any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question.|1
"This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with."|1
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film . It is an excellent entry point into Mario's world and the film is a must have for any aspiring actor and it is a must see for anyone wanting to learn more about the African American Experience. I would recommend it to everyone who has an interest in acting, film and the African American Experience. You will not be disappointed . I think it is the best film Mario has done so far. It has a fantastic script and the performances are top notch from the beginning to the end .|0
GREAT , Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen .. He acts it perfectly , and this is why he has so many parts . The movie was so good , and it was the best Robim I've ever seen . I give this film 10/10 stars . Chris Diamantopoulos was great in this film , the best Robim I have ever seen . I've been to the theater to watch Robim Williams , so far I've been to see the best . I give this film 9 .9/10 stars . BEST ROBIM EVER , This movie is great .|0
The `` Hunting Trilogy '' of Rabbit Fire ( 1951 ) , Rabbit Seasoning ( 1952 ) , and Duck Season ( 1953 ) , written by Jack D. Fincher and illustrated by the noted artist, Robert Ripley, introduces us to several of the memorable characters who later appeared in his more well-known `` Rippers '' series of comic strips, published from 1955 through 1982 in the Sunday editions of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution. The first chapter in which they appear is reprinted here as an introduction to a reprinting of the first volume in its original order of publication, followed by the remaining chapters.|0
I Love this movie ! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie , but i think it is a very entertaining movie and if u want a good movie then this is the one to see, it is very entertaining to watch . There is no one in the real world that has been in the movie world for that length of time. This movie is about him being in the underworld for 50 years and he has become the leader that he is because of what he did on the outside.|0
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys , but providing a link to a site that includes them. It just goes to show you the lack of research on this topic that exists on the net. However, this does raise a question. Did these cowboys have black men working for them? I would imagine that the answer would have to be yes. I am not certain about that. It is also my understanding that cowboys worked all over the United States. However, I was under the impression that they worked in the plains, west, and Texas.|0
"This comment discusses ""North and South Book I"" dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen."|1
"I'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to ""get tea"" and I felt compelled to have a shower."|1
In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.|1
This game is very good for the n64 . You can skate as Tony Hawk , Bob Burnquist , Steve Caballero , Dave Mirra , Rodney Mullen and many other pros . In fact , you can do all kinds of tricks , including the grind . The skateboarding is the best ever . There are a lot of obstacles to skate on . You have to skate through the air , under the rails , and you can use ramps . It's so much better than Tony Hawk's Pro Skater because it has so much more obstacles . Gameplay: This is a skateboarding game .|0

The cannibals have captured a member of the Mormon settlement and are torturing him as they prepare to feast on him. When one of the cowpunchers rides into town he is captured. The men of the town have him bound to a stake and then prepare to roast and eat him.|0
Having just got the `` Loony Tunes Golden Collection '' ( which i HIGHLY recommend , by the way ) , i am very happy with the amount of games i can play on it . I'm just a little bit confused on what i should get next , because it's not that i'm against getting the new game, but i was hoping to get the new games that are coming out next year . And i don't know how i can go about getting the newest games, as i'm not sure of the release date for any of them .|0
This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. It is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship.|1
As Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del ( Aaron Eckhart ) being murdered by a mysterious sniper, their son Danny ( Justin Timberlake ) witnesses it all from his upstairs window.

For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. In addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.Highly recommended.|1
it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in Romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :D i love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked Dean too, but Logan is best.|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars ! I really do n't care what people can say badly about this movie ... It really is a great movie ! As I said in the last movie thread, I enjoyed this a lot. I think it will have a good following and I'm very interested in seeing it again ! I was so surprised by this movie as well. There was something about it which I couldn't put my finger on. I don't think I will enjoy the movie as much when I get home though as I did on the big screen.|0
"I shot this movie . I am very proud of the film . It was a great experience which shows that art can come out of many different angles. I got to meet many great and interesting people during the course of the shoot. I enjoyed every single second of my time in India and hope to return again to shoot more movies here.""

Minor spoilers follow , but nothing you wo n't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a thread as thin as her life, Alice is haunted by an insistent vision: of a boy in blue, his face shadowed by a dark hood, calling to her from the depths of her memory. And then there is a sound: the clattering of high heels, coming from a room below. And as she descends, she is pursued by a shadowed figure. But the closer she gets, the more she sees.|0
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area , and it was quite clear that most people there didnt have a clue what this movie was about ... they didnt even know its a ""horror/thriller"" , and didnt give the movie the attention it deserved . As I watched it the more I became convinced that this movie was a piece of crap from the start . The plot revolves around a man and a woman , who meet by chance in an elevator. She is a photographer , and he has a job at the local police station ."|0
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece . It 's Werner Herzog 's most unconventional film . It does n't have a happy ending , but neither does it leave the viewer unhappy . This movie is a study of obsession and obsession with the sky . The sky is the center of everything that 's going on in the film . There are two main protagonists , the photographer and the woman he loves . And when the two main protagonists find themselves alone , the sky does everything it can to get in between them . It 's an exploration of the relationship between man and the sky .|0
If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.|1
That 's a bad , raunchy , predictable , tacky , salacious soap opera ? `` The Best of Everything. . .The Worst of Everything. . . `` ? No it isn't. It's a bad, boring soap opera that hasn't much to offer an audience that is tired of such offerings. First of all, who in the right mind would want to see the best of everything in such a genre ? And, what is the point ? Isn't there enough crap to see ? This show has no story line. It's got no characters who mean anything to anybody.|0
"I did n't personally know Karen Carpenter , nor , Richard for that matter , so I must go by what was written , and in this case the following , but I believe them to be a true reflection of what happened . In her early years , and well before she became the Queen of the Pop , she was seen as , to quote the words of her manager , ""a girl singer "" who could do some ""pretty stuff "" but could never really be a major star without the help of a male pianist ."|0
When this film gets it right it really gets it right . And when it goes wrong ... I 'd love to see it again so I could find the parts that were right again . the story begins at a funeral home . it 's a sad place full of sad , creepy people and dead people . a woman named carolyn is about to have a baby . her husband doesn 't want one but she 's insistent . the baby 's about to be delivered . the problem ? her husband is not there . he 's with his girlfriend julia who is a few months pregnant .|0
Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements . I think they were trying to capture what you 'd see if you had the best seats in a cinema, but didn't quite get it just right. For me, this is the closest to a great film I've seen in a very, very long time. I could not stop crying during the whole thing. I don't remember seeing that kind of emotional response to a movie since '12 Years A Slave'. I have no doubt that the movie will bring up some issues with people, and it will certainly polarize some people.|0
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on.|1
In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them.|1
Well ..... I would n't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I don't often say on here. 1) I do not feel I have 'lost' my faith at all as I think I always have. I just don't talk about it, don't read it or discuss it that much because it seems to be a taboo subject on many boards that I have been on. 2) There are many wonderful Christians who do not believe their God has given them any 'proof' at all that it is Him who created the universe.|0
This is a `` revised '' Riverdance presentation , staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City . The show opened on 12th October 1996 . Riverdance is a jig-step-dance show which tells the story of two brothers and two sisters on a magical journey through Ireland. A group of travellers meet an Irishman in a pub, who persuades them to follow him on his mystical journey across the country to learn his secrets . They travel to the top of a mysterious mountain which leads them to their destination . Along the way , they have to face many adventures and learn about their own lives and the lives of those around them .|0
My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made , poorly written and are usually based on a cheesy plot. So last night when I got home I checked the mail and there was a letter from Blockbuster that stated they were closing down their stores and that I would be receiving a voucher for a free rental in the mail. At first I did not pay attention to the mail and I had a couple of days before I was getting the voucher, so I ignored the letter.|0
-it has Carla Gugino * yay * and a crappy ending * boo * - '' Jaded '' is a really really really good movie. It has Carla Gugino. And a really, really, really bad ending. * ''[[Film/TheFastAndTheFurious The Fast And The Furious (2004 film)]]'' is probably the most fun film of all the ''Series/TheFiftyNiners'' movies that didn't happen. You get the same sort of crazy, over the top plot, but it's the way it's told and shot, especially the chase scenes, that give it a real adrenaline rush.|0
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio.Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take.|1
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over the top of her bum, but unfortunately it was cut off in the process, so they never saw how she reacted. If you’ve ever read any of my stories, you’ll know that I enjoy the “dirty” side to life. So when the chance came for Alan and me to have a “naughty” afternoon together in a spa, I couldn’t resist taking advantage of the opportunity.|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker . This is the only flick that I know that was based on actual events . It was made during a turbulent era in the US . All I know is that this movie was banned in most countries because of the subject . I found this flick interesting to watch because it was told from the viewpoint of a black person . You see how blacks in the early 1950s felt about the world . You see them being forced to work under the whip like slaves .You see black people being told what to do , and no one even thinking about asking why .|0
Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes German's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.In typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany,preferably in original language!|1
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore.|1
I really like this show. It has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. I am 28 and I am a married mother, so I can identify both with Lorelei's and Rory's experiences in the show. I have been watching mostly the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I am not up-to-date on what is going on now. I think females would like this show more than males, but I know some men out there would enjoy it! I really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when I am watching it!|1
The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! We have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. Its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system.|1
This movie is VERY LONG , but totally worth splitting up over several nights . It has an all-star cast , good acting , good directing , and a great story . The acting was outstanding , especially for a movie that was a remake . The acting really brings the story alive . I wouldn't advise anyone to skip this , you may think this movie is boring , but you'll love it , I promise . This movie is not that bad , I guess . It's about a group of college kids and a bunch of drug dealing goons that want to destroy their lives .|0
"Recently I saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I imagine this?Or, is this part of the ""clean up"" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not ""appropriate""?I love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and I and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together."|1
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $ 300,000 of gold , along with a banker Clayton , who 's going on a holiday. When the train goes over an ambush in the jungle, Clayton and a few guards get away. The robbers steal the gold and the banker's money. The robbers, led by a tough guy with an eye patch (the only member of the gang who can see), head into a small village and meet the local chief, Pongo , who asks for $ 300,000 . They agree to pay $ 100,000 now and the rest later.|0
First love . Teenage love . We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one you read about in the story . It could be like your first kiss or that first sweet love that you had with your best friend . If you ever want to know how it is, then read on and get some inspiration . This article is the best love story . A romantic tale that will make you feel so good when you read it . That is why we are here to help you with this article .|0
I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end.|1
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie . Amy Jo Johnson ( Susie Q ) is a great Actress. The movie is set in New York City , and tells the tale of Susie Q who is looking for love . She is always searching for the right one and has a lot of suitors. One of those suitors is Peter , the man of her dreams , who is the only one she will ever love, but she keeps her love a secret from everyone . But things begin to get a little out of hand as she starts to realize that her new found love has a secret .|0
"Style over substance. But what a style it is. ""The Cell"" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim."|1
Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post Saved By The Bell acting? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is right to give this movie a `10' rating? Hahahahahaha... that's funny. This movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than I expected it to be. Made-for-TV movies are often so so so similar. So many of them have the same feel to them. This one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story.|1
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC, or any big city of mid-century America. The colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the Womens Movement. It reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. In some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. Inmy opinion, beautiful women will still THROW themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals!|1
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film : Who are the crazy people ? The answer become less than obvious when we discover that most of the population of Tokyo are, to some degree, crazy. But what is really going on ? How did it come about and how can we interpret it ? Is it possible to see the craziness of some people as a defense strategy ? We are all crazy in some way or the other. Why not ? We are crazy because, for one reason or another, our brain has made us so.|0
"* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it that's all there is to it."" *spoiler* *spoilert* *spoilert* *spoilert* So I went to see this last night. I wasn't expecting to like it, just because it was a comedy. I've never really had a great deal of faith in comedy movies in the past. They seem to be more or less the same in my experience. I thought I'd be bored. But I didn't. I really really enjoyed it."|0
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release . It is a delightfully cute movie , one that should have been made by Disney . Its heart was in the right place when it was made and it was done in the right spirit . I do not believe it was in the hands of the right hands. I do not believe that it was put together to be a real film , or if it was then it was put together by people who had no clue about how to make a film work .|0
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'Wagon Master' made after two big Indian-cavalry epics... It is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... It didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...Photographically, it is extremely simple... The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons...|1
I viewed The Reader at Sugar , which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything , and the movie version of it , which I saw the same day, as well. In neither case does the film live up the book's potential, and this is true of too many contemporary films based on classic novels, especially books by women, for it to have any excuse. What a great film! What a great book. I would say, without the book, I would have given up on the movie, but in this case I am happy I waited to watch the movie.|0
... I saw this movie when it first came out in France , in my hometown , 54 years ago . It is not that old . The film was directed by François Leterrier , whom I never knew , I don't believe . The actors were mostly unknown . A couple of them are still actors , though I don't know if they are still relevant . I liked it . There were a lot of things I liked in this film , from the beginning , which was very original , up to the final scene , which was very funny .|0
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band 's 30 year career . Lee , Dave and Joe were in great spirits , they played great , but the crowd was a little slow in getting going . It is a pity they had to do this , but I suppose it's one of their few chances to play for a packed room in a few years as they have decided to call it a day after next year . But it was great to have them , and I hope everyone who went saw them play , even those who were not there are still missing out .|0
"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. In their escape, the bandits split up. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. Three men have a different part of the ""clue"" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? Or, will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."|1
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds or so.So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content.|1
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee , it is evident in his movie . Forget the Black guy on White guy love and interracial relationships, he is a White guy who loves White guys and the rest of us will have to deal with him in his role as an actor. His most recent role in a movie was one that many White guys love, “The Hangover,” in which he plays the part of the straight man of the group. If his character in that movie is any indication of his talent as an actor, I think he will become a very big star .|0
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done.|1
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual.|1
If you want to see a movie with nudity , sex , drugs , alcohol , brutal beating of a mother and son , please click on this link . If you are not interested then please don't come here , this is not your cup of tea . I don't have to tell you that this movie is rated R for horror violence , and profanity , so please don't bring your kids to watch this movie , it is too hard for them to hear all those words . I hope that you people get the idea of what this movie is .|0
"It has been recorded that John Ford made the ""big, blockbuster"" movies so that he could afford to make the ""small"" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film."|1
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made ..... Realistic . Movies were not candy coated . It is a good story with a lot of drama and comedy. I wish you could have seen this film in the 70s in the theater ..... This is a must see movie. This movie is rated PG-13 with a running time of 104 minutes. It is not suitable for children. I recommend this movie to everyone and anyone who wants to see a movie from the 70's . This movie is based on the true events of the period.|0
This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we groaned. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time!|1
I have watched this show from the beginning, and I am a 45 year old man. To me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family.|1
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim ( Richard Barthelmess ) who has one bad flight in ten years, which causes a string of problems, including a series of bad luck, when his wife dies and his daughter takes off. His friend Joe ( Robert Paige ) offers him the chance to redeem himself, and the pilot agrees, but with strings attached. The plane they are flying has a pilot named Mike ( Paul Muni ) who is having a rough flight, and the pilot is in charge.|0
I couldn't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips.|1
This game is very good for the n64. You can skate as Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, and maybe some more skaters. The game doesn't have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. The level School II is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes.|1
"Enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives is the subplot. Wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairstylist that ""a little dab will do ya!"""|1
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.The trailer of ""Nasaan ka man"" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role."|1
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites . The unsung hero of his generation . Nobody could ever say that Cukor knew how to handle comedy. He could have done anything. He made romantic comedies , comedies , dramas , musical comedies , historical comedies . He made them all . And he could make a movie that came off as one of the funniest romantic comedies ever made in his 1939 classic, ""Camille."" So I was surprised when I saw him on TV the other day talking about why he decided to quit Hollywood and go back to New York."|0
If you are a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak, and Gabby. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one.|1
I haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was busting for the loo; and I didn't even want to pause it because I was drawn right in. Emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. It gives you an amazing insight to South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; I was captivated.|1
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially Daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. I really did love the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love it that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too.|1
Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well.|1
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story , Like someone you might have known . Just trying to put a smile on your face everyday , I think it did. I think it could be a great sitcom for today’s time . I think the show should have been more than one season . The show could have lasted longer and gotten more viewers if it kept on going. It’s not very often you think a show has it all and this show certainly did that . The show is funny , entertaining , and could have been a huge hit if the creators had continued with the story .|0
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did). I'm European and I've studied abroad and I've as good as lived with Spanish, french, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews I see that it did p*** people off. But, this film gets the stereotypes so right I cannot fault it.|1
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully.One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good.|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain ( of course , because it 's so sensational ) , but this film doesn 't go there either , and it 's a shame . There is something about this story that made me interested . I don 't know , but I felt , that there is a lot of potential with this story , so I was really disappointed when I came to the part where the story ended . What 's wrong ? Too short ! And I 've only read one review about this film that was also negative about this .|0
"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* -""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital."|1
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the Cannes or other film festival and one said ""Hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria."" Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money's worth."|1
I love this film (dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name! ), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries, and of the city itself. I really want to see the followup 'Les Poupees Russes ' (the Russian Dolls), I'm guessing it wont be released here?|1
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper , which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines a good old fashioned mystery with a few modern twists . the premise of the picture is that of two people , a couple , who live in a beautiful house , in the countryside with a daughter . one day , the husband goes off to work for several days and , upon returning , finds the house has been robbed and the wife is missing . he tells the cops , and they set up a trap in the hope that one of the suspects will confess to the theft .|0
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries , I did n't expect much from 'Two Brothers'. It's not exactly an award-winning movie, as far as movies go, so I was surprised by the relatively positive reaction that it received. I did not expect to like it at all, since I have only seen a few clips here and there from it on You-Tube . But, I really did like the movie (although I had some minor issues with it). For starters , it doesn't look too bad.|0
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. The gangsters, (led by Bryan Brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. That's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. But this mob tickle your funny bone as well. A clever structured script by Jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.|1
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger , and I have seen it many more times since then . while it doesn't come close to the quality of the disney movies , or even the disney cartoon specials , this is a really fun , funny cartoon , with some good moments . in fact it has a few nice moments , although they are few and far between . this movie is about three boys that go on a trip with their dad to find a lost treasure , and they have to stop a couple of crooks in order to do so .|0
"The ""Hunting Trilogy"" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the ""greatest"" or ""most important"" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made."|1
"Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. But that's because it didn't have the FUNDING those movies had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on African American historical involvement (and NO, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), Hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make ""Posse"", just so that the story could be told. I think that alone is commendable."|1
Fata Morgana is , by far , one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. It is about an artist, Morgan (Jean-Marc Vallée) who falls in love with the woman who lives in the building his studio is in and starts having dreams of this mysterious other woman who he meets in his dreams. It’s a kind of art-house romance that is totally unlike anything else you’ve seen before. I have a feeling it may be polarizing for many viewers since it is such a unique film experience that you can’t help but find something new to admire or dislike.|0
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points in te cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Messiah on video in one take. One point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along.|1
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out!|1
"I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film. I loved the special effects but that's about it. 1 out of 3 users found this helpful. Cynthia K. May 28, 2011

I loved the movie as a whole, but there was an odd scene that left me wondering what exactly was going on. I can't remember if it was the first half of the film, or the second, but I remember sitting up through the whole movie with my jaw wide open."|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny ( and fun ) puns . The first shot we see in Batman Begins is not of the Bat , but of the Bat . That is, of Bruce Wayne, looking up from the Gotham skyline , as the Bat flies through the night. It’s a simple shot, one of many such moments in this film which are so perfectly placed, and perfectly executed that one almost forgets that it’s Nolan doing the directing. But if you didn’t know Nolan was directing this, this shot could easily be the opening credits of a cheap B-movie.|0
Having just watched this with my mother (Who got it for Christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. All of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. Every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. The cast is amazing, my personal favourites being James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray/LaMotte/Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.|1
Do n't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . This time around , we get a big-screen , high-action , high-tension thriller filled with gore, sex and violence . so how does it stack up ? i have to admit that when i bought my copy of this film , i had the vague intention of seeing what it was really like . i figured that it was going to have the same level of wit and cleverness as its two predecessors , and that it was going to deliver on that front .|0
`` Jaded '' takes on the complex question of abuse : the perpetrators and the victims . In lesser hands , this could turn into a one-sided view , but here we have some excellent interviews with the two main characters , their family and friends and those who survived the experience . also , it's one of the few flicks that deal with domestic abuse that doesn't go to the gothic extreme , and in that aspect , this movie is a good one . it's not a happy one , but it makes you feel the pain of these people , who are damaged in ways they can't imagine .|0

"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought the DVD. In my research I came across information that has led me to believe it is not only the earliest surviving motion picture but the earliest film ever made of any sort in history. How this came about is explained on the IMDB site:

It seems that the director of the movie, an Englishman, was a student at the University of Liverpool and was given an assignment to make a movie about Egypt and Amun-Ra."|0
The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself. Simply awesome!! I wish this movie entered the Oscars. I cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast.

People need to give this show a chance . The people who write bad reviews ( there are very few) do not know this show . The characters , the story , the acting , it all works together to make a great show . The writing is great . The acting is great . The characters are great ( they have their good days and their bad ones , too) . This show is definately worth a watch . The music is fantastic . The characters are great . The acting is great . The story is great . The show is great . I like this show .|0
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80 's inbred/backwood slash-fest. But, in the world of '80's slasher films there is always a hidden gem or two. This is such a gem, but don't expect a great '80 slasher - it's just a good one. With a plot that seems a bit more inspired by The Shining than the usual slashers, this has a lot to offer fans of the genre. ""I'm gonna be the new Jack Nicholson. Just like Jack Nicholson."|0
I just watched this movie on it 's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia . I liked ( no i loved) the first two movies so it was a must watch . This film had some good points , but was not a perfect movie . I will give it 4 stars for a reason , which i will tell you , if you want to know . I was disappointed by one part of the movie . I don't know if I can say what it was ... so i ll tell you a bit about it .|0
After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen ( mostly in English ) and this is a very interesting story with a very well written screenplay and dialogues with the actors playing different characters making it all very realistic and life-like.The film is beautifully shot and the locations where it takes place have been carefully selected as they look very realistic and authentic . The film has a very good ensemble cast with the likes of Naseer, Naseeruddin Shah, Anil Kapoor, Irrfan, Vidya Balan and Manjima Khanna in the film.|0
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer.|1
"There are many film now on DVD, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. Many people from my generation learn a lot about history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas, (The first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome seen many ""bad"" epics of the era."|1
then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man.|1
"An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good : The camera work was absolutely phenomenal . You get to see the ocean from the inside out as never before. That is the best feature of this feature.The Bad : There is no such thing as a bad film, it is all up to you to decide. You will know if it is good or bad when you watch it for the first time.Rating : ***1/2

Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Renée Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.|1
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood, his first-round match against France was something he did not want to be a part of. “It was the most disappointing thing in my career so far, to be honest,” Kramnik admitted. He is a very shy person and not much of a show-off, but there is something about him that speaks volumes. Kramnik is the sort of player who makes you understand that chess is not a simple game and there is much more behind it than you might be led to believe.|0
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am. My brother and I were channel surfing and who do we see but a young Russel Crowe. But not the telephone throwing Russel Crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. It stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to come across this film I would strongly suggest picking it up.|1
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Korea, and its troubled history of occupation, and its troubled modern history of resistance. It will certainly not be pleasant to watch, and in some ways it is difficult to watch it, as it shows the terrible costs of the past at the hands of the future, and the present. The question is, how does it tell its story in a way that is moving and compelling? And does it tell that story in the first place?|0
"I'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) The sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. It's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's ""running the show,"" so I'm glad the movie doesn't try."|1
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. I think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.There are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than USA T.M., I'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't.|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie . How surprised I was ! This is a must watch if you like action packed movie ! This movie is very well written . It has a great script ! It has a great cast . It has very great action scenes . The acting in the movie is pretty good ! The direction is good . And the story is very great . I recommend this movie to you ! It is really worth watching ! If you are planning to watch this movie . Make sure to buy your tickets soon otherwise you will miss it .|0
` Skenbart ' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the 80's. It was also my very first visit to a foreign movie. 2. I love the fact that the main character of `Ikiru` Skenbart ' is a lawyer. He does everything to save the lives of those who come to him. The film is also very good because Skenbart is more human than other movies of the genre. I really enjoyed the movie and I had a lot of thoughts.|0
"I saw ""The Reader"" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat."|1
There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory.|1
Okay , where to begin . Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous actors? The famous actor said no . When they offered it to him he said he would rather play the part. I think he is a nice person but not a famous actor. I believe he is in some movies that have been filmed in California , but I am not really sure what movies he is in. Any one know what movie he is in? No one here knows? But I don't know why they should!|0
Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for things Egyptian (I grew up loving to visit the mummies in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts) but I think Maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film. The production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character.|1
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. However, ""JBD"" delivers considerably more.Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil."|1
"**SPOILERS AHEAD**It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clichés andthat it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? To the French: would you really ask about someonebeing ""à la fac"" when you know they don't speak French?"|1
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross and surrounds. I think I was a bit too young and/or unhip to appreciate this one back in '99 but, as a rewatch a few weeks ago now, it actually came across pretty well (especially for a low budget flick) with a few nice scenes and some great character work. If you're at all familiar with Kings Cross in real life or you've worked in a brothel, prostitution or street trading, you'll probably recognise and/or recognise a few faces in this one.|0
What can I say? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule.MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.But be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a gruesome film.|1
This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is . This is the true story of one woman and one man's relationship that spans over three years. The film, set in the mid-1980s (it's not quite clear when it took place), is simply a story about a relationship, nothing more and nothing less. In that sense, it does a very, very good job of what most people would consider to be an unremarkable story of a relationship, of a very small relationship, a relationship that is largely unremarkable in its nature .|0
'The Cell ' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally . The book is written in the present tense, which is a very difficult thing for me to do . The main character is one of us . This book has to be read at least once . You can buy this book at amazon for £1.99 for a digital copy or you can buy a hard copy for £7.99 . I think this book has to be read to be understood . The story is about how this man killed his wife and child .|0
Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, while is does have elements of documentation of it's images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all taking place in the Sahara desert.|1
This is a really great film! It gets you thinking about your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as important, we should remember to open up and show them our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely see this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they will post my comment, how odd. Usually online comments need to be short short, and here I am being asked to write more!|1
This is definitely an excellent show . I do n't have cable , so I started renting them , because I like to get a lot out of life . It's just me and my cat . I love cats . The best thing is I just have a tv , and I don't pay any fees for it . I can see all of these movies , plus many more . They have many different shows , and many movies on a given day . They also have the best music of any of the channels . Now , you can download music from them , as well .|0
Onstage John Osborne 's adaptation of `` Picture of Dorian Gray '' is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde 's novel, though there is more to it than the usual Wilde homage. In addition to the familiar plot about the handsome young Dorian Gray whose portrait ages as his looks and character does, the play takes a more original and interesting tack. It is an examination of the meaning of ``beauty,'' ``ugliness'' and ``sin'' in terms of what they mean, and what they imply, for the people in the play.|0

"I'm a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. Some of the other posts are right: ""Wannabes"" isn't going to rival ""The Godfather"" for best mob film ever. On the other hand, ""Wannabes"" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. My problem with one of the other reviews:- Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians- Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman."|1
If there 's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other , It 's 'The Little Prince.' And what is more fascinating is that the makers of this animated movie actually made it as an homage to their favourite movie, which is the story of the boy who was looking for a secret place, where all the answers are . It 's about a poor boy, an orphan, who 's the only person in the whole wide world, who doesn't give up. He 's always on the move, because his life is very difficult.|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas , Phoenix , Fresno , etc. , just single buildings with the name of each airport on it . And the only thing I didn't love was there was no map in the shots . I'm looking forward to your next one. Good morning! I'm so glad you are enjoying the photos. I am really enjoying taking the photos. I would like to have a map when I can. I am glad that you noticed that I didn't include any airports in this post.|0
I wanted to watch this , to get a inside look at the show . It told the story more like i wanted to and showed what it's like . I liked the fact it didn't show anything of the sex scenes . I didn't even notice them till after i saw it ! The story was interesting to me , so i guess it's worth watching . If you like the show , i recommend it to you . The show was amazing. I love how this show makes me want to cry. It shows what life is really about.|0
"I've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's proper rebirth on DVD. Of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if I had seen in it the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film ""Squirm"" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely Oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just to have them dispatched in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans."|1
My kids loved this movie . we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie . we laughed our asses off.it was a really great movie.we loved it. This is a good family film, you will laugh, cry and most importantly think. It's not just about an average day, it is about a family that is struggling to make their way to the top. It touches on many subjects that we can all relate to such as love, ambition and money. There is something for everyone to relate to. I would recommend it to everyone.|0
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy. This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife.|1
Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her.|1
I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old . I knew nothing about the movie, but I had seen the commercials and I knew what the poster looked like, and I was curious about the plot and what was going to happen to the lead. I never dreamed that this would become one of my all time favorite movies. The movie opens with a shot of the ocean waves rolling in on a sunny beach in the summertime. Then there are a couple of quick cuts, and the movie has moved to New York City.|0
"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn't on so late at night. It's on at 12:30 AM.

I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.I grew up in the 60's.

When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door , I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling . On the one hand, I think, “Oh no, this is a sad film. There’s too much going on in the background. I don’t care that the protagonist of the film is so young.” Then the film turns out to be full of subtlety, which I don’t really mind, as I don’t get to see too much in a short anyway, and so I feel happy.|0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game . This is the number one best TH game in my opinion . I can't believe that I didn't know how to play this game . It's just so simple it's amazing . But it's still a very fun game when played well . That is why this game has had so many releases . This game is for all you TH fans . And for those of you who don't know what TH is . TH is the TH game that you want . And if you never played the TH game that you will want .|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me . I loved Orry and George even though he is a bit annoying in some ways. But the story and the way it was written is very clever and I can see why they have become classics. Even though it was in black and white I still like the movie. I would love to watch it again. I liked the way they used light to set the scene and the way it was filmed. It was very dramatic but still funny . I think that I will watch it again on DVD one day.|0
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial . The films that featured their brood paved the way for television shows and commercials of their ilk. If you were young during the 50’s you probably remember them, if you were older you might not. But for those that did, this post will take you through their history and how they changed movies forever. The characters were based on the 1930’s radio programs of the same name. For those who were young, you might have seen their television appearances.|0
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and , as mysteries should , keep you guessing all the way. Not a whodunnit but a how and where. I recommend this to those who like a mystery but aren't interested in a long book. It is a short read which is good when you have a short time and you want to be on your way to something else. Good story with interesting characters and plot. I really enjoyed the story. I was looking for an exciting read and got one. Thank you for the great read.|0
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield. The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named Brian Foster whose systems at his boss's company seems to keep failing, Brian is also dating the boss's daughter named Casey. But Brian secretly invented a robotic dog named CHOMPS, modeled after his own dog Rascal. But CHOMPS is no ordinarily dog, he is as fast as a cheetah, he has x-ray vision, can leap about 6 feet, and has a strength of 20 men. The new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success.|1
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was alright, the only problem was Moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. Haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. Though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE.|1
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case.|1
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works.|1
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends.|1
"A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a 50's sense (which I love).The look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film ""Far from heaven"" reflects exactly this sort of film (and I suspect this film may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959! ), but as a film-- glorious!"|1
Whoever cast this movie was a genius , every character in it is perfect for their part , and they make the characters come to life better than they ever did before. The only flaw in the whole movie is the ending , there just wasn't enough time for it all to be put into one movie , and the movie could have ended with more of a cliff hanger , making people watch for more , instead of leaving people wondering what happens next , that's why it wasn't as good as the first one.|0
First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria.But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. Al Gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on peoples opinions of the man.|1
I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo.|1
Fantastic documentary. A movie within a movie. I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation.|1
Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all.|1
On watching this film , I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity or any person . So in my search I came across a video clip where I found out that I had missed one of the greatest film directors who died on the 20th of January , 2014 , Mr. Satyajit Ray . Satyajit Ray was the most creative film director of Indian cinema . Not only were his films the most creative , he was also a man with a humanitarian heart . He has left a significant impact on Indian cinema both in terms of direction as well as story-telling .|0
Despite all it 's trappings of style and cinematic invention , this is basically another serial killer thriller , following the footsteps of a dozen similar low-budget British thrillers which have sprung up in recent months. The film , however , is also very well-made , and is no less entertaining than any of its predecessors. The film was made , appropriately enough, for television , on location in Los Angeles , and on a comparatively tight schedule. Although the script was written by British writer Nigel Williams , it was rewritten by a team of writers including the director and the producers .|0
"This movie is Wonderful ! I can watch it again and again . Robin hood is Perfectly cast , and the dialogues are Brilliant . This movie is great entertainment for all ages , and will always make me want to watch it again and again . I would give this movie 8/10 ! I recommend this movie to all Movie Lovers . Go watch it right now and get a new found appreciation for this film . Robin Hood is Wonderful and a must see . Gandalf

Gandalf is the most underrated character in LOTR. I would love to see him get his due in other media, such as comics or TV series."|0
I'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film. If you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. Warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed.|1
With all the dreck out there , this is a gentle movie about young love . Yes , it 's very sweet , but not so saccharine that it 's not worth watching . This is a cute little movie that I 'd love to see on DVD someday . The only down side I see is , it could easily have been much more effective , if there 'd been more music . I did find the music I heard very effective though . It helped to give a little more depth to this story , and that was a good thing .|0
The four signs on the road say `` If You 're Looking For Fun ..... You Do n't Need A Car. '' and I was wondering if you could interpret them for me. Thank you very much, and may all your wishes come true for you and yours. Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you soon. Love and Peace, Mary. An interesting question. All four signs are very clear and can be read easily. The first says if you are trying to find something fun in your life. I would suggest you find a place where you can enjoy yourself.|0
After getting hooked on the mini series , `` North & South , '' I could hardly wait for the book version to come out. And boy am I glad it came out in 2003 instead of in 1998, just like the TV series, to give this book a more solid base. Because the mini series was too short, and the characters were just too fleshed out to make an entire book. In the book version we get more of the character's background, more detail in their lives, and an even more complete story line.|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I had nightmares for a long time after watching this movie, I remember waking up from the nightmare and then my mother would give me a really stern talking to and I knew better than to go back to watching scary movies. I watched the movie a few years later but I didn't watch it again until I watched it a couple weeks ago. I found it was pretty funny and the ending really gave me shivers.|0
I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old , ( having an existing interest in dinosaurs ) and I found it to be a good and entertaining story , ( though the story line is a bit strange ) ,, but it's still a good ride for younger kids , ( though not so much for adults ) . The movie is actually pretty good in the technical aspects ,, the story line , the acting ,,, but the special effects ( like the dinosaurs in the movie ) are just laughable , the story line and acting just doesn't hold up to the actual film .|0
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :D It's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings.|1

The bandits , in the meanwhile , hide in a forest and set up a roadblock . At the roadblock , however , the bandits' leader is killed . After their leader’s death , his followers decide to go back and get the money back . A battle takes place between a group of the bandits , in possession of the leader’s revolver and a group of local militia men .|0
Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made , `` Murder in the Music Hall '' seems to have undeservably suffered from being made at an odd moment in an odd director's life and a moment in an even odder industry. There has never been any good reason to doubt the sincerity of its intentions, but those intentions have not come off with any sort of precision. There has been no coherent story; indeed the film has no story whatsoever except to offer a series of scenes that might conceivably be assembled into something that resembles a story, but only by a most circuitous route .|0
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does n't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with a good cast, fine direction and some excellent location shooting. The Lone Ranger is still around in the early 1950s, having made its first full-length appearance a few years ago, and this time it is based on an old western radio drama which had originally aired in 1931, and a sequel which followed in 1932, both titled “The Lone Ranger: The New Adventures of ‘Tonto, The Lone Ranger and The Tontos”.|0
"Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg - ""Un ballo in maschera"" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that)."|1
"I played Sam ( the porter , Lou 's sidekick ) in the Film `` Dead Rail '' Which later on became a feature movie . But the thing that sticks out the most to my mind are the various things that I had to do , such as :

When I was doing '' Dead Rail '' I remember that they were shooting it in a real railway station . It was a long day , I was shooting for 3 hours . The station was closed , and they told me to be in a particular spot at this certain time which I was , but I didn't really feel like it ."|0
"I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much . This is one of the best I've read . Received for free in exchange for an honest review

I can't find the other review to compare the books but I would like to note that I have watched this movie and the series and it has some really good things going for it , but there are several things I don't agree with. The story is great, the characters are great the acting is great. But for me the one thing that stands out is the ending."|0
Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! In this version,Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!|1
Hands down , the best drama/comedy show on television . A cleverly written show about a young mother and her teenage daughter that explores all aspects of modern living. The writing is sharp and funny , the directing is top notch and the acting is so good , you actually want to laugh at some of the situations . The show can get a little cliched at times , but it's still very entertaining . Highly reccomended to anyone with a good mind , and a funny bone . I just want to thank everyone who voted.|0
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau.|1
I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes . I'm a big fan of the original film and have a lot of respect for Lee, but the first two sequels were awful and the new one was the first one I saw. I saw it on Netflix a few years ago and thought it would be worth watching again but it just didn't do anything for me. They really messed up on the story and the tone was off. I'm hoping this one will be a lot better.|0
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration ( and music ) . I’ve always loved this idea, but have been unable to put it into practice. This month I’ll be doing it with my “D’Anna” opera and will be putting it up online. I’d love to have you take a look. It will be a little while before it is complete. This was a fun project to do, and now I’m thinking I’d like to have a similar project in the future based on my other operas.|0
"Come on . Anyone who does n't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic site they're on. It's like the Simpsons or South Park, the best satire of it's time in history. I don't care how ""old school"" you might think it is, it's so over the top and out there in a way that makes me think that this was done specifically to make people stop and think about the ridiculousness of what we were doing, or to just have some fun. There are no real characters in it."|0
The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values , but very surface story telling and lack of character development are a serious detriment to a work which at its heart should be something much deeper. That said , if you're just looking for an excuse to be entertained this might be worth checking out. If you haven't already , you should know that this film will take place in the midst of the Civil War . This television film is based upon one of the best known songs of all time - The Star-Spangled Banner .|0
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, Land of the Pharaohs"". The sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so ""neat"" in the production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have yet to see the 1999 movie ""The Mummy but am sure I will love it!"|1
15 Park Avenue , well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in London. However, it is actually a building in New York, which is very well known as being a prestigious address. It is also the residence of the President of Columbia University in New York. In fact it is also the home to the University’s film studies department, and the place that where Stanley Kubrick wrote the screenplay for “2001: A Space Odyssey”. The University and its building also have their own website where they keep fans up to date with all the University’s activities.|0
During the War for Southern Independence , GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against marauding rebels. In one of SPANKY's last adventures, he sets out to avenge the massacre of hundreds of innocents. At the outbreak of the war, Confederate General SPANKY and his troops were engaged in the defense of Atlanta from invading forces. One day, his forces were ordered to assist in the defence of Turner's Gap, Georgia, where local civilians were engaged in a pitched battle with marauding Union forces. When SPANKY entered the battle, his troops were ordered to pursue the retreating enemy.|0
Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality.|1
Our America is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the U.S. all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens.|1
When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot.|1
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by Ford favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western ""Wagon Train"" before his untimely death at age 57."|1
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am . My brother and I were channel flipping and landed on it. It is a great action movie with the main focus on action sequences. There are about 2-3 good ones, but it could have been a bit better. I recommend watching it, even to those that might not watch a lot of action movies, this one is a good pick. The last thing I want to talk about for now are two new movies that will be on the DVD/Blu Ray this summer.|0
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect.|1
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.Alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.I've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy.Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor.|1
I'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. All who love this movie should email Disney and increase the demand for it. They'd eventually have to sell it then. I'd buy copies for everybody I know. Everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and I haven't figured out why Disney hasn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. The kids in the new generation don't get to see it and I think they should.|1
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'Alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this.|1
"When I saw the preview for this movie, I figured to myself, ""here's another dumb TV movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera,"" but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Now and Again's Eric Close) but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community."|1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time . We loved it so much . It’s a shame that they stopped making them. I hope you do another series . My favorite series from the 80’s is The Brady Bunch . I wish they would make a series about it . They were the perfect family . Thanks for everything . God bless . The Brady Bunch did a wonderful job at raising wholesome children, but I think there were too many kids. That’s why I enjoy the newer series of the Brady Bunch so much, you only get 3 kids.|0
This film had me spellbound this evening. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted. John Voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane?|1
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. The films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. One obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good.|1
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music.I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.I bought some old movies like "" Melody"" in Hong Kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this."|1
I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock ànd renée zellweger.|1
If this is not my favorite movie of all time , it definitely is in the top five . I saw the film about a month before I graduated from college , and it was not only the last time I saw it ( I still have the ticket stub ), but it was the first time I was able to make sense of what it had to say . I saw the film in a college theater in the summer of 1983. It had not yet been adapted into a musical on stage , and it was the first time I had seen the entire work performed .|0
I was drawn to `` Friends '' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous songstress. The film was a cult favourite and it was clear from the start that the screenplay was written with a lot of affection. So when I read on the credits that the writer/director was a little girl I got excited. She had the potential to turn the whole situation on its head and create something really wonderful. As a writer I wanted to see if she could pull it off. And she did. I hope you enjoy the results as much as I have enjoyed seeing this movie again.|0
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen in years. This movie takes us back in time to another era, a simpler time, but one that we can never return to. The plot is one that has been seen before, and done better. But, as we watch the movie, we begin to realize that what really makes this movie so special, is the acting. This story, though, is not just about two girls and two guys.|0
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short . Every element of the piece assists in eliciting sympathy from the reader for the plight of the victim and it's easy to find yourself rooting for the young protagonist who is an excellent role model for children. There are some nice touches to the writing that make the piece stand out. The Reader is a tale of hope, a story of love and redemption that will leave the reader with a warm and fuzzy feeling of satisfaction at the end and a warm place in your heart for the young protagonist.|0
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen . To explain my experience , let me say this . I have seen most of the movies made by Wes Craven , and for a horror movie to work on a whole , it must meet at least three of four criteria . 1 ) A strong story , and a logical ending. 2 ) The use of fear , and gore , and shock. 3 ) Characters you can root for , and characters whom you don't like . 4 ) An acting performance to give it some life.|0
I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. This is a documentary made by the BBC about one of the world's most remarkable women - Margaret Thatcher. In my opinion, it is the best ever made about one of the great women of British history. The documentary has been made from a large number of interviews with those who knew Margaret Thatcher and who worked closely with her in her public and political career. In many respects, this documentary is a history lesson as well as giving us an insight into Margaret Thatcher's life.|0
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it.|1
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network T.V. I think I was like 9. (Picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remembered,it's really good,scary flick. I think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a ****load of sequels i.e. Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better.|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent , unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters . In the new movie , directed by Peter Segal and produced by NBC , this combination of traits is turned into a high octane thrill ride that is so far above your average TV movie that i can't find the words to accurately describe it . however , i will try to describe it as honestly as i can , since i'm too busy enjoying it myself to worry about whether you get my description or not . . . and , as always , feel free to comment below .|0
This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.The most splendid casting I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top grade in this movie.If you see part 1 you will want to see it all. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.I am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can get children to learn history is great.|1
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. George Sanders is suave and witty. Jonathan Hale simply is Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie.|1
Sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. Splendid villains  you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one  both good and bad. Secondary story lines also are well developed. Several cameos by major stars of past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics.|1
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition.|1
"George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis' campy ""Old Acquaintance"" written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a ""serious"" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition."|1
"I viewed The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' tight script was just what this evening of ""shorts"" needed. It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. The Reader was simple story telling in it's best form, well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted."|1
If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie.|1
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts . This one was leaps and bounds better than the other films I saw the same evening . A very funny film that takes us into the heart of the character's lives . Very funny and clever film that is so true to its source that it could easily be mistaken as a book. The story is based on true events, but as the film goes on it becomes more and more believable until it is just a wonderful comedy of real people, their situations, and their everyday lives.|0
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe , grappa , aramangac or jungle juice someplace when one of them said to the group, "" What the hell kind of movie was that?!?"" ""I mean , this was a big- budget picture, the kind of picture we see all the time, you know. And it was so bad. "" One of those directors then turned to the other, and said , "" It was terrible! It was just so terrible !!!!!"" "" Yeah , it was just terrible , man !"""|0
One of the many backwoods horror 's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. This was a B- movie at best and some of the stuff they use in it was pretty clever. There is some great stuff in it. The first half of it is pretty great. It's a very strange movie that doesn't really know what its is. It's not scary or funny, but it is fun to watch. After the first hour is done and the first big reveal happens you get a pretty good idea what the hell this movie is about.|0
Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can that EVER exist?|1
"Personally, I regard ""The Egyptian"" in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian movie commenter & critic named Bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. This movie fitted the Bill perfectly & I came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it, as I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.To me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production!"|1
I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it . What a movie . I am not going to comment on the movie plot or anything like that , but it was just the right kind of movie for my liking. I like movies that leave a mark in the viewer and this was no exception . The movie is so well done and well crafted . It is like a masterpiece . I don't know what it is all about and I dont think the director knows what he is all about but this is one of the best movies I had seen till date .|0
"Believe it or not , the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once , and was missing for nearly two years

A man named Robert L. ""Bob"" Stinson III has confessed to the crime. Stinson had worked for the Louvre for almost twenty years as a guard. He had access to the painting and the passcode to the lock. On October 31, 1911, while on his lunch break, Stinson, with his girlfriend, the cook Mona Lisa Giroux, decided to steal the Mona Lisa while on a boat ride to the Louvre in Paris."|0
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again ( because I 'd missed it the first time around ). The second thing ( and the biggest surprise for me) was how good the film was. It is as funny, clever, touching as the first time round, and the fact that it is now showing in 3D has only enhanced its charm. What makes it great is how well all the characters are handled, and how each one has such a unique personality which you can easily recognise ( and love ) no matter who played them.|0
"I played Sam (the porter, Lou's sidekick) in the Film ""Dead Rail"" Which later aired as ""Alien Express."" And, I have to say that for my part I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. As a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi(the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) Were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production."|1
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film. It is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a cache of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane.|1
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film . I had just seen the MOOG docu-drama , “Moguls and Movie Stars” . It was quite interesting, if not a tad depressing, but it was a fascinating look into how moguls operated back in the day. The film focused mainly on two moguls, Jack L. Warner and Irving Thalberg. Both of whom had amazing relationships with famous actors and actresses. There were a lot of people involved in the film who worked at the studio, but most of the actors/actresses were left out of this film.|0
"This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and ""man of the house"". It could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really?"|1
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including ` the young & the old. ` It is so funny that this film could happen in 2017. ` It is very entertaining. It is also a must for those who like to laugh but also those who have not seen much of the funny films. It is not the most sophisticated film. It does have a few flaws which are not too noticeable but I can see where the director wanted to go with the film. ` If I have to find fault it is the fact it does not make it all the way over.|0
This one started excellently. The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious.|1
It's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring.|1
For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made. The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film.|1
"I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to willing sex fiend in under two hours I thought “What is the name of this movie?? ?” I had never heard it before and I don't remember seeing it in a video store or anywhere else. So , if anyone can help out with the title and the director of this great flick please post a comment! I think we would all like to read your opinion on this! Thank you very much for your help,

I have no idea but I have found it before."|0
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. Well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. It has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.Hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways.|1
"The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art, Poetry, Philosophy, Magic, etc. However, this essay will approach it as a sort of Science Fiction (SF). I do not know much about SF, but this is what I understand:

SF is a mixture of different elements. I will try to explain some of them here. The idea is to see if I can use the elements of SF to shed some light upon the interpretation of the T.A. 1."|0
I finally received my DVD today , viewed it and I 'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical cut with the extra scenes. Although I have no real comment other than that they have done an admirable job on the DVD version. It looks great , has sound and picture that are both good with the usual minor imperfections . It 's even got a decent commentary which I haven't heard in a long time. In other words I am pretty happy with the DVD and would recommend it for fans of the original theatrical cut.|0
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships , 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the film is more like a play than a film, with actors taking on a number of different roles. In fact, the whole movie is a sort of “living theatre“, with actors switching between various roles.This makes it more than difficult to follow the story, because you have to constantly keep track of what is happening in the story.In fact, the whole story seems to unfold in three different plots, which make it very hard for me to remember what is going on in the story.|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . Okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but it`s still compelling . Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott`s performance as DCI Red Metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . It`d be easy for Stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way .|1
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen is planning on having Cartman to be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff.|1
i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it.|1
"""The Cell"" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, ""a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim"", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing."|1
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield . The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor, Frank, who just got married . One day he discovers that the world was created in 6 days and that it will all fall apart in 7 days if it doesn't stop the earth from freezing. The only thing is he's not sure why it's happening because he has no clue what the purpose of the universe was. So he takes his cat and dog on a road trip to the city where he was born to try and find out what's up.|0
"I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld. When Seinfeld first came out, everyone who was anyone in Hollywood had seen it and everyone who didn't want to admit to having seen it would say something like ""What is that show, Seinfeld?"" Then, when the show ended, everyone that had seen it said ""Oh, it's not nearly as funny as Seinfeld was"" and ""Jerry was kind of a schmuck, no one liked him."""|0
This film was made soon enough after Karen's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children.|1
"The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if I feel like I am in control. So when I first heard the news that a movie about the famous love triangle between the three main characters in ""Glee"" was coming to fruition, I was a little hesitant to watch the trailer. After all, I'd already seen three ""Glee"" episodes and found the first two to be a little lackluster. So I decided to trust in the filmmakers and give ""Love, Simon"" a try."|0
This film blew me away . I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot . After watching The Attica Prison riot , you will learn a lot about this tragic event, and also learn a little something about yourself . In this film , we witness a very human side to the very inhuman events at Attica . The human side , in this case , being the inmates and the guards , are not portrayed as evil but as people making very bad choices . We learn the facts about this event, , the history of the prison , how the riots occurred and the aftermath of these events .|0
Just see it ! It 's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time . See it again if you missed it first time . You 'll see it in a different way , a way which is more meaningful to you , and you 'll recognize the movie in your memory . The basic plot is about an American girl and her family moves from California to France for a better life . But things are not as smooth as she expected and she finds that French life is different from what she expected . The story is really cute and it 's really easy to enjoy the movie .|0
This was on odd film . I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. I did not know there was ever a movie of it before but it's not a bad one. I do not understand what the film is saying or why there is a story behind it but it does have some good acting from the main actors and the special effects are very good indeed. I do not think it would be suitable for older children or young adults. I liked this film a lot.|0
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I had to see this one too. I'm so glad i did . I like the fact that it's different then the other ones that we have seen in this genre . This one had some good laughs . This is not a stand-alone movie. It is a story that can be followed after the other movies. But the story is only about 30% of the movie. So, if you like one of the first four, you will probably enjoy this one.|0
It 's interesting to watch how late 1950 's society is depicted in this film . Men are lecherous , women are manipulative , children are selfish and adults are apathetic . However it 's a very well written script and the acting is well done . An adaptation of the popular book 'The Feminine Mistake ' . The original novel was about a young woman who is seduced by one of her teachers . The film , though , is about a middle aged man , married to an older woman and having a relationship with a much younger , married woman .|0
"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience.It is interesting how the film balances the message that ""one should not generalize"" with the notion that ""for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth"". For example, the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well-known Italian stereotype."|1
`5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like cobber' and generally being the classic underdog.Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics' such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People.In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.Set in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town.|1
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good:The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully.It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined.David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done any better.The Bad:There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old ( I hold a different belief). Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.|1
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time . I believe that if you just googled 'Best British comedy' it would show dads army in the top three , it is a genius sitcom . If you haven't watched it , watch it and see for yourself how brilliant it is , it's brilliant , brilliant , brilliant , brilliant , brilliant... It is not a sitcom about family, it is a family sitcom. If you're referring to Dad's Army then I've already said that it's the best of the British comedy series.|0
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!!|1
I'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. And... wouah! The pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by Jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie Abbyss ? Anyway, it's remarkable. Sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on TV, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. The only downside is the commentary.|1
i love this movie . is it on air anymore ? what can i do to get it on air , i live in florida . i have the movie in VHS and also in Dvds i got it in the mail , i live in Orlando . please help me find this movie for me , thank you . hey guys, i’m looking for an old horror movie that i watched when i was a kid. I’ve only got the VHS and I remember that it was really scary. There was a dark tunnel, and I think someone came out of it.|0
I absolutely fell in love with this girls . let me tell you something : I am from Romania and it is a beautiful thing to get to know some girls from all over the world ! First of all I want to thank to this site for being so nice and for this beautiful girl for giving me such a pleasure . Hi, my name is Marius and I am 17 years old boy living in Bucharest (Romania). It's my first time and I think it will be my last to do this thing, but I didn't want it to go away so fast.|0
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom.|1
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off . It’s 1939, just before the beginning of WW2. The Kettles, along with their daughter and a friend, are on a trans-continental road trip back home to Iowa, when they get involved in a minor accident. They decide to stay in a nearby town and wait for a mechanic to take a look under the hood. There the trio meets the local mayor, whose car had a flat tire. The mayor’s mechanic is black.|0
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately:Nicolas Roeg (dir)--Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.Charles Sturridge--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing.|1
"Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, great lines (""Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat it out on a native drum! "", says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you've seen this movie panned and scanned on TV and not in the letterboxed version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) you haven't really seen it."|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest . In many ways its an extremely entertaining film with a terrific performance from Robert Duvall as the villain . In other ways however the film has some rather glaring weaknesses in its storytelling . But these problems are all part of the charm of this film . It’s quite a fun time . The film begins in present day where an elderly man ( Robert Duvall ) sits in a chair at a nursing home . He has no idea who he is or what his story is .|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.'|1
honestly .. this show warms my heart , i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has begun it all gets more interesting . the new season was great and the new characters that are coming in i hope they are all good or i might lose interest . i hope they bring in some really good stories and i hope that we see some characters die so i can start over and i hope the show is as entertaining and heartwarming as last season . i hope the new show comes on this summer .|0
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""Adam's Rib"" ""Holiday"" Psycho melodramas ""Gaslight"" ""A Double Life"" a great semi western ""Heller in Pink Tights"" not to mention ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Travels with my Aunt"" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera."|1
Just watched Conrack for the first time . Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, I thought it was terrific. The acting was great and the story is very good. It is about a small group of people on a ship who come across a treasure of gold. There's no real conclusion to the story though. It's not about the treasure or what happens when it's gone. It's about the people in the story. The characters are very interesting and well developed in my opinion.|0
"It happens often, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a youth. It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled ""The Egyptian."" Audience were awed with the sets, costumes and great acting of this film, so much so, other films soon followed in like vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions."|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It's not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time!|1
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.This is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. The acting and directing are very powerful.2. Beautifully shot.|1
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic ""Alive"", there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director René Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film ""Supervivientes de los Andes"". The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers."|1
George Cuckor , known as a director of women , could n't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful actresses to play opposite one another in any of the films he directed. They had both won Academy Awards as best actress, and were two of the greatest movie stars of the 1930s -- Jean Harlow and Carole Lombard. In the early morning hours of July 1, 1932, Lombard's house was burglarized. The burglars stole some jewelry and cash but also took several of the most important items of her collection: her passport, her driver's license and her Academy Award.|0
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film,or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future.|1
"this is a really great series . i love the show and i am so glad it is n't canceled. i love all the charactors especially gabrielle who is my idol lol

Ok this show is not the greatest but I must say I love it. And I am not even a fan of this genre. I think that it would be a good idea to let the fans vote to decide whether this show will get canceled. If the fans vote it will get canceled and that is why people are complaining. So it is not fair for the critics and the fans to let the show get canceled."|0
I must say it was a let down. Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, I am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.But the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of English. Its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in India which talks in English even at home, but I am sure its not as formal as in the movie. Moreover, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in English.|1
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film.|1
Forget about Donnie Darko . I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I've read for the movie have focused more on this aspect of the movie than the actual movie. The fact is, as a stand-alone piece of art, Donnie Darko is a pretty bad movie. I don't think anyone can reasonably argue otherwise. But when the film is placed within its cultural context it is an entirely different animal entirely. The cultural context is where Donnie's brilliance lies. Without that context, this film would be a pretty good movie at worst, and at best an over-wrought art film.|0
This was a pretty good episode . Though no `` Trapped in the Closet '' or `` Cartoon Wars , '' this did have a few laughs and had a great premise . This time they were trapped in the bathroom . The setup is pretty cool . A woman is in the bathroom getting a facial when her son walks in and sees her in the mirror . He is so freaked out by the situation he pulls the toilet paper out of the roll and wraps it all around his body so he can be in the other room . Then he pulls the shower curtain down to the bathroom so no one will know .|0
The philosophical , meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind . I 'd give it 10/10 without a doubt . If you didn't see it in the theaters then I can assure you that you will be seeing this on DVD soon. The DVD is coming out on August 9th. This is the kind of film that you should own in your movie library. This film is definitely worth the watch and I'm glad that you have the chance to see it on the big screen as well. This film is rated R and it is for those adults who have an appetite for this kind of film.|0
"Being an avid Carpenter Fan , I really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired !). I'm not a big fan of the Carpenter movies because I think he only has two good ones, "" Halloween "" , and ' The Fog '. However, I think this film has some of the best parts of the Carpenter movies and I'm glad that it's getting a remastered Blu-ray release from Scream Factory on the 23rd of November. My favorite parts of this movie are :1) Laurie's (Scream's) transformation."|0
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product.I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa(?) accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing ""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Trainspotting"" or any other film with heavy-accented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes."|1
"This was a pretty good episode. Though no ""Trapped in the Closet"" or ""Cartoon Wars,"" it had a lot of things going for it. The character of Al Gore and that bizarre-as-hell ""super cereal"" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman/Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake! ), and he comes within inches of his face."|1
In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues making the documentary, discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama.|1
"Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that 's been released lately . It was funny , smart and just all around well worth the watch . It was also a very different type of comedy which I really did not expect to get from a movie . This was the kind of comedy that actually made you laugh as much as I did . I know what you may be thinking at this point in reading my review , ""Sure she thinks it's a movie about nurses but what did she really think it was about ? """|0
I do n't usually like to see movies while they 're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I did this time because the kids wanted to. It is a very popular movie with lots of action and suspense. The film is well done and the kids liked it. This one is definitely one that I 'm sure you 'll want to go see! I really enjoyed this book, and I liked the way the story unfolded. I 've read other books with the same concept but this book was original and the characters were very well written.|0
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about. Or, maybe it isn't: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke. It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. He gets into the form of the world around him entirely, without a story, bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, as his camera (shooting on supposedly discarded film stock) wanders like in a pure travelogue.|1
"This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger)is the lone ""acceptable"" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; ""looker"" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well."|1
In `` Black Snake Moan , '' writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me wanted to just skip the movie all together, just so that the message could finally get through. It's about a white teenager who, after being held captive and brutalized for three months by a serial rapist, kills him in a hail of bullets. When the police come for her, they find that she had a tattoo of a black snake wrapped around a white skull. I didn't understand how a movie with this kind of symbolism could even exist.|0
I have n't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way that I could never forget it. “Black Panther” is such a film. It was released in February of this year and had the largest number of screenings in a theater I have ever experienced. I know I am in the minority in my feelings towards this movie and that it is probably going to be heavily condemned by most people who read these articles. However, I will still explain why it is so incredible. First off, the production values are mind-blowingly impressive.|0
This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert , and its influence on them is obvious. In particular, it has a very strong effect on Road Warrior , which began filming a month after this finished. I've always been fond of this film, but I don't recall much from it that I found particularly memorable, and that may be the case with others as well, though there are some elements that I really like. I'm not even sure if I like it as well as it's predecessor, though there's certainly an influence of it in that film.|0
It happens often , while growing up , a Hollywood movie impresses a youth . It not only lasts a long time , but it also changes his or her life forever . I remember , it was one such movie that changed my life as a child . As I grew up I realized that this movie was not just a nice piece of entertainment . It changed my life in many ways and for many years . It was the movie ‘THE DARK KNIGHT’ directed by Christian Bale . It was this movie that started me on a journey to become a screenwriter .|0
"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. ""Shoot him now!"""|1
I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday ( 4 February , 2006 ) and came away with a different perspective. I did so not as a critic, but as a film goer. What I realised from watching this film in a Singapore cinema yesterday is that this is a film not for the West. This is a film for the East, and specifically Singapore. For the simple fact that it is set in Singapore. If you are from the West , I believe this film has not much to offer you ( unless you live here in Singapore ).|0
`` Two Hands '' is an entertaining , funny story about Australian lowlifes . The screenplay contrasts the world of small town life in New South Wales with the modern world of city life . The plot centers on the actions of a young schoolteacher who finds himself drawn to the life of a gang member . The movie '' Two Hands '' has received mixed reviews from critics in the United States . Many of the people who enjoy the movie in the United States see the movie as a low budget version of the '' Reservoir Dogs '' . But '' Two Hands '' has also been well received in the United States .|0
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the Justin and Madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine, and accurate. The costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. I dearly love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American History, and I love movies about it.|1
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, Young takes his place to carry on the fight for his life. Young also has to save his own life. But in the end, neither man wins, both men lose, and we find that neither man really had it all that wrong. When I was young, I hated the idea of romantic movies. I thought they were too corny. I never thought that they were any more than corny.|0
"This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However the same cannot be told of the gals. In the end too, u see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was ""There was no Taylor"". And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of Ben. Also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben."|1
One of the biggest French success of the year 2002 , `` l'auberge espagnole '' was also very well greeted in Spain , with more than 12 million spectators . The film was very successful at home , and its total box office was around 150 millions of francs . The plot is relatively simple , in a small hotel in the south of France in the early seventies where there is the son of a famous detective ( Philippe Torreton ) . The hotel is run by a couple with a daughter of 21 ( Marie-France Valois ) , and his son ( Pierre Sabatier) .|0
"The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful . I liked the movie . Can anyone suggest any more movies that are similar in this genre? Thank you

I've been a fan of this type of story since I first saw ""The Twilight Zone"" episode about a guy living in the future who meets an old friend and they reminisce of their life in the past. That was in the first year I got a television, around 1959 I think. That's the one I first saw and I have loved that type of story ever since, it's the most fun one."|0
I like movies that show real people `` Americans '' and tell truth . The movie is simple and that is a good thing about it . The characters are real and that is a bad thing about it . When a movie shows real life it makes us think of real life . And this movie does that very thing. In this movie we see people who are afraid of something happening . And that is all we see in the movie . It is about the fear that people have . We see no action in the movie . Just the fear that these people have .|0
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up ""pronoun trouble"" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I've laughed at since I was a kid."|1
"I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see."|1
"The Killing Yard is a great film, although uneven at times. Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's ""flashback"" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. I was not even born when the Attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, I find that ""The Killing Yard"" does the story all of it's fair justices."|1
1981 's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there . It 's one of the most brutal horror films I 've ever seen as well. It is also one of the best examples of how to write a film with an original idea while still telling a decent and well-crafted story. It 's also one of my personal favorites among Stephen King stories. The plot is well-written, well-paced and well-executed, even though it is an original idea and not something already written before by him. The story is about a couple of teenagers that are camping out for the summer in New England.|0
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead!This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the ""ordinary people"" type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespear's ""Midsummer Nights' Dream."" Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable."|1
"Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little, and so I offer my (rather less complimentary) take on 'The Missing'. If you want to know where you stand with this kind of drama, read on...

First things first. When the programme was first announced I thought: ""Oh please, let this be good - it needs to be, after all!"" And it was. The BBC drama, which ran for two series of five episodes each, has become a very good, well-crafted and thoughtfully-made piece of TV."|0
This is a really great film ! It gets you thinking about your parents . How we all have fragile little egos that we protect as much as possible from ourselves and others . It is a hard concept to grasp at times because it takes a huge amount of self-knowledge to get to that place of understanding . It will help you to better understand why some people need so much love and attention from you. It also shows how difficult it is to accept that your parents didn't always want to be the best people for you and still you feel compelled to be the best for them.|0
When I saw the preview for this movie , I figured to myself , `` here 's another dumb TV-movie where the hero is an astronaut and his love interest is another astronaut. ' So , I wasn 't exactly blown away , but I still thought it was worth checking out . The first half hour or so or the movie was a little dull , with a good looking cast and good production values , but , the rest of it was pretty dull too . At first , the hero of this story , an astronaut named Sam (Jason London ) , gets into trouble on a space mission to some distant planet .|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . I think I heard it mentioned in an interview and it stuck with me the whole time . I don't know what the heck that is supposed to mean , but whatever , if it means being more aware of all this shit , then why the fuck wouldn't we be more aware , right ? The thing that makes me feel like an ass is the part where you say , ""Oh , no , not like that , you mean being aware of it 's not a bad thing , just different "" ."|0
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!This short will bring lots of laughs.|1
Absolutely , I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting , fascinating and certainly beautiful film. In terms of what we are doing , we are doing it in part because of this film. This film, in my view, illustrates in a very direct way and in a very simple way, what this group is doing and I would suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the things we have said about this, the things we have said about what has gone on previously , the things we have said about what goes on today is not new and certainly not original.|0
Forget about the plot of this movie . Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn ( I would have liked him to have played it straight, though), or the fact that it is a great thriller . I would like to know what it is about because I have seen this movie at least 50 times now, but I just don't get it . The best I can do is give you my opinion of this movie, and I will do that to make sure that you, the readers of this review, get to see the movie, too, when you read it.|0
First of all , ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans . Everyone is doing that , and it is not really funny. It was made a few months after the 2008 election, so it is an obvious attempt to mock the left , and make it easy to ridicule them . It is also a poor attempt. It's not funny, and you're not being funny. And it doesn't matter, because it's just an attempt . South Park isn't there to mock every single issue , or mock the left .|0
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. I can still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I though wow this looks exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see book one and two on TV in the Netherlands.|1
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dancing, music and choreography! The leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing! May they always keep shining and keep dancing. Their on stage chemistry was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will be. Long Live Riverdance!|1
North and South is a miniseries from the `` golden age '' of television miniseries in the 1980s , which was broadcast on BBC2 in three weekly episodes on Wednesday nights at 7.00 pm in the first half of November 1983 . Based on the events of the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865 , it is set during a year when the Confederate States of America were fighting to keep their independence from a United States in the process of forming, and during which many battles were fought on both sides of the border . Although the miniseries was a success, it was not well received by its audience when it came out.|0
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their ""Erasmus year"" in Barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal location. The idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about the countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries.Having experienced ""Erasmus"" on myself during my exchang semester in Italy I can say that is movie is incredibly authentic."|1
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like ""he's faking"". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody."|1
"Just see it! It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclical. Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding ""plot"" and character"" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity."|1
"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, ""Friends"" goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences."|1
"spoiler--In 1993, African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with ""Posse"". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the main character, Jessie Lee.Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba."|1
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'The Gunfighter' by Henry King, and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. 'The Gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.However, I personally find 'Wagon Master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. Although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring.|1
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw ""capturing the friedmans"" a short while ago and have to admit I thought this was better.The story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war. Block deftly guides the viewer through diaries, family footage and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and probing, and his insights are clear and measured.51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, the social fallout, and potential for redemption."|1
I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, thought it was great. We got to see, Robin always being 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), was enlightening.|1
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn up for the movie. Going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. A great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma's part. Shabana Azmi a divorcée who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister.|1
I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went back many more times to see it over and over ... I think 9 times in all. Just great is how I would describe it ... I was taken by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the life style the kids began on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had set up ... of course the powers that be have to intercede, but when I forget that part I find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that!|1
Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama.|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about . Or , maybe , to have the experience yourself . I have found it can be a very good experience , but I can't say anything to anyone who is new to this . It really is just like a dream and you can choose to go where you want in it . I have found that there are some things that make me happy and some things that make me sad , but overall , it's not like any normal dream you might have . It is just for me .|0
As I was reading through the comments , I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was better than the actual Star Wars . I'm not a Star Trek fan and the first two movies I didn't enjoy all that much but for this movie I liked it better than the original trilogy ( and I don't like the new one much ). It had good action , good story , good acting . I loved the first two Star Wars movies because of the way it told a story. I had no idea how Luke, Leia and Han would be involved in a war.|0
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie. Is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.It shows a different face o Bogotá and I think that's very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world This is the first movie of the director Felipe Martinez and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.We need to continue support Colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.|1
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one . I really ca n't come up with another, but I will keep searching. If you know of any others, let me know in the comment section. I'm not interested in any remakes, just films with a similar feel and atmosphere . I'm not into horror/thriller/comedy/romance/gangster type of movies. I am not into big budget movies with big name stars and big effects. If the budget is low to medium then you can bet I will love it, no matter if it is a remake or not.|0
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris . We 're all here on an exchange program in Paris and so I saw the movie here. It didn't make a lot of sense so we watched it back at our place and then we went out and looked for something else to watch on DVD that we thought would make sense . We bought this movie and that's what we watched it at home. I'm going to talk about the movie. So we're going to talk about the movie . Okay. Let's talk about the film.|0
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow . We do n't usually warm up to a series in a few episodes but we did with these two and were really hooked. It is about a guy named Will Graham ,who is a psychologist who has a relationship with a girl who is having multiple personalities . This is based on the book by a man named Robert D . Harris . The book was called "" Multiple Personalities"" and was published in 1981. It is a good book to read. The show was based on this book and there was a tv series made from the book."|0
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely.I like The Gilmore Girls but I am not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson).|1
"In ""Black Snake Moan,"" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into ""Happy Ending"" territory for my liking)."|1
This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years . As a boy , I spent my summers camping and hiking in the Rocky Mountains in Banff, Alberta . At the time, I had absolutely no idea of what was in store for me when I met and fell in love with my wife . The summer of 1975 was magical and memorable in more ways than one. My wife and I went camping , hiking and canoeing through the Rockies . In the process, we met a few people that changed our lives.|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission , I can only look at this as a good thing. It will help people understand the past and, perhaps, help prevent the re-occurrence in the future. We can't forget the horrors of the past, and we need to learn from them to ensure that the future will be better for all Australians, black and white. It would be great to see an official statement from the government regarding the commission, to ensure that all citizens can celebrate and learn from this important moment for all Australians.|0
This show is really great. It's smart.It's funny.It's great acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The Dialogues are really funny and well acted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.You really do believe they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.|1
Fantastic documentary . A movie within a movie . I 'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother 's Passing . As much as this movie is great and worth seeing (and I do , because it's so inspiring ) , I'm glad I saw the documentary first , because I want to give a more personal review. It 's very inspiring to see and hear these people talk about how they got into the business and how they've overcome all obstacles . I 'm not gonna lie . It was great to see the interviews , but more than the interviews , it was great to actually see this movie .|0
"Surprisingly good made for T.V. Thriller. I wasn't expecting too much from this one but I'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. It's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.The background story of Thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.The ""stranger"" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society."|1
Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I begin ? The years of hard work paid off in what is arguably one of my most favourite pictures I have taken. This shot took over 2 days to compose as there are so many different aspects that can be considered, some obvious, some hidden. I spent a very happy two days in Bali in October 2009, as a guest of the Indonesian Marine Biologist association (IBA) who organised a workshop where I met a few very talented marine photographers who shared their techniques with me.|0
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of ""We've Only Just Begun"" and Karen's marriage troubles admirably (the ""Superstar"" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitar solos, etc. Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter's personality."|1
Brilliant film! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats how it is with post pulp era. Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity!Anyway the film's about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it.|1
I just started watching The Show around July . I found it by mistake , I was channel surfing during a break in work and it was on. There are a lot of other shows I enjoy , but this is one I’m hooked on. There’s not a day that goes by without me turning it on in my car and in my house. Every week it’s something new and fresh. It keeps my mind stimulated and helps me keep my sanity when it’s so hard being a single dad with a full time career.|0
"""Boy Next Door"" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. If you thought all he could do was play ""Bull"" the bailiff on ""Night Court"", think again."|1
"A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western , given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social commentary . 
 "" Unforgiven "" was directed by John Huston and starred Robert Duvall as "" The Man "" and Kevin Costner as Duvall's former law partner . Duvall plays the baddie , a bad old outlaw , who goes back into hiding . However , his past catches up with him and so he returns to town to exact his revenge . 
"" Unforgiven "" has plenty of twists , plenty of guns , plenty of violence and some pretty graphic scenes ."|0
I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic!|1
Recently I saw this movie again ( after 25 years ) . In the original there is a scene in the opening which is quite interesting . It is one of the few movies which I would not miss for anything . I think it might be worth your time to see it at least once if you haven't already . There is also another interesting scene , which has been quoted in a book about the making of the movie , which was written by the director . So I think it would be interesting to read it as well. The following is the story of this movie as I remember it .|0
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie . But at the earnest request from my husband ,I gave in to his pleas and agreed that this movie should be watched atleast once . So I watched this movie on the same day that I watched “Munni Badnaam Hui “. This movie also stars the “Dishoom “ cast members. Well, as per the title of the movie , it is definitely a “Breezy” watch. And it is just that. Now coming to the story . It has a simple story . It tells a simple story .|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie.|1
Yes , this is one of the better done television movies and I would n't expect less from Joe Sargent who has directed some good movies, but I think that this is a better directed than a better written. I think the story was a little contrived and the chemistry between the 3 main characters a little off- putting. This was not a great movie but I enjoyed it. The acting is very good and so is the directing by Joe Sargent. The premise of this movie is fairly simple and it is not very original, but that is not why it works.|0
Jimmy ( Heath Ledger ) is given a simple job by Pando ( Bryan Brown ) a underworld kingpin to go undercover in a rival gang to assassinate a member of his crew, Jimmy reluctantly agrees to carry out the mission. During his time undercover he must decide what his real agenda is and if he will stay loyal to Pando or if he will reveal himself as a mole. I have to be honest I didn't really enjoy this film. There is a very interesting storyline but it's not played well at all and the ending doesn't work at all.|0
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare , but Fata Morgana is a good case . You can chalk up the film’s success to a couple of things: a good script , a decent director , a smart leading actor , and a talented production team. However , the film is also successful in its metaphysical approach. I don’t mean the subject is discussed , as that would be obvious , and I don’t mean it’s a film about life , because that would be a given in a film about reincarnation . What I mean is that the film is really about perception .|0
During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against a Yankee invasion.In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional feature-length films. With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG. Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success.|1
I 'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film . If you think about it a little , it really tells you a lot . We see a man who tries to do something for his country . He also tries to do something for his country's family . He loves his family . He really wants to do for them . All he wants is to be able to make sure his wife and kids are taken care of . It's his right , and we feel for the characters . We don't like him and we don't feel for him at all .|0
This film was made soon enough after Karen 's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen are still getting over it, but the end result is a truly remarkable documentary on an extraordinary woman. It's very hard to find words to convey my reaction to the film, and I'm sure that my own words will fail in some way to do justice to what I feel about this documentary. In fact, I find I don't know how to convey how very much the film means to me. That is, the film means a lot.|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
For my money , probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford has ever made. It is a film I would have loved when I was a kid, and would be sure to watch when I was older. Ford's film is, simply, The Searchers, the 1955 masterpiece from director John Ford that is arguably one of his best, if not his very best, films. I was reminded of this when I went to see the film at the cinema on Friday night and was shocked to see that the film had been re-cut to be more violent.|0
This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ! I was not a comedy fan when I saw this movie back in the 80's , and I ' m not really now. I ' m not that kind of a person that ' s really into the comedy type of movies. However I just recently saw it with my girlfriend who 's a huge comedy fan and she really loved it ! She said the movie is very funny and the comedy scenes are great. I 'm now thinking to get it for my list of funny movie .|0
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot . Bugs of Daffy . He 's unsure of where to shoot . Elmer would have to fire a shot into the crowd . He was afraid that he wouldn ' t even kill one of them . They were all in the same class . He wouldn ' t have any way of knowing which one he was aiming at . He 's afraid it 's going to be difficult to hit any of them with a bullet . He might hit somebody else instead . If he 's lucky , the bullet will pass through all of them .|0
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we 're in a bigger hole than ever . That 's not to say that we won't come out of it, but it 's very, very unlikely. We will be there, I'm sure, in a year or two. And the worst part of that is, it looks as if we may have to have another war with Iran in a few years, and we will have to keep going in Iraq as we go in Afghanistan, because we are in such a deep hole there that we cannot pull ourselves out.|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish movie on cinema! Therefor, I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of thrill and humour is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea.|1
"I finally received my DVD today, viewed it and I'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of ""Rich and Famous"" that the edited for TV version of the film that somehow made it onto VHS sometime in the late 90's but, now WB has corrected the error and released it on DVD complete with the airplane restroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the Hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C**t!"|1
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . And the reason for being more aware of things is because of this Blue energy that has come through you, from you and into you. It is that you can be aware more, more consciously, more purposefully, more deliberately and more with intent. Because that is all that the Blue energy has. The Blue energy is all of those things. The Blue energy is awareness. It is being aware that you are being aware of what is being done in this world.|0
Awww, I love this! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon doesn't really need an synopsis, as that's what it is... the cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. It's the artistry that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year (2005)... yeah, almost same thing, which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off.But this is a really good short, with stark black & white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction...|1
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford 's best in my opinion . No major stars , not even Jane Greer or Maureen O ' Hagan , but a good solid western with a few great moments . This has a lot of the old Ford feel to it which I like . This story takes place in the mid 1800's . The film opens with a young woman being whipped by a group of Native Americans in the middle of nowhere . We don ' t know how old she is , maybe 14 , maybe older , but her face has the look of an innocent young girl .|0
As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50 's , along with the other 3 items in my egypt collection, it is all the more reason to have all this in one package. The item itself is in great condition for a vintage piece , and I have never had a single problem with anything I have owned to this day. A must have piece for any collection. I am the owner of the piece and can personally verify that this is 100% AUTHENTIC and comes from the same original owner as all my other egypt collection.|0
"After ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type."|1
(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home.|1
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. The thing is South Park makes fun of everybody, much like the Simpsons did. If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious, Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing.|1
`` The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends , '' says Marion Fairlie , who with her sister , Mabel , has just arrived at her sister's new house in London . When her sister dies suddenly , Marion learns that the new house , which cost her sister her health , was built on the site of an ancient , forgotten pagan temple , and as soon as she arrives at this house , there are weird and mysterious occurrences which start to take place . It is no wonder she begins to have strange and inexplicable dream , for this is the time when her soul has to take leave of her .|0
What can you possibly say ? This is the uncut hardcore , musical Alice ! It works too with a story about a girl in her room , and a guy coming to her door. She doesn't know him , and he's in the mood to fuck. So she opens the door. The next thing you know, she is on all fours , her ass sticking out . She wants to please her man , and she knows that she'll need to work on her technique . So , she tries it on her first , and she gets to work on his cock .|0
"then you will be a big fan of this movie . Its almost the same basic concept , a nice looking film but the main issue is , there is no sex , no nothing , so why watch this at all

I watched this movie with the hope that it might be good or even great. It didn't happen. It is an OK movie, but you can tell that the director had zero talent. I'm surprised it was made at all, I'm not surprised it was made on such a small budget. Don't get me started on the casting."|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to interact with people of other groups. I was particularly fascinated to see that the EU had made a decision to adopt a name that was not only easy to spell and pronounce for an audience that wasn't fluent in Latin, but it was also a nice homage to the name used for the organisation prior to the formation of the European Community (EC). I didn't see this one at first but it really is interesting and I'm so glad I did eventually see this!|0
This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe . Notice how some of the Roman sets have been used in the recent X-Men. The production cost of this one was over $100 million. This is one of the few movies where the villain is clearly identifiable. It's the villain, and I can't remember her name... I'm not sure what's more interesting: that this film exists, and that it took this long to finally see it onscreen, or the realization that there are some things about this movie that make it, in hindsight, one of the best.|0
First of all - I 'm not one to go all sappy over movies . I saw Friends in the City, and that was my last film. I liked it very much, but the first time I saw it on video, I didn't even bother to go back to watch it again because I didn't feel like I would get a good laugh from the film. Then my wife told me that I was missing out on some great laughs and I gave it a second chance - and I was hooked!|0
I 'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5 , but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5.4 that this review scored. The acting was decent, as was the animation, and the movie had a decent plot. I'm not sure that this movie was a good movie though. Maybe it was just me and my expectations. I'll definitely see it again, as it is one of the few anime I've seen in theaters and I'd like to have more. This was also a good anime to start with. I'm going to have to go with 4.5/5 for this movie.|0
Our America is multi-cultural , with so many sub-cultures . This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time of a culture , a culture with a rich history . In many ways , they are a nation apart , with values and traditions , a language of its own . The movie deals with an inter racial marriage , with two white men marrying a black woman . In the beginning , it is almost like a love story , with the black woman as the object . But the story takes an interesting turn when the couple start having their first born son .|0
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well.All too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre.|1
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome ; more bloodshed and very graphic details ( a bit too much ) but this is still a very enjoyable read/watch. The best thing is that I've only read it and never seen the movie. It's definitely a creepy read. I found the beginning to be really tedious, but after a few chapters it gets a lot more action packed. I also found it really hard to read, the sentences are really short and hard to understand. It just really bothered me that the writing is so choppy.|0
In Mississippi , the former blues man Lazarus ( Samuel L. Jackson ) is in crisis , missing his wife , his mother and his daughter. In the middle of the night at the funeral of Lazarus's wife , who has been kidnapped , he has a vision that leads him to rescue her. After this rescue , Lazarus finds a new family with the help of his daughter . It is then that he discovers that his father has a secret that will shake the whole community . The film was written and directed by John Singleton , and stars Samuel L. Jackson , Vivica A.|0
"After I 've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie, but I'll do my best...I guess you can consider me a jaded film critic now! I'm going to compare it to two other movies of the 90s that are on my Top 10 list of all time; ""Back to the Future"", and ""The Matrix"". I'm just going to list what I saw that they have in common and the things they don't have in common. Let me know what you think."|0
"The first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we actually enjoyed it very much, although we were left wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one, leaving us guessing...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its original integral version."|1
"I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie ""Mighty Joe Young."" What attracted me to ""Wagon Master"" were the great songs sung by the ""Sons of the Pioneers."" Merian C. Cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong."|1
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002, ""l'auberge espagnole"" was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. This movie made by one of the most interesting French film-makers of these last years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students coming from all over Europe and gathered all together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life: either untidy, either serious or with a sense of humor."|1
Hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both.|1
'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality.|1
Obsessed ! ! ! ! ! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love them is because Rory is so adorable. If you are obsessed with GILMORE GIRLZ, you have to start at the beginning! The first episode of this show is amazing and I love Rory’s first season! I really liked the whole idea of the show being about Rory and not Lorelai and I always felt that this show was about the relationship between Rory and her father. Even if the show was not about them, I still would have watched.|0
"Awww , I love this ! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon does n't really need an synopsis, but here is a little something to give a taste of it , and to tell you what it 's like :

The Tale of the Cat and the Moon is an old tale that was handed down from ancient times. In this story, a little cat is wandering around looking for her mom, who had left her. This little cat gets lost and is then found by the Moon who tells her to look through a window."|0
`` Side Show '' is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures . Very gory and full of gore . The story is about a killer in a mental hospital who tries to find a way to get out . The problem is he is very dangerous and if he is able to find a way to escape he will cause mayhem . This one is really bad but also really funny . If you have seen all the other Full Moon films you know what I am talking about . It is all the blood ,gore , nudity and sex you will see .|0
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer ( exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle ) being interviewed by a reporter from a newspaper. At the end he says, 'I don't care who's president, we're still going to do business. We're going to make a play for the theatre. But this time, on the front page, there will be an advertisement.' In the next scene we see the same old producer and reporter in a room filled with a collection of other theater types; they're having a meeting to talk about plans for the theater.|0
"Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a God. I have seen some great work by Aparnaji and i believe he is a great teacher. But what i find is some people are trying to prove there are no Gods. And i really do not know why, i really do not understand it. Can anyone explain me?

`` Jaded '' should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure, but to satisfy the perverts, and they're not even very good. The movie is a total piece of shit that I couldn't even finish. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I'm fairly sure I was the only one to like the whole thing. If you've seen it and think that it's worth a watch, well, you're a better person than the rest of us who saw this film.|0
This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be... well, kind of terrible. A lot of the jokes were pretty good, but not the jokes I was expecting to hear. Oh, they're good. They're even good jokes. Just the ones they were going for, and a few more. This is also the story of a guy who has never seen a live show. So this will be the first live show he's seen in his life. The second one will be on YouTube.|0
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults.|1
Susie Q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the cliché cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was I wrong. It made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. I loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!!|1
What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough.|1
In Crystal City , a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis ( Ben Johnson ) and Sandy ( Kate Bosworth ) as a way to get money for the Mormon temple they are restoring. The Mormons are a close-knit group, and the Temple is special to them because one of their ancestors was a pioneer Mormon. The Temple is on the National Park, which is closed to visitors while the Mormons are working on the Temple. There is no one there during the workday when they are on site and the Mormon workers sleep in trailers while they work.|0
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script , good camera work and transitions , good directing, acting, and direction and sound, but there's a couple of points where I'm not totally convinced by them, such as in the fight at the end. Overall though it's a well-done film. I think you're a little harsh on Saint Seiya. I found it to be very well made (and a lot of fun), and while it didn't have the grand scope of the first series, it did a really good job of bringing that series to the screen.|0
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south . The story follows 2 characters , Black and moan . And they are really in love , they are really into each other , but there is a problem between their family and their love . Moan doesn’t want to hurt his father . Black has to make a choice . And he must choose . Black choose to stay with the girl he loves and leave his family and live away . That is the end of his story . Then a new story begins with a young girl .|0
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator.|1
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. The musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it throughly!! I was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and was blown away. I have not missed a show since power windows and I have to say that they are better than ever.|1
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work.|1
The Killing Yard is a great film , although uneven at times . Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort and does a good job as a crack-shot police detective . But he can't seem to keep it together . One of the more impressive efforts I've seen in recent years . The story is based on a novel by Elmore Leonard . He wrote the screenplay as well and also directed . I liked it a lot . I'm sure you will too . A few years ago I bought the paperback edition of the novel . And now you can find it at your neighborhood library .|0
I had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, July of 2007. I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life.|1
When this show first came on the air , I saw it once or twice and thought it was another example of why so many of us, including my wife , are so fed up with reality shows that it's almost impossible for me to watch them. I knew I'd have to watch it more often because my wife and I have been talking about getting into reality TV ever since I started doing this site. We'd be great for it. I also knew that I had to be very critical of this show if I wanted to keep my sanity.|0
Pat Conroy 's autobiographical book `` The Water Is Wide '' proves to be something of a Southern `` Up North '' book. The setting is in the small town of Pembroke, South Carolina. In his last book Conroy, who is also a native of that state, tells of his early days in life. Conroy, who was an officer in the Air Force, describes how his family moved to the tiny town where his father had been raised. There the Conroy family took up life in the small rural town where all of them lived together in an old frame house.|0
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. I still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. Like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. The best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change.|1
America 's next top model is a good show , it helps people with their careers , but lately i have been noticing that people who are good models are also good actresses . They can do both things, and in my case i want to do acting . I am a girl and i like to act , my boyfriend (now ex-boyfriend) is an actor , the thing is , he doesn't make as much money as he could make by acting , but i don't know why i can't get a real job like him , and i don't know how he makes money doing acting .|0
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie . My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holiday break and even though I am sure they had the same reaction I did I can see why a lot of people would enjoy it . I was impressed by some of the actors and actresses and they were able to bring their characters to life . I am sure that this film would be fun for all ages and for the young at heart it has some of the best lines. This movie really did not give me much to say, I watched it and I didn't really think it was that good.|0
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances . I just read a user comment concerning the sound quality . I don't know what kind of headphones the reviewer has or if that is why he said that . In any case , it is not like the sound is not there . The soundtrack is very well-recorded . I do not believe it is the quality of the headphones that could have caused the comment , especially in that it seems that the person who wrote it had not read the review and had just seen the pictures .|0
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord!|1
I saw it in Europe-plex . Great movie ! ! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the soul , the physical and non physical realms . It is also an investigation of the many faces of the Divine , the many ways in which humans experience the Divine and the many different levels of being and consciousness . This is a very spiritual journey . Not just for the spiritually inclined . It is a film that will appeal to all , regardless of their spirituality , because it takes on all of them in its exploration of life , humanity , and the soul .|0
This is how I interpreted the movie : First things first . There was not a single scene in the movie which I did not love . Second thing is that all the actors were giving their best to make their role the most believable as possible . That was the most impressive part of the whole movie . Now coming to the technical side of the movie . I am gonna talk about it briefly . There are not so much things which one could not like about the whole movie . It was very well made with the best camera angles and shots .|0
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin . There are n't much left when the train leaves, but the train is full of people. A woman sits on a bench and thinks to herself. “What is so important that they travel to Berlin now” she says. “We have a very nice country, it has plenty of jobs, people are happy. The world has changed for the worst during the last war, but here everything has got even better.” A man sits near the woman, not paying any attention to her.|0
I ca n't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten . To be honest , I saw it on opening weekend . I liked it but I didn't like it to much . If I had the money I would have bought it but I didn't . It just wasn't what I wanted . It was kinda like an action film that has nothing to do with action . The action was good . It just wasn't enough to be a action film . There were some good actors in it . I can't see them in much else .|0
THE CELL ( 2000 ) Rating : 8/10The Cell , like Antz , must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time , you'll laugh at all the unintentional humor that makes up most of this film . The second time , you'll understand that director Michael Bay didn't try to take any unnecessary risks , and that you're more likely to get a better grasp on his style of making a movie after watching the first time. If you just want to watch a mindless action film , you can do a lot better than this .|0
`` The Honkers '' is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time . When we were shooting , everyone in the set, except me , knew what was gonna happen to Slim Pickens. The only thing I was thinking of was if this could be any better than it was . I think it is . We were on location and we were filming this scene where Slim was being thrown outta his airplane . Slim's in a bad mood, so he just takes it out on everybody . So this was the scene .|0
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of Ford's 'stock company', including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond,and Harry Carey, Jr.Like almost all of Ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of Indians than in most of Ford's movies. Ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American Democracy.|1
`` Please , do n't kill me ! I 'm just an actor ! '' `` Can you play dead ? `` `` Why are you looking for me ? `` `` You must be a genius , '' You must be a genius , You 're the man !

My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released . The controversy that surrounded the original release made us wonder why this film had any relevance to us at all . I would say that it's because I have seen the same kind of situation take place in my neighborhood. My neighborhood is in the heart of an industrial city. There is an abandoned factory right down the road from my house . There are several homes in the neighborhood that were used to house people who worked in the factory before it was abandoned years ago . My girlfriend is one of these people .|0
"I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest has recently been rekindled by visiting Hilton Head - the next island over from ""Yamacraw"" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent ""The Water is Wide"". With the benefit of knowledge I have reappraised Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. Three things still strike me about this tale: 1."|1

I really enjoyed the story line and it was beautiful to watch. It was interesting to see the difference in the way people react to different things. I really felt for the mother and daughter. The acting is great and I thought the characters were well written and believable."|0
I have watched this show from the beginning , and I am a 45 year old man . To me , this was the show I grew up on . I watched every episode religiously . My father had a friend ( who worked for a tv show ) who was the executive producer . I wanted to be the next guy to get a job like his . And , I remember asking him for a bunch of money ( that he had left me ) to buy some tapes that I would be able to watch when I grew up .|0
With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing.|1
` 5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters , but this film is not about any of that, this film is about three brothers who live in the Outback in the most remote part of Australia , they live a life of crime in the remote parts of Australia , the three brothers are on a run for their lives . now there is a twist, they are on a run to save their life , as well as a little girl , they are on this run because their uncle has given the brothers a small amount of cash to start their own business .|0
This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of `` Rawhide '' Charles Marquis Warren . In `` The Man with No Name , '' a gunfighter and former army sergeant named Tom Blake ( Richard Boone ) has been hired to find the killers of his former commanding officer ( William Talman of ``Dakota Jim'' fame). But once Tom finds out he has been sent to find not only the killer but the men who hired the killer to kill his former commander, Tom finds himself on an emotional roller coaster of self-revelation and self-hatred that will keep you turning pages long into the night .|0
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.The plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good guy?I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it.|1
A classic late 50 's film . The superannuated headliners ( Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan ) are not at their best as they try to recreate their past glories of the 40's . However they are helped by a talented supporting cast who all seem to be relishing the old songs and dances . It's a film I haven't seen in years , but the film is still enjoyable in spite of itself . This was my second movie on the list. The first one was The Big Knife, which is the best movie you never saw.|0
"""Side Show"" is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer makes it out to be (The Trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). Also, the acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.8 out of 10Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks."|1

Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off I went to discover more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy.|1
SPOILERS AHEAD------------------------- Mel has got it going on. From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie.|1
"When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""fat guy, skinny wife"" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just ""okay"" upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud."|1
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch . She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of a detective's wife . The movie is not as good as i expected but it still is worth a rental if you are interested in Raquel Welch. The movie was directed by Arthur Penn , the same director who gave us Bonnie and Clyde . The only reason I bought this movie, is because of Welch . The rest is not much to talk about. The story line is average. If you are a Raquel Welch fan , you will love this film .|0
"I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . They're both amazing films . But what if we take that premise and put it on a horse ? That's what I'm talking about ! This movie is like the ultimate western . Sure it has the "" traditional "" elements that make the western , such as the law and justice . The "" law and justice "" though doesn't seem to be the same as the law in the west . The law seems to be a little more open , or a little more flexible ."|0
Although dated , this film is definitely worth a watch . I saw it about eight times as a teenager and still can't quite get it out of my head ! This is what happens when your dad is the director , but your mother and brother are also cast in the movie . I would like to point out that this movie was made in 1989 , and the director's dad had just died a few days earlier . In this movie you see how the family of a rich and powerful man , live an average life .|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch all the great jokes. It's a story about two girls who are best friends, but one is a lesbian and the other is a lesbian. They have sex together for the first time, after which they both become lesbians. So, they decide to get each other into a straight-only relationship, which of course they do, but then they discover they don't like this, so they switch back to lesbians, and then they have their own lesbian baby.|0
I 've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it is available for rental and purchase on demand. It was a very interesting film to say the least because it takes place during and in part, is based on the true story of a serial killer named Ed Gein. The movie starts with a young girl named Karen being brutally murdered in her bed by an unknown person while she is asleep. She has her throat slit and her body is mutilated, her face sliced off her head and she was sexually assaulted by the man.|0
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes ( with the exception of the season finale and the World Cup matches ) it is the first I've heard of this episode so it will be my first post of this season. I watched the World Cup matches just in case I forgot anything that happened and I thought I'd do the same for the episodes as well so I could share my experience of each episode. Episode: 1

Synopsis:

The World Cup has ended with the US being the victor after a hard fought match against Germany."|0
In dramatising Wilde 's novel , John Osborne has condensed events , eliminated a number of characters , and generally reduced it to a more easily assimilable level , thus making it much more acceptable to the public . it is as if he is saying , look , this is not a great work , so don't bother with it . but this is not what i am trying to do . wilde is an important and interesting book . i know that . i am just trying to convey how it was to read it in the early eighties .|0
Surprisingly good made for T.V . Thriller . I was n't expecting too much from this one but I 'm pleased with the outcome. The story moves at a good pace and the twists and turns keep you guessing what is going to happen next. There is also a good balance between the drama and humour. A lot of humour is included as the story unfolds, which is something that you would never expect from a thriller, but I 'm sure it will appeal to younger audiences as well as the older ones. Overall I would give it a 10/10 .|0
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago.|1
Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic `` Alive '' , there was a man whose talent for capturing images with a camera had already established his status as the leading visual artist of the modern era. It took the form of a book, and was published, not surprisingly, by one of the greatest publishing houses of all time, Harper and Brothers, the house founded in 1820 by publisher and politician Horace Greeley. The book is `` American Scenery '' and it is still in print.|0
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . But I would love to add to this list, and I 'd like to hear what everybody else thinks. I don't have any westerns in mind specifically , but rather westerns in general - the genre of movies. In fact , as I remember it , the first western I ever saw was either Shane or Red River . I 've seen both of them many times , and they are always enjoyable. My favorite western star is probably John Wayne - he was the epitome of the western hero.|0
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.We will enjoy the movie again!|1
At first I could n't tell if it was an art film or a documentary . The day after I saw this film, I went back and looked at some other movies in order to compare it with. I was surprised to find it was the same film that I saw the day before! I have never heard of it before and it is now in my top 10 films! I am glad I decided to look again. It is the best I have ever seen! I am glad I have this film in my life! This film is the best!|0
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD. Yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian, culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh?|1
I 'm certain that people from USA do n't know anything about the rest of the world , but I can assure you that I don' t care about it . I live there , I go to the supermarket , I go to my doctors , I go to work . I do what I need to , how I want . The only problem I have , if you are from USA , is when I tell people from your country that I live in Canada . They start telling me about their problems . But I have to stop them .|0
"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it 's rabbit season . But Daffy doesn't want to eat the rabbit, he just want to catch 'em! Daffy the Duck

In one episode, Daffy gets a job delivering mail to a farm. He sees a bunny and assumes it is a raccoon and shoots at it.

This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways . It is a non stop plethora of emotion and ideas , from love, hate, death, politics , war, revolution and even the most simple things , like the taste of a certain kind of candy . The movie is about a man , his girlfriend , and his country . At the start we find out that a young man has been given the task to kill his girlfriend . This man was in love with the girl but he was too scared to do anything to her . We are then transported to a small island , the country .|0
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera.|1
I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend . It was a fun romp with some cool moments and one or two bad jokes but the whole thing is done well and it’s pretty great . The story of a boy who loses his mother at a young age and then falls into the company of a gang of bikers , one of whom takes a shine to his sister ( who also likes the boy) and he eventually gets in touch with his father . This is definitely not the typical family comedy film and the whole thing makes a lot of sense and the characters are well drawn .|0
Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the stock company out into the Utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are being shown the exit.|1
there 's only so much that i can take of Filipino films , especially nowadays where the trend is sexploitation and kiddie flicks. and even a film like The Unkown, it's just a bad bad movie. oh well.. i 'm still enjoying watching all the action films here , such as Gintama and Danshi Otoko. i love Gintama! i never saw such crazy, funny, stupid, and action filled series before. It was funny how they were saying how this movie will be like Gintama and Gintama 2 when it actually has nothing to do with it whatsoever.|0
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore . I 'm sure it pisses a few liberals off . But to me , this is one of the funniest episodes of the show and I 'm so happy we get to re-cap this! I think it was so funny because it makes fun of the whole Climate Change Movement . They are always going on and on about it , but they don't understand what science is , or even if there is really Climate Change , and they even have their own agenda to try and make their own Global Warming , which as we all know they have failed miserably at!|0
I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with `` Valley of the Kings . '' These movies are in black and white with the first in color and the second in sepia , but I never saw them that way at the time. I also don't remember much else about them except that they were in black and white with a narrator in the first one and a narrator and a chorus in the second. The movie that comes to mind was the one with Robert Taylor, a movie I had seen on TV not too long before that, and then this one came to me.|0
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance.|1
Wagon Master ( 1950 ) Dir : John Ford Production : Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings together four of his most revered western heroes in one of his most ambitious and personal films. The story centers on an old lawman, who has lost his job to a young officer, who has lost his heart to a beautiful young woman. Together, they try to recapture a lost dream of their youth, which involves them going in search of an old lawman's gold, hidden by him when he was a young lawman in the Old West.|0
After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant reference to the 'new world' which is in the film. What a stupid idea! Why should we be told we have to change? That's not what makes the 'new world'. I am reminded of a passage in H.G. Wells 'The Time Machine' (which incidentally is a great book to read if you are interested in this kind of thing). In the middle of the story the time traveler gets to the year 802,701.|0
Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations.|1
I love this film ( dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish , meaningless name!) I think it is far too easy for the viewer to see through the ruse. What I really loved about this film is that there are no coincidences and things just happen for the characters. I found the film very moving. I had not realized that the actor playing the mother was pregnant and gave birth while filming. I found it so moving that she had had to give up the film, and had to leave her newborn daughter behind too.|0
Having just watched this with my mother ( Who got it for Christmas ) i was thrilled to find something that I can use too. So this was the first time I was using this and I was really happy with the product. It gave my skin such a nice glow. My mom also said that it was easy to use. I was really impressed with this product! It is not too much, and not too little. It gave my skin a really nice and bright glow. This is the perfect size for your hands!|0
Surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though I don't agree with the notion that when you do Erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe.

* * SPOILERS AHEAD * * It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a huge letdown. In fact it is a very very bad movie. For a film where the trailer is so great to watch, the movie does nothing to justify that trailer.The movie starts with a good set up. There is a small group of kids in a school and there are rumours that there are mutants among them. They are sent out by the teacher to investigate the story. This is followed by a good action scene. However this action scene is ruined by poor scripting.|0
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.The first time I saw this, I cried from laughing so hard. Everything about it is funny.While ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by ""Real Genius""), it ranks way up there in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over Cary Elwes."|1
In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons , Elmer Fudd is out hunting , and Daffy tries to avoid the bullets , but it seems that the bullets cannot be avoided , so the bullet goes right through his head. It is a common thing for Daffy Duck to not want to do something, but Elmer Fudd always knows what to do . Daffy just can't do it . Elmer is usually the one to do everything, as Daffy doesn't do it himself and he is usually too lazy to try . In one of the Bugs Bunny-Roadrunner cartoons , Elmer Fudd was chasing after Roadrunner .|0
There are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently.|1
Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his RN ex-fiancée. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk.|1
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. It really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the Aussie humor. They portray it very well and very realistically.|1
Do n't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you ? I don’t know why but when you mention the name Disney, everyone always thinks of the 90s and the good old days, which is quite ridiculous, but it’s true. It’s not even the 90s anymore, it’s the 2020s and they’re not doing what they did when they ruled the box office and every kid in the world wanted to see Disney movies, and I miss it a lot.|0
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, ""Rabbit Seasoning"" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqué for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did."|1
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overall view. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short. But, having said that, watching Colin Dunne is nevertheless gratifying. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, changes from the original Dublin production are evident. ""Trading Taps"" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion."|1
`` Americans Next Top Model '' is the best reality show ! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time . This is a great show and I love the girls , but I don't have time for all the bs that happens around the girls on a regular basis . If you want the drama , look elsewhere . Here's to the next season and keep it coming , I love this show and I love the cast ! WELCOME TO THE BIG TIME - THE ULTIMATE SHOW . WE'RE GROWING FAST AND THE BIGGEST THINGS ARE COMING TOGETHER .|0
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film . To have it unfold like a kaleidoscope in one’s mind, so the viewer can play out various plotlines and imagine how things could unfold in any of a variety of possible ways. As a young adult, one of my most favorite ways of enjoying a movie was by imagining that I was the lead character, and watching the film as though I were watching myself. For me, the film could have a completely different outcome than what my imagination was projecting.|0
`` The Cell '' is an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a great film maker , but also his great cinematic artistry . the Cell was nominated for eight academy awards , and won five , including best picture , and it also garnered two golden globes ( best screenplay and best director ) . and even though the film won more than it should have , the real triumph of the film is not in any of those awards . it's in creating an atmosphere that is unlike any other movie . there are no words for the experience of watching the Cell .|0
"I 'll be brief : I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that I like. It is the kind of story where you want to see more and more as it unfolds, where you want to learn more about these characters and their relationship to each other. For me to be able to talk about it is a real honor, so I 'll be brief ...

What I like most is how well this film is shot - the cinematographer seems to have a very keen eye when it comes to making a good looking scene."|0
Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / did n't understand this wonderful film . What a sad life he must lead ! In the UK, where this film is still in circulation, it can only be found as a cheap 'B' print, on video tape . There is no way you could have seen this film in its original theatrical run on the big screen , when it was first released, which is a tragic oversight. The film was shot in glorious Technicolor , and in full TechniScope , one of only three films of its kind made before colour television was introduced to British cinemas in the 50's .|0
Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster ( a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV 's `` Land of the Lost `` ) creates a futuristic home to sell on the Internet. But he needs money so he can afford to build it, and so he gets an advance on a huge commission from a real estate agent to make the sales. Soon he is trying to juggle building a home and selling it. As he struggles to decide if he wants to build his dream home, he begins to feel an increasing sense of dread and foreboding about the future as he watches television with his son.|0
I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly love, The Big Gundown (1970), which starred Dean Stockwell, Robert Conrad, James Coburn and William Smith, as I noted in my review back in September. I had originally gotten this on a video I had shot back on April 7th, 2010, but had only recently gotten around to watching it. Well, it’s finally over, and it’s as good as I remember it being.|0
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world. These three characters are introduced to us when they first appear at a college lecture where an author who is a relative of theirs speaks about his work. As the lecture goes on, we see that this woman, a secretary in a local office, is reading his novel, which is about three women who live together. Her friend, a schoolteacher who has just returned from Italy, is also at the college and she is also reading the book.|0
"Very good ""Precoder"" starring Dick Barthelmess, which in a way, kind of reminded me of Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterful William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture ""Wings"".Barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues."|1
"I could n't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character . I laughed for days just imagining it. In case you haven't watched it yet , Adult Swim recently aired a new TV show called Tim and Eric's Bedtime Stories , a collection of short parodies , one of them being Tim and Eric's Bedtime Story. This is the scene that got me laughing. The scene where Eric and his mom go into the bathroom and he sees a penis on the bath tub and says, ""This penis doesn't want to talk to you."""|0
The philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. I'd give it 10 stars for that alone. That being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what I take, possibly incorrectly, to be its Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated Munsell Color Model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself.|1
I lack cable-vision and no longer have `` DirecTV '' . So being a rural resident I have to wait a couple of hours for a satellite service to show up over the house. And when it does, and I order a movie or a program I want to view, the selection runs to about 30 programs. There are many times when I've wished that there was a local cable provider, or one with better programming. It is very frustrating to have all your favorite programs off the air.I'm thinking about starting my own business with a satellite receiver.|0
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes.|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What's happening in South Africa should guide us all.|1
The first time I saw `` Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy '' , was in the early 1980's. The movie is rated R for nudity and graphic sexual references. I was a bit shocked, but it was my first exposure to a movie like that. I was intrigued. I watched it many, many times. I watched it as a young child, and I watched it again in my adult years. The original cast was great, but the movie was a complete flop with the public. It only ran two months.|0
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son  Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson, his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.|1
Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin? The years of hard work paid off in what is, without question, one of the best documentaries ever created.The sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, are rare and haven't even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know'.Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode.|1
"Michelle, Anicée Alvina, was so nice, and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The ""seasons reprise"" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... Please, if you know where i could find a VHS of the film, mail me!! My husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out."|1
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song."|1
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west. John Ford's stock of character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent James Arness, a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train.|1
Graphics is far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to Underground. It deserves strong love. It is an insane game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even though graphics suck, thats doesn't make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES?|1
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.Many films from the Golden Age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. They date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. Who nowadays asks for a highball? Or wears a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. Frankly, much of value is missing from those days.In any case, go with it and enjoy.|1
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story, Like someone you might have known. Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. Then Life's little temptations creep in, the spoiler, stumbled again. How much, can your love take, and give, to the guy who's really not so bad, after all, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. Played the drums in the bar shots, with the band, did several walking shots, my green 66' corvette was in the motel party shots.|1
A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the Elton John music. I remember seeing in in the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, I confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush.|1
I'm not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. She's a loyal friend and always the peace maker.|1
"comeundone , I love you ! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this whole matter. I am truly thankful for your blog and what you have shared , and wish you all the best . Thanks for sharing this wonderful information and do keep writing,

Your article is really very informative and very useful for me, I have read many article on this topic but this is the most reliable article to improve my knowledge on this subject, may be I will come back again here, thank you for this great article, any help can be appreciated.I am glad I found your site."|0
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper""."|1
"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed. )The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella."|1
15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata. However as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue'.|1
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it.|1
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the year . I'm a guy who doesn't watch movies just to read about them the next day . I'm not sure why . I have a hard enough time watching the movies without reading about them as well . I am a very visual person and a lot of movies don't translate that well to the written page . so , when I read the movie's plot description on its official website , I found it to be a bit of a disappointment .|0
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). However, the principal acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress ""Nefer""."|1
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld,after ELR and after Friends. Those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.KOQs came at the end of this special time in TV. But don't let that dissuade you.King of Queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.Seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so hard than I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs comes real close.When it comes to laughing, I have to rate KOQs second only to Seinfeld.|1
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by , no matter how bad it is. He did a series of short films for VH1 called I Hate My 30s, which I saw on DVD. The premise behind the shorts is that the main character wants to live like a teenager in their 20s, and has to come to grips with the reality that they are in their 30s, so that they won't get their hopes up in the vain expectation that life is still going to be great in a few years.|0
"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should watch it. After all I did love ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en"", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of ""The Cell"". The whole story concept is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in."|1
Ignore the bad reviews on here , this film is awesome ! `` Just Before Dawn '' is a great horror story that has a great concept and I can not wait for a second film . If you have never seen it , you must watch it . It is well worth it and if you get a chance do not pass this one up . Don't let the critics get to you because this movie has many redeeming qualities . If you can get your hands on a copy of this one , do not hesitate , rent , buy , watch it right now !|0
"This show is really great . It 's smart.It 's funny.It 's great acting and writing . This show is really good and I think they should continue this . It 's really good

This is an amazing series and I really love it. The characters are just so real, they're so different from one to the other. I've been watching it since the beginning and now I'm so happy I did. It's just a really funny show. I have been watching this show since episode 1 and it just keeps getting better. Its a great show with a really interesting premise and great characters."|0
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is.|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
( My Synopsis ) Rae ( Christina Ricci ) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie ( John Doe ) at her high school reunion and later they hook up at a local bar and get intimate on the dance floor. But when she learns that Ronnie works in porn she becomes determined to get him to make a porno starring her. First off, I have to say that this film is in the style of the classic Italian horror films from the 50s-70s. The sets, the makeup and the way they are shot are all from that style.|0
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: ""Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose."" Inside the prison, the first sign we see is ""Welcome: have a seat."" They then show an electric chair.Corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it!"|1
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role as Williams for that entire show, was Emmy worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is....WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes.|1
Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor.|1
I 'm not gon na lie . To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is yellow. The confusion arises because we are dealing with a piece of history. The movie is supposed to be entertaining, and I believe it does that , but if you're going to be entertained, it better make some sense, in my opinion. So here we are, with the story of how a bunch of young guys got together in their mid 20's, and formed a band, to play rock and roll music.|0
There 's a brand new killer on the loose , and he 's doing God 's work . Yeah right. It doesn't have to be a god, either. It could be someone or some thing who thinks he 's a god. There 's a big difference between the two. I just don't see how anyone could claim to know what happened to him. He 's not an eyewitness. I think it 's pretty safe to assume he 's not alive. He 's not around any more. If he is dead, I can understand why people are saying he 's God.|0
It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. You'll probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place.|1
This was an excellent show. It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teen aged daughter. The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. IT was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember several episodes but the one I remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I was able to keep up with the program.|1
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I.|1
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty , easily one of the most charming , off-beat , and lighthearted comedies to come along in a long time. Betty's not exactly what one might call the sharpest tool in the shed , but her love for her patients and her love life are enough to keep her smiling . What's more , the performances from the whole ensemble are wonderful . It's a bit hard to believe they're all newcomers to this sort of comedy , but they are , and make the whole movie so much fun .|0
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. Eg. When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun.|1
My favorite film this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. Set in Barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired.|1
"Come on. Anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. Anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch ""Huckleberry Hound"" episodes for 20 years straight! The takes and double-takes by the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film. Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon."|1
"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was ""not very profound."" I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die."|1
"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.The film only approximates Mika Walteri's ""The Egyptian"", in plot. A good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful!!! Performances as follows."|1
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with ""Valley of the Kings."" These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, ""The Egyptian"" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing Hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. Too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the Big Screen."|1
"I like movies that show real people ""Americans"" and tell truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that it's USA/Canda but the box states ""All Regions"". I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it."|1
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, like The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California. Along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some Navajos.|1
Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party.|1
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this.|1
After searching for 6 months , I finally found this DVD . All I can say is it was damn well worth it , it is a rare treat , I bought it and have seen it about a dozen times and still like it the next morning . I really can’t get enough of this wonderful film . If this is any indication of what the rest of the film series will be like , I can’t wait for more ! There is only one DVD , but I’ll get into this more in the review section.|0
Robin Hood : Men in Tights ( 1993 ) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks . He has had a knack for spoofing movies for many years now, most notably with Spaceballs and The Producers . This time he gets in the swing of the Robin Hood musical tradition . Robin Hood ( Danny DeVito ) is a noble thief who steals from the rich to give to the poor . That is the story , at least it was once until it has been done about 5 times . This version , however, was a little different than the rest .|0
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.This film is a pre-code because of several reasons.|1
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time.|1
This movie just might make you cooooo . The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town . Betty and I saw this film about 10 years back . Betty was just as impressed as I was ... it's the best I've seen of it . It was pretty much as she remembered . There was a great scene where they're in the hospital and Betty says that it's the most beautiful movie she's seen in years ... that scene was a little bit different, but still pretty damn cool . The whole movie is very good, though , especially the opening scene .|0
"I 'm a fan of independent film . Dialogue driven , character study pieces are where it 's at for me . As a result , I 'm usually not the biggest fan of ""big budget "" action films . For one thing , they tend to rely on big set pieces , rather than character development and the dialogue tends to be in the form of expletives . I 'll always be a fan of these movies , but I don't like them as a rule . The Expendables 1 and 2 changed all of that for me ."|0
Whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. The story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. The storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie.|1
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental stores.James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. While being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.|1
America 's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense . It has a great hostess , a great production team, and a great cast . The show is based around the theme of modelling , and has been a huge hit ever since the first season premiered . The first season of Top Model introduced the world to several very beautiful , very smart , very attractive young women . These women represented America at a fashion show in Milan , Italy in April of 2002 , where they were given top marks by the judges , and were given the name 'America's Next Top Model ' .|0
Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T.V. shows of its time.|1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about Black middle class families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many...many people who still talk about the show. If it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer-pressure and much more.|1
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ""slasher"" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great ""rare"" film from Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films ""Squirm"" and ""Blue Sunshine"".Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."|1
"""Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!"" ""Can you play dead?"" It's difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime dramedy. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's perfectly awful one-liners. Cracking out such gems as ""Adios, Blimp,"" Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch."|1
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite movies of the last few years. I've heard people say this is not the best in the series, but I disagree. The story of a man's struggle to find work in a depressed economic climate is told superbly, and it's one of the best I've ever seen. The film has a lot of depth to it and has a really wonderful cast, especially Michael Keaton and Billy Crudup who have great performances.|0
Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie.|1
Renee Zellweger is Betty , a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse , who is infatuated with a married man , gets pregnant , marries him , and then realizes that it was all a misunderstanding. The movie’s theme , as expressed in the tagline , is a simple one: “Life’s not always a bowl of cherries .” Like many movies about infidelity in which women are not as much as they had hoped , “Cher” turns on the idea that all we really need is to find out what we want in life , be it money or love.|0
When I was engaged , my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores . He would look for his favorite sex toy and then I would browse for new toys in the lingerie section. He always bought me whatever I had my heart set on. It was my birthday last night and he surprised me with the most amazing sex toy and lingerie set I can remember ever getting. I was shocked at how sexy it looked and it has made my entire experience with sex toys all that much more pleasurable. The first day I took the toy out we had a threesome.|0
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits. The others are a two part cartoon where Bugs and Daffy try to prove who is the bigger bunny and Elmer gets tired of the ""rabbits"", and another where Bugs and Daffy try to beat the time limit in a race for $1,000 while trying to solve the problem of Elmer getting the first dollar. All three episodes were produced by Chuck Jones. This cartoon marks the first appearance of Elmer Fudd and was the second in the series to be broadcast on CBS."|0
King of Queens is comic genius. Kevin James, whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife Carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. The true magic of the show However is the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, whom lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, 2006.|1
This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is wicked great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is terrific as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch.|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the Truth and Reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in developing the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions.|1
It 's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it 's either a 9/10 or a zero out of ten. This is how it works, a movie that has bad reviews on this page will always be rated low but a movie that has great reviews will always be high rated. It 's very frustrating sometimes, I 've seen a movie and it 's an incredible movie and then after two weeks later there 's a movie with a 9/10 rating and the other with a zero.|0
"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun."|1
I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading others' comments. They are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves.Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair.This movie is certainly worth your looking at.|1
"""Americans Next Top Model"" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.I kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, I did blink) It can be sad, funny, or addicting. (mostly addicting)""America's Next Top Model"" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series!"|1
Enjoyable film that gives you romance , women-on-the-verge psychodrama , work place sexual harassment , adultery , and fashion . the movie follows a young woman who works in a clothing shop and a young man who is a photographer and who falls for her , but she has been seeing his friend for months . her friend is trying to set her up with a rich man . this man has just walked into the shop and she goes and talks to him , and they start to have a relationship with each other , only for her to discover that he is married to someone else .|0
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock.|1
Finally a true horror movie . This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes when watching a horror movie. I had to look away at one part when I saw the blood. I've never been one to turn away from horror movies . But the last couple I saw were pretty cheesy . This movie had me hooked right from the start . It was great ! I loved the acting and the scenery ! The story is really cool as well ! The acting was really good and I felt like i was there with them .|0
Sure , it has its pretentious moments , it plays like art-house , live-action Fantasia , but it also has it's moments where it is pure magic . It's one of those films you need to see live-action with someone you know , someone who shares your sense of awe at animation . The movie starts off with an introduction to the story , that's the same way all the other movies do . The story is about a young boy named Elliot who lives in a quiet little town called Springbrook . He is a happy-go-lucky type of kid who just wants to be by himself .|0
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That being said, I think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. This is not the fault of the boys however. They even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption.|1
If there's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other, It's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. Besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by Marvin Miller, pretty much everything. And it won the Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1950. Glad to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how awesome!|1
Based on Mika Waltari's Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.The Plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording,But all in all it has a strong social content:Man is ruled by his emotions,and that every action has an equal consequence.But to truly enjoy this film,First see the movie,then read the book.Although different,it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen,and gives breath to some more of the depth of Sinuhe.|1
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak.|1
"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""the murder mystery"", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced)."|1
Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others.How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of Ugly Betty), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop.|1
I get really fed up with sitcoms ; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to have any fun or surprise, you can predict the characters and the direction of each scene. I don't watch much TV anymore but if I do the same thing pops up on screen all the time and I feel a little sad that I know so well that I'll never really know what it is all about. The most recent example for me is a show where the lead character is a middle-aged man who has been through the whole emotional roller coaster of the last year.|0
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class . The musicianship of this group of musicians is simply unparallelled . This is the type of music that makes you want to sit down and just listen . This is the kind of music you want to go home and listen to and think of all the good times you've had on your life . There's plenty to listen to on their website and you should take a listen if you like any kind of blues . The band have recorded a few songs that you can get via their website , which I would recommend .|0
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and more!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and ""starring"" KANE. WWE might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park ""sport"" and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT!!"|1
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it.Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it.|1
I have n't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater , and I have been meaning to get it. I don't think that they can get away with this anymore, it's time that this movie gets remade into something that makes sense. I just hope that this is not the last time I get to see this character. This is the 1st movie that I thought that I was watching was real. This is the 1st one that I am going to buy, so that I can support it.|0
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I didn't have great taste back then (not to say that I do now) so I can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, worth watching. I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash.|1
Robin Hood ; Men in Tights is worth watching , I recently watched it because I 've just become a fan of the character , Robin is an honest, brave , kind-hearted and brave man .He does have flaws ,like most men do , but Robin is a pretty cool guy . I 've never heard any of the movies or TV series ,but I must admit ,they are pretty good . Robin Hood is a character in literature, folklore, and other cultural traditions that is generally regarded as an archetypal representation of chivalrous and virtuous behavior and as a legendary folk hero of medieval England.|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare , and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling . It 's not a movie that will make you laugh , but it 'll make you smile . There isn 't too much , but the things that they do are done very well . And there 's always something to like . It 's nice to find that sort of movie that makes you feel good all over . Susan Sarandon is a very good actress . She doesn 't need too many words . It 's just a matter of her being able to get into her part and give it her all .|0
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there . Alright , more than a little ... but it would be hard to describe how out there this movie is with words . It is like you are looking into the future when this thing is released . So , what exactly is this movie about ? It revolves around a family with four children that is trying to protect their home against an alien invasion . It has some really good action and some really silly stuff . It has a little bit of everything in it .|0
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVD's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new. The film. The film is a re run of certain episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School and numerous others with a different edge. Introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move - especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque (something that is rarely done now).It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting up and training.|1
With Nurse Betty ( 2000 ) , acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute ( In the Company of Men , Your Friends & Neighbors ) produced an exquisitely constructed, emotionally gripping and ultimately very moving film about a troubled marriage. With Nurse Betty is the story of a marriage that has long outstayed its welcome; a marriage that has come to mean little to either party. This is a film that’ll stay with you, long after the credits roll. As the title implies, it is a comedy that deals with many of the most serious matters we face in our lives: marriage, money, infidelity.|0
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest , most clever , sharp-witted , sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I 've ever watched. I 've watched all the seasons over a period of about a year and a half. But, as you know, I am a writer and a journalist. I can only watch an entire show so many times in my life before it gets boring to me, especially if I know the whole plotline before watching the show. I have to keep coming back to it because it is such a great show, but eventually the show gets to me.|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!|1
I 'm absolutely disgusted this movie is n't being sold . All who love this movie should email Disney and tell them they should be ashamed of themselves for the way they do business . By the way the movie has been in theatres for over 30 years . If you have not seen it then you have not lived . The movie is called The Lion King ! I'm still shocked this isn't being shown in cinemas, it's such an iconic piece of Disney and a movie that's very dear to many people. The Lion King has been in cinemas since the early 90s!|0
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot , while still maintaining the pace. It’s not the most complex plot in comics, but that’s the point, and the pace allows for a little more depth. There’s a few moments in King of the Underworld when the plot feels a little bit forced and I find myself feeling like the issues are dragging a little bit, but it’s only a few minutes and then the pace picks back up.|0
Okay I marked this spoiler so do n't be upset when I wrap this up . Now I went into this knowing there were many ways to go with it and how the end would turn out. I actually did n't see the twist until it happened. And I'm shocked... I have seen this show before in some other translation but I am not sure if it was the original. It was really good. I do n't know if the English version I was watching was an adaption of this one. I am not sure if it was the original but I did n't hate it .|0
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are preparing to raid their way west. The Mormons, who are carrying a wagon loaded with loot, decide they want to hire the two horse traders for the rest of the journey, because they are afraid of the group's leader. The group leader, in return, promises them the money to continue their journey, plus a third of all loot they acquire, and that he will kill the group leader when he finds him.|0
"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for ""Dr. David Ravell"" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of ""A Reason to Love"", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles."|1
Wow ! An amazing , lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one . This is an amazing find , one of the most obscure treasures you can find on the internet . The story goes something like this .. . It was around 1970 , at the peak of the 70s glam-rock explosion . It was in the studio , recording with a local Perth band called “ The Chantays “ . After recording some tracks , they decided they wanted a glam-rock film . They sent the film out to be processed , and they thought they would wait a while , until they had the money .|0
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have.|1
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (get us in). This is ""our movie"" and the music is ""our songs"". Michelle's song is ""our"" song. Yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. She is left alone with child."|1
America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately i have become bored with it.cycle 1: yeah I'm happy Adrienne won, i wanted her to win from the beginning.cycle 2: its too bad, i think Mercedes deserved it.cycle 3: i did not like Eva, but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle.cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. i don't know what they saw in Naima, but i definitely know what they saw in Kahlen.cycle 5: like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either.|1
This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes.|1
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental."|1
I liked this a lot . The camera angles are cool , it 's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch thing and I really did like how there was just the right amount of mystery. I did like how they gave us a bit more info on what was going on but there wasn't too much info. I don't like how they showed you how long the girl was with the guy even though it was only a couple seconds , that 's just really creepy . But I guess that 's why I'm scared of the girl .|0
"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for."|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary , it is obviously a labor of love and a great documentary that I believe should be made into a movie.The documentary starts with an introduction and narration by the documentary makers .The introduction gives an interesting insight into some of their personal backgrounds. It also gives an overview of how they came into creating the documentary . In the first part of the documentary I was given the impression that the makers of the documentary have some idea of where their film is going .I was also told that there would be some interesting twists and turns along the way.|0
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. From start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. Even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. If you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch.|1
1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in the wild. A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers.|1
It has been recorded that John Ford made the `` big , blockbuster '' movies so that he could afford to go and live a very comfortable life . And that he made these films for a specific reason, which we will get to very shortly . There are those that say that is because he was a rebel , a renegade , a rebel against his time . He was an icon of the American western , a man who made westerns that changed the way Americans saw the American west . He was the most successful director in history, having made the most money .|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enraptured in Orry and Madenline's love story. I am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie.|1
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment ! It is an energetic show and has a fabulous soundtrack. It also has a good storyline and great dances. The dancing is really good, the acting is very strong (especially that of the female lead) and the dancers are really well coordinated. The sets and costumes are very impressive, and the dances are very well executed. I saw the show last Thursday night and I really recommend this show to any Irishman who wants to know more of the Irish culture and dance.|0
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason..that is until the Lone Ranger discovers from a conversation with the Indian Chief Tomache that each man possessed a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it?|1
"The best of everything. Just what is the best of everything? It is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. But alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes,""we are the captains of our own ships"", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. Once we make those choices then we must live with them."|1
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! When I first tuned in to America's Next Top Model, I expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. I didn't. This show is actually serious fun. I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's Next top model. And it so does! Who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what it's REALLY like.|1
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter 's voice , there is that old familiar feeling of 70 's blues . It has been said that she is the Queen of Rock n Roll and I would not disagree . Her voice is so soulful and beautiful that I feel like I am hearing the Queen of Rock and Roll . I did not get to see a lot of music as a child but I remember listening to Karen Carpenter 's voice on the radio . I knew her voice because her voice was as familiar to my ears as my Mom 's . She was the Queen .|0
I LOVE this movie. and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where I can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. All these Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring.|1
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address ""Mithi/Mithali"" (Konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. ""Prof.Anu"" (Shabhana Azmi)is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from Mithi's mom's earlier marriage. The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through her continuous blabbering to Anu and others. Konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which I am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of Mithi in this movie."|1
This one started excellently . The photography and audio are the best I 've experienced in years ( okay , that might be a bit high , but you get the point ). So far it has all the signs of being a good series. I don't know about the other two, but I really hope you guys do the other two, because I think this will be one of your best series yet. It's a pretty good start. The photography and audio are top notch, but the story is really slow. It started really strong, but it just gets boring.|0
Just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded.|1
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted ""naturally"" and you ""felt"" for them in the respective roles. A ""glossy"" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January, 2005."|1
My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own. This was one film I was really, really looking forward to seeing. A big budget blockbuster starring two of Hollywood’s biggest superstars was the perfect combination to make my year. That’s not to say this was a perfect film. It’s definitely not and it definitely isn’t the best film of 2016 or of the past 5 years, however it is a film I can happily add to the pile of good films that are available to watch and enjoy.|0
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction . This is what today 's documentaries are all about . It shows us how people of the past lived and worked on a daily basis and it tells us of the hardships they had to bear . But the main thing is , this film is about human life, about the life we all lead , the life we all have to face . The story is well told by a great director who knows exactly what he is doing and he makes us think about all the little things we all go through in a day ..... and this film shows how people lived .|0
Most of these reviews are dead on, so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here.While the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. Here in the USA, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused.|1
i love this movie. is it on air anymore? what can i do to get it on air again because i miss this movie when does this movie air again? i love this movie so much. does anyone know how long it has been since it was last on Disney?it has been a very very long time and i am so sick of waiting!i want to see Susie Q again. i swear, they take all the good movies off air and play new stupid gay ones that are fake and retarded.|1
`` The Cell '' is a rather difficult film to classify . If you read the plot outline , `` It 's an action/mystery/thriller . And if you look at the film's credits , you will find that the story is actually based on a novel by an unknown writer . What I can definitely tell you, though, is that this movie has a lot of potential . A great deal of energy is captured in this film . There are a lot of ideas and themes which have the possibility to be developed . I 'd love to find out more about this movie .|0
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture , 'Wagon Master ' made after two big Indian-cavalry battles in the West in which the cavalry was in the lead. That picture won the hearts of the people . It did not seem that the cavalry had anything to brag of that year and the next in the long, long war of the Indian-Apache against the white man. It was a good deal to brag of when in a campaign of four years the mounted troops, led by Gen. Crook, had captured some 10,000 Indians, half of them women and children, and killed 2,000 of them.|0
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. If I remember correctly we had to watch it on a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days UHF not part of regular TV to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk. A great memory from 50+ years ago.|1
Maybe it 's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel , or a fondness for Waltari the author, but the story feels real to me in some odd way. It 's not a book you read , it is a book where you experience the story . For a long time , I have been thinking about starting on the story again. The time and distance have made the decision easier . There is something so special about this story I think it has to be read in the right atmosphere , it would be difficult to read in another setting than one 's own home.|0
"The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar (""The Saint"") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as ""Pearly"" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool!"|1
I really like this show . It has drama , romance , and comedy all rolled into one . I can't wait until next week . It will be interesting who wins this competition . I will be watching this show every week until the end . So far , it has not disappointed me at all ! I am definitely looking forward to the end results . The show opens with the girls waiting for their next challenge. Each of them has a list of ingredients they must go and get from the grocery store, and they must come up with a gourmet meal for the guys.|0
"This movie was awesome , if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. It's funny and you can just laugh it off. But if you're sensitive , you might be able to take the few bad ones in the movie and laugh about it with friends. This is a must see. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful.Was this review helpful to you? The best comedy ever

I'm going to write a review about this movie right now... This is a very good movie I would highly recommend watching it."|0
I got this movie with my BBC `` Jane Austen Collection '' ( 5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations ) . It was a very nice treat and I have to admit - I enjoyed it . I can't say I really like the books but I've read them quite a few time and I've always found them a very pleasant read . This one was better than some others I've seen ( The others were of Jane Austen novels I've read before but they were not really adaptations . I think they were more in the line of historical movies and I'm not interested in those ).|0
When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside.|1
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: the Music Hall..I know what is and what is not associated with the New York venue. The film's Theodore is just the ""Music Hall."" No Rockettes are in the film. Only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. Just thought you would like to know. Truly a wonderful film. You will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating."|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain).|1
`Skenbart' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945, which it does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'Gunnar' played by the, in Sweden, famous actor Gustav Hammarsten.|1
"I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland , and it was worth it just to watch it. I could have watched it all day, every day. I don't think that a film like this gets made with enough frequency these days. I have a lot of complaints about it: the pacing, the music, the acting, the plot. I don't really like to say that something is ""not for me"" so I'll just go ahead and state that this is not a good film for anyone."|0
This movie is Wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin hood is Perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is the funniest character, along with Latrine and the Sheriff! While space balls got boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great film, and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles, and it is spoofed perfectly, and makes so much sense, and can be watched again and again!|1
Michelle , Anicée Alvina , was so nice , and I really fall in love with her . She died in 1994 , in an car accident . She left behind a son , Maximilien , from her marriage with Jean-Luc , a musician and actor . She was born and raised in Brittany , in a small village called Guérande . There was one thing that she could not do , because of the life that she lead . It was impossible for her to be part of the normal French life . It was because she had another kind of life , a very dark one .|0
I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience which shows up on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story.|1
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm , wit , and charm . At age 16 Lorelai became a mother . As her daughter Rory struggles to get her life together , she tries to find a balance between work and home . She has an amazing group of friends , a mother of two sons and an ex-girlfriend . There are many funny scenes that happen in this show , but there are also sad parts as well . For me this is one of my most favorite shows of all time but I don't think it gets enough recognition .|0
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school basketball All-Star game held in front of a packed crowd in New York. The game is supposed to be played between the top all-stars from each state in the U.S. In the state of New York there are four different regions, so the teams are made up of all-star players from different areas. While trying to make the best of an awkward situation for him, the young man learns that he is being played to see if he can make good on a bet made by his high school friends.|0
This movie has a lot to recommend it . The paintings , the music , and David Hewlett 's nakedly brilliant performance as the narrator are all first-rate. The plot has a nice twist at the end and David Hewlett is terrific. The movie opens as David Hewlett , a young man, leaves a New York hospital having been released following an accident that has rendered him speechless. As he drives to his parents ' home he has a flashback to events that occurred over 30 years earlier . On that night he and his friends had driven to an isolated lake to drink beer and play pool .|0
"does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this . I have been looking for it and it seems it does not exist anywhere , I even searched this video on google with no avail. A:

There is an interview with Kiehl in the DVD set of The Essential Kiehl, Vol. 1. You can find it on youtube. He mentions the scene in the film, and explains that this was one of the scenes that he cut from the final edit of the film."|0
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! I enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ! OK the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! Some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films..|1
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really do n't approve of pornography all that much, and i don't want to see it in a movie so that it can be sold at the theatre (it's already too easy to purchase it in the streets), i don't want to see it in the movies, on TV or in any other form so that it can be sold to me without my consent. However, this is the most realistic depiction of prostitution that i've ever seen! It's done well. It's realistic enough.|0
I absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: I am from Romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on USA TV I check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I become to know absolutely everything about them I looked on the internet what's Rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria.|1
There 's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster , Sergeant Rutledge , and The Searchers . All of these films, along with She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, The Quiet Man, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence, and Rio Grande are considered to be Ford classics. Wagonmaster , Sergeant Rutledge , and The Searchers especially have this place because all three of these films feature John Wayne 's most iconic character, The Duke . These are the three films that defined him, the films that brought him the most success.|0
One of the best ! As being a fan of the civil war , I was very pleased with the accuracy in the presentation and story line . The story line is very intriguing and keeps you on the edge of your seat to find out if there is a happy or bad ending for the main characters . The action sequences were very exciting and kept up my interest . There is a lot of dialogue but the dialog was well written to make it seem natural . The plot is well written and well executed . This is a must read for all fans of the civil war .|0
You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. It's a masterpiece. I want to see a film with this level of thoughtfulness and sophistication. It doesn't even attempt to be accessible. If it had been more accessible, the audience would have been disappointed and that would not have been the point. The fact that the audience was engaged and engaged in a meaningful way is the entire purpose of this film. I felt like I was sitting with some of the greatest intellectuals in human history.|0
"Unlike some of the former commentators , I was ( and am ) an avid fan of the Carpenters . My father was a fan of the Carpenters as well and they were one of my early musical inspirations . I spent many nights in my youth listening to them ( when my parents would let me have music )

The Carpenters , just like many artists of that era were a product of the culture in which they lived , their music reflected the world around them . Their lyrics , music and art was part of the culture of their time ."|0
Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door Jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys try their best to locate Jimmy, meaning no more Jimmy if they get their hands on him.|1
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. It was the kind of a movie that I wanted to have, but didn’t actually think I would. However this is a good thing. As someone who is usually a moviegoer of the theater, it’s much more satisfying to see something on the big screen when you’re actually there. So, this was an experience that was much better than I ever imagined it to be. I loved every single thing about this movie.|0
This movie makes you think . It shows how a woman 's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others . If you think a lot about women and their body parts you 'll have nightmares tonight . It was a very erotic , scary and suspenseful movie that made me have to see the end . If it were not for the ending you 'd be left with some unanswered questions . If you like good movies this is one you should see right now . The acting , special effects , editing and cinematography were excellent . The story kept you wondering what was really going to happen .|0
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming, and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it.|1
"I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC , or any big city of mid-century New York. It is called ""The Last Days of Disco"", and is about disco in NYC, and how disco was replaced by house, techno, acid house, electro, hip-hop, techno, and the rest. Here's the synopsis: ""The disco scene in the late 1970's was at its zenith, with music, fashion, and celebrities. In 1978, disco entered into a state of decline."|0
"""L'Auberge Espagnole"" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. And it is wise by the way. ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona."|1
Brian ( Wesley Eure ) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton ( Conrad Bain ) . The security firm monitors all the police activity in the city. They record all their findings on a CD. On this CD they find evidence that Mr. Norton is a murderer and that he killed two people in a previous life . Mr. Norton thinks he killed someone else in a past life too. He wants to hire Brian as his new employee and asks Brian for a sample tape. Brian doesn't trust Norton but is willing to give him one.|0
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. The unbelievable story of A GUY who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. Gosh, is this what life made us be? People deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? ""Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore""."|1
"Sweeping drama with great sets , costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett , Scarlett , Melanie , and Ashley

The first time I saw the movie of Gone with the Wind (GwTW)  I had been a fan of Rhett Butler for years as a character on television  was in a theater that didn't have air conditioning. I sat with my head down for the duration of the 2 1/2-hour movie. When the film was over I looked up and noticed that the temperature had gone from a comfortable 78°F to 102°F. My ears and face were still red, and my lips were swollen."|0
I get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. I have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and I am surprised at just how much I am enjoying it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait.|1
"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice pronounces the words ""Puerto Rican"" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, called ""Old Acquaintance"", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other."|1
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox 's reluctance to release a DVD/Bluray combo of 'V for Vendetta' with the extra scenes that were originally included in the special edition DVD, but which are not available on the DVD released by Warner Bros in 2007 (unless you go to the extra DVD features and buy it). This film is very much an allusion to the real world events of late 2006 in the UK and a message of hope and rebellion against what has gone before.|0
Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie . They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances for good acting. Candice’s character in particular is very compelling. The movie’s first scene shows her going into a drugstore to purchase something to calm her upset stomach. It’s a brief scene but the chemistry between the two is clear from the first take. Candice has a good sense for what’s funny in this movie . She knows when to smile or grimace or be serious. The chemistry between them is strong from the get-go.|0
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story  Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona  you predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure.|1
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) began watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far.|1
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world.|1
Cant believe it .... after all these years finally tracked this down .. it was meant to be named 'The Black Knight' ... so I got the idea to call it that ... after all the years it took to track it down I think I deserve to name it as I own it. I remember seeing it when I was young and being so amazed at it's size ... I think it may have been one of a kind ... no others came to the market place .. I have no idea if that was a one off or just a special run ...|0
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents house and got a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. The girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and TV shows, and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents.|1

I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn ` t get to see the original teleplay untill a few weeks ago. The only thing I noticed was that some of the old cast had their names changed. I can` t seem to place their names. Can someone give me an idea on which ones they were? I` m sure it`s been a long, long time, but can you help me find out who did the first and third voiceovers for the episodes? I` d love to know.|0
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job. The movie's point is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view.The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age. The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over. Although the text of `The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.|1

I saw `` The Reader '' at a film festival in Manhattan this week . It touched my heart in ways I can only begin to describe. The film has been selected as the opening night film at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival. It is the first time a film based on an old book has been selected to the festival. It is the first time that someone has made a film about Turgenev . And it is the very first film made about his novel `` Fathers and Children '' that I have ever read.|0
"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted ""Rodeo"" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style."|1
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!|1
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V . and came across a show I used to watch as a child named, “What’s My Line?” There was an old man on the panel named, “Maurice LeBore.” I stopped watching for a minute and wondered if he was still alive. He was and he was in town. I asked the receptionist where and she told me. I was so happy to see this man again. After greeting me, he said “I didn’t recognize you.|0
One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot but I was pleasantly surprised at this film, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway.|1
"it 's the best movie i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! ! i just love them ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! so many great parts in this movie ! ! ! ! so many funny parts and the music ! ! ! was really cool and so many great characters ! ! ! and i love that this movie have so many funny parts ! ! ! ! ! i just love this movie a lot and i just can't wait 
to see it again and i just hope that it will get a 
best picture nomination ! ! !"|0
In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once.|1
`` Two Hands '' is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life and fiction that characterised the first wave of Australian films in the 1930's, and that seems to continue in the current crop. We are introduced to the characters in the narrative, and watch their relationship evolve as their lives unfold. The film, written and directed by Frank Harvey, was shot on location in Perth, Australia in March, 1934. It is a melodrama about a country doctor, who, after a failed marriage, is attracted to a new girl at the local hospital.|0
People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also, for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now.|1
"""Two Hands"" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity."|1
"Great Movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song ""Honey Roll"" and poem ""I Meant To Do My Work Today"" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film!"|1
"""Jaded"" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. This director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. The rape is brutal not sexual."|1
GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen.. He acts it up, perfectly. This was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is.. It almost made me cry watching him.I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend to John Belushi as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. Very sad, what both of them went through.I really felt for both Val and Robin during his rough times.|1
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. A true, polished, diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character ""Conrack"") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. At first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home."|1
This movie is VERY LONG, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you are a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) My mother is a Civil War buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off TV), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance.|1
"I don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, ""that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS"". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. I must tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision."|1
I too saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since and I wander why it has gone to the wayside.|1
Hmm , is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar 's post Saved By The Bell acting ? I saw Tiffani in Saved By The Bell. It wasn't her acting but the voice of her character, Lisa Turtle that caught me, and made me love her character. I also loved Mark-Paul in Saved By The Bell . He was just so cute and cool. He played a character that I've never read about in a TV series before. In my opinion, he was the most perfect person I had ever seen in all the TV series that I'd watched.|0
"Although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...I just HAD to live in New York. It has great opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis crooning ""Romance is still...the best of everything..."" that rival those of West Side Story. There is a rather stilted performance by the world's REAL first Supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry about that, Janice D.), but it's great eye-candy!"|1
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.|1
"Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms , I thought I would get them all done now in one post and share my thoughts on their strengths and weaknesses. In order of appearance:

Perry and Croft in The Two Ronnies - BBC - 1983-1988. This was the second sitcom I had seen which featured a pair of double act comedians (though in this case they played more than two characters) and the first one I had actually seen. It was the first BBC comedy I ever caught, and it was one that has stuck with me since."|0
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a ""family saga"" rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion."|1
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park . Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to make his teacher Mrs. Crabtree go insane. It's one of the most hilarious episodes from the last few South Park seasons, so let's get started right away with the full episode below, including the full South Park credits in the top section, and an embedded video after the jump for those who want to watch the full thing, but don't have time to wait for a regular video post. Meanwhile, Kyle has gotten in trouble for having a porn magazine on school grounds.|0
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate.|1
I was expecting this movie to suck , but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film . Most of it was shot well and had a nice flow to the story . And the story line was really well put together . The acting was ok but some were really bad . But the one thing i didnt care for was the gore , i would have prefered it to have been less , or even just as intense as it is now . I did like the characters , and they all looked pretty good in some way . And i liked how they tied everything together .|0
It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of `` slasher '' movies in the early 1980 's , that there would have been a sequel to the 1979 film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (TCSM). The film was a surprise success for AIP , and was the last big money film that the company would produce . A few years earlier , AIP had made the infamous The Hills Have Eyes , a movie that was a big flop . But in the year following the release of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, they found themselves back on top with their next film , The House on Haunted Hill.|0
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label.|1
This film , released in 1951 , has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50 's : a hero with his gun, an evil man , a beautiful woman who falls in love with him... and a little girl who becomes the heroine. It begins in 1885 in a town in the west, a time and place that is still remembered with nostalgia. In this place lived a little girl ... and that little girl will change the lives of many people . This little girl is Emma, the daughter of a poor farmer, and her mother died giving birth .|0
On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching.|1
This film blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot. After watching this, I see I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. It's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. It was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper.|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years . I rate it one of my top 3 comedies of all time. It is just so easy to watch. It's funny. It's about women. And I love it because it takes place in Queens. It's just a funny show, and I love that it has a woman's perspective on everything. I have seen every season of that show from the beginning and it will always be one of my favorites. I had a great laugh when I read that the new season would have a woman's POV perspective.|0
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point."|1
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.|1
"Hallelujah ! ! ! ! Finally , a true Colombian film crosses the border ( s ) to shows how life is ! In the movie ""El Hijo del Pasionaria"" directed by Pablo Hidalgo and produced by Juan Pablo Rodriguez ( who was one of the writers and actors ), a young journalist who is looking for a job , finds the door of an abandoned building where he encounters a gang of boys , who he quickly becomes friends with and in the process , discovers an incredible world of violence that will make us think, laugh and cry."|0
See No Evil With Kane . The Movie Has a great storyline But it just was n't a Hide my ass movie. It was a Hide your head in the sand. It got boring quickly. I just could not believe that he could be so bad. I thought he would have something better to say. I mean I just could not believe that he was so bad. It was so predictable and the story line was so unbelievable. I could not believe that the character he played would say or do those things. So I just did not believe him.|0
honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can't ever get enough Gilmore!|1
This movie was so cool ! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends . I like the action and the story .The actors were pretty good , I think . One of my friends said he thinks the actors who are in this movie will be the ones to replace the ones in the Spider-man movies . That is true because of the actor's that were in this . He thinks they will be great in the Spider-Man movies . This movie was one of the coolest . If you like Spider-man movies and you have seen it before , you will probably like this .|0
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clichéd but still true, know what I'm saying.I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I'm more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France.|1
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning , and have felt it is overlooked at the award show. The show is so much more than the sitcom it is known for being. It is the perfect comedy. It is funny, poignant, touching, ridiculous, and sometimes disturbing. It has great guest star turns and is well done. In addition to being a great sitcom with a great theme , it is a show about family , about love and life. There is no sex on the show , and no sex talk , at least that I remember .|0
"Well, I'm a few days late but what the hell....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to ""See No Evil"" was....SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. Think ""Madman"" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick."|1
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking . I 'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and to those with a strong belief . I hope that this movie will encourage you to do more and to take more action against the corruption in your country, and that you and your children will be the next generation to make a change . Thank you for doing your part for your country and humanity! I loved the fact that it was a movie that didn't make you feel sorry for anyone. It was real, and it showed that corruption can exist in any country.|0
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts , unlike many other great Ford films , like Dances with Wolves or The Man With No Name , but it is well worth a viewing. This movie is not only entertaining in many respects , but also contains a good deal of accurate historical information , and it is very easy to follow . So here it is , for those of us who love Ford but don’t know much of anything about the American West (except for the stuff in High Plains Drifter) .|0
"After getting hooked on the mini series, ""North & South,"" I could hardly wait for the continuation, ""North & South II."" Then years later, along came Book III, ""HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III."" FINALLY, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so enraptured by this series that I taped each part off of TV and then managed to get family and friends hooked and I watched it AGAIN, each time someone new wanted to see them."|1
America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do, therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.But it's obvious that its intention is not to present the America's next top model, but yes, the America's Next Pop Model.|1
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in ""Desk Set"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in ""Nanny & the Professor""."|1
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed . Very funny and the production quality is outstanding . It is also well researched and written . The story is told in three sections with each section beginning as a flashback and then progressing forwards to the present and finally back again as a flashback . This is a great idea and it is carried out extremely well . The characters are well drawn and it is the script which gives them character and the humour comes from their actions and interaction . A great piece of cinema which I strongly recommend to all .|0
Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much . The theme was well handled by the Director with great humor and entertainment . I recommend this movie to all . Thank you for making it . I would like to share this movie to you if you are interested to see a family movie .I liked the movie with my family and friends . I like the character of the main actor in this movie and he performed it well , the story was also interesting and the main actors were good .I like the family movie because it has comedy and romance also .I would recommend this movie to you .|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies , and this is actually the second time in my life where I have watched a film that is written in Swedish . I usually end up watching English movies or other foreign language films. However , I decided to watch this and I am happy that I did. This is the story about a group of students at a university who start a fight against a teacher , a woman. The teacher had a relationship with one of the students , and that student ends up killing himself .|0
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back ""in the wayback machine"" to the farcical movies that Hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff. Oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching."|1
"If I 'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty , I probably would n't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. That 's not saying it was a bad movie - far from it - just that I wasn 't expecting to see much of Nurse Betty 's story on the screen, not that it 's completely irrelevant. The film is about Betty 's quest to get her nursing license and she is accompanied on that quest by three of her friends and one of her ""friends"" is a fellow nurse who wants to get in bed with her."|0
spoiler -- In 1993 , African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with a big budget sci-fi-comedy starring Ice Cube and James Woods, as well as a talented young actress named Angela Basset. In the movie, the main characters are kidnapped from Africa and taken to a secret underground military laboratory in the US, where they're used to fight in a never ending war. Unfortunately, after the credits roll, the story ends there, and it's up to the viewer to decide for themselves what actually happened next.|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
I couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.|1
I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations , discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional breakdowns. After having viewed the film, I must say I was completely wrong. This is not an ordinary film. It deals with the problems of a wealthy family with a very complex and interesting plot, which I could not possibly explain in one sentence. It is a must see film, if you dare to watch films from this genre, which I would recommend to most of you. However, I have a few reservations regarding this film, as I have seen a few films with similar topics.|0
"Most of these reviews are dead on , so I 'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of the more interesting questions I've been asked. What kind of gear should you expect to be spending $500 on? What are the key features to look for? I 'll give you my thoughts on the top ten of each type of bike and what I 'd say to the buyer. If the price is right and you like what you see, go ahead and grab it. Let 's roll. Road:

I have to admit, some of the bikes on this list are a surprise to me."|0
I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool . I was wondering when it would come out on dvd and got lucky as the movie was released in the US on December 21, 2006. I was really looking forward to the movie and it came out on dvd the following day so it was a day early . There is not any extra features that I know of as the movie was released on dvd with the film. I watched the movie at home and it was a pretty decent dvd .|0
Yes, this is one of the better done television movies and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a great fan of The Carpenters, I got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and I got to do much of the solo material of which Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman.|1
I'm certain that people from USA don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the USA. The only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the USA and Islamic nations. In France, for instance, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it's 14. In Spain it's 12. So the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal.|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I've just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast, they are so funny.|1
I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound effect on me. In fact, I have seen this movie more than a dozen of times since then and that is saying something! This review of the film was written prior to seeing the film with the intent of writing a review which could stand up to any of the recent reviews that I have seen written on this film. I have read a number of reviews that were written prior to this movie's release.|0
This comment discusses `` North and South Book I '' dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is covered in a book titled `` North and South '' by the Pulitzer Prize Winning writer William Manchester. The book is written from a left-wing point of view and paints an image of a society in which blacks were held in slavery while the northern states enjoyed a high standard of living and free education. It is based on the best-seller book by the same title published in 1958 by William Styron. The book is very well written.|0
I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim , California in 2005. We were both surprised by the quality of this film. When we first saw it , it wasn’t until after we had returned home from that vacation and went to my local theater that I realized this movie was based on a true story and not just fiction. I remember that it was just before I graduated high school and the movie was released in theaters a couple of years later that I came to realize how this movie might not have a happy ending.|0
One of the best! As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.|1
The show is GREAT . No words to describe it . Wonderful music . Incredible dance . The editors could do no wrong. You can tell that this was just for fun for the viewers, but they pulled out the stops and put it on a high level for sure . I’ll have to say that it may have been my favorite show of last year because it’s just a great show that I love being there and watching every week. It really is one of the top rated shows in terms of entertainment and music.|0
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it.|1
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made, ""Murder in the Music Hall"" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. A shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious Rockettes--among them, Vera Ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delectable B-movie starlets of the '40s."|1
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store , this was when it was a new release . the movie is about an actor who has an affair with his assistant . the actress who played his mistress is a very beautiful young woman , her name was rita . she has a baby with her lover , the actress was very upset about her baby ,
she took her boyfriend away from her baby , she never had time for her ,
the boyfriend got married with her , then the actress was told that their baby died when he was only one years old ."|0
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theater (and on television). It is an extremely funny comedy that will not disappoint you. The film stars Robert De Niro as a New York city cop who makes a mistake and goes to jail. He goes on a jailhouse date with a girl (Kathleen Quinlan) and she helps him. In the film you will see some great performances by the leads, a lot of great music and a lot of comedy.|0
My wife and I saw this when we were 17 . The only good thing my father ever did (besides being an alcoholic) was to raise us and we owe a lot of who we are to him. I was a bit of a misfit, a bit of a punk, and my dad gave me a place to be it. And I have tried to return the favor by helping others in similar positions. But it's not enough for me anymore. I want a little more. I really don't have anything to offer. I want to go out with the old crew.|0
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (4 February, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours."|1
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of ""Rawhide"" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out."|1
At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late.|1
"This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, ""By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead? ""Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the ""Claw"" or Saw."|1
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies , along with Spaceballs ( although I will openly admit that the Mel Brooks Spaceballs movie is more fun ) and History of the World, Part 1. For some odd reason, though, I have a hard time seeing it in theaters. Maybe I'm just a fan of old-school comedy, but I've found that the new breed of comedy just don't get the laughs for me like the old, black and white flicks used to. But that's all a matter of personal taste.|0
Fata Morgana , the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog , filmed over several years in the early 1970s, was one of the most challenging, frustrating and ultimately rewarding films of all time. It was made at the very peak of Herzog's powers as a filmmaker, in the early-to-mid 1970s - the same period that saw the release of Fata Morgana , the 1972 film from which the film drew its title . For the most part, the story goes something like this. Werner Herzog is an extremely talented, well-regarded German filmmaker who is well-loved among both critics and audiences for his adventurous and experimental style.|0
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?The answer become less clear as the film goes on.Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.Chris Rock  though as foul-mouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as Wesley.|1
The above summary really is n't meant as a slam against this film , as the series followed a very specific formula , and this film really sticks to that form . i do have to admit though as i said , i really am not a fan , but it is very well made , and i do have to say i liked it . i can see why it did well , but as i said earlier it would have made much more money if it would have stuck to it's own formula , and not tried to go outside it .|0
Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native Italy. His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.)|1
"I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it listed on the schedule at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, and I vowed I would make the 40 minute drive. The Stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When ""The Best of Everything"" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the New York City skyline, I knew I was right for waiting.I lapped this movie up."|1
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)""Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things."" --Catherine DeaneAnd so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, ""The Cell"" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it."|1
I 'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of the title. I guess you were all too busy trying to find something to bash or criticize, instead of listening to the actual words in the book and understanding the message in them. If you don't like it, don't read it, but you'd better stop bashing the book or you'll be sorry you did. This book was meant to be taken seriously, and I think you all took it as a joke. This is not a book for kids.|0
"I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a ""typical"" human alike or different than Rose? Lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy?"|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it ! It is so sweet and heartwarming , the acting is great, and the cinematography makes this movie even better ! There are 3 main characters in this movie . The first main character is Henry (played by Owen Wilson ) , the guy who is having trouble with his marriage and his love life , because he is not really attracted to any girls . He doesn't understand women and he has no desire to have sex , so he is trying to avoid all women and just stay at home.|0
Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It seems to have already died. Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. I don't know why. It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I've seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne, and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland isn't up to those others. I was just fascinated with the filmmaking.|1
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job Mr. Lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! Though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! Overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars!|1
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film 's main achievements . When you hear a vague outline of the story  the boy goes on a journey into the woods to find his mother, is attacked by a creature and saved by a wolf  it's easy to picture it. What you do not picture is the fact that you are watching an actual story . The characters , the dialogues, the actions, all of it has been done a thousand times, in a thousand different films. It's all been seen before . And yet , for some reason or other , it all works very well here.|0
"This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photography is notably confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love ""Oz"". The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. That similarity suggests that ""Oz"" was far ahead of its time."|1
I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. Granted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end.But what are they? Well, it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original, but it is better presented than other films of its kind.|1
"The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter 's complex life . Though it fails in several ways to portray the artist as a whole, it does capture the essence of her life and music . This is a documentary about Karen Carpenter's early life in California , her rise to fame, her untimely death at the age of 30 , and the legacy left by the pop music classic ""I Want You To Love Me."" It is a very well-made tribute to the late Karen Carpenter's career and life ."|0
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time with such a stupid show and its ridiculous plot twists. It's not a very entertaining show and it's pretty bad. I love this show. I can't stop thinking about it and I can't stop talking about it. It's like the best show on television and I can't imagine ever giving up watching it until the end, even when I'm tired. The best thing I can think about is that it will keep on getting better.|0
"Well , okay , maybe not perfect , but it was pretty close . This movie jumped from crime drama , to sci-fi , to drama , back and forth without much consistency . It's a movie that was a lot better than it had any right to be considering the talent involved . I'm sure there will be those out there ready to give the thumbs down to this movie . However , there are still some very positive things about the film that make it a very interesting thriller . For example :

The premise . It's actually one of the better ones out there ."|0
"I do n't think I have ever seen a better movie parody . Mel Brooks is insane . EVERY time he is on screen . . . he has his own style which is like no one has ever done before. It's as close to the way he would actually do it if he could do it . . . or the way it would have to be to do it and make it believable . . . as we can ever imagine. I did not think ""History of the World: Part I"" could possibly be any more ridiculous . . . but ."|0
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award . It's not often that I'm so happy with a film but I am happy to have this film in the library to watch. A great film that shows how a young man in his 20s is caught in a world of lies and deception. A few days later I found out that this film was made in Italy by a couple of good friends of mine, Marco Santagata and Luca Rizzo. This film is so good I can't believe it was only made for 1 million Euros!|0
"North and South is a miniseries from the ""golden age"" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances--especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story."|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year . It was a truly moving experience . I had only the barest knowledge about the artist’s tragic death , I was surprised that I felt so deeply for this film . This is the life story of the American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat who committed suicide aged 27 and whose work has become an iconic symbol of New York City’s post-modern art movement, the graffiti culture, and the emergence of hip-hop culture. This film follows the trajectory of his life and his art over the course of two years until his death.|0
Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a wonderful central performance from Renée Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fiancé and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him.Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless.|1
"You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a ""story."" At first viewing, it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images."|1
After `` Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman '' with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as good as male wrestlers, many women who have followed in her footsteps have been left out in the cold. It seems that women don't get the respect that they deserve as wrestlers and, while they have been slowly gaining some popularity over the past 20 years or so, they still have a long way to go. In a way, women's wrestling is still in its infancy. But they have come a long way.|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
`` Boy Next Door '' is a hilarious romp through male neurosis . In just over fifteen minutes , the characters in the film come together and then split apart again and again like so many pages from a madcap mystery novel . all the while , we follow the action from the point of view of an audience member who has never met a gay man before but is forced to deal with them after they are thrust into an uncomfortable situation . as the plot unfolds , we watch as the main characters , played by an all-star ensemble , struggle to get through each and every day while dealing with their sexual issues .|0
"Great Movie ! The sound track is awesome ! Very relaxing sound . Elton was ahead of his own time . That's all I have to say . Great Movie ! The sound track is awesome

Great movie! Great Sound Track! My husband and I love the movie and we love the music on the soundtrack!! Reviewer:

Wow! An amazing, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. This film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. As a retelling of the Oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. The chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This film used to be double featured with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is.|1
Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big!|1
My kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with.|1

In the first part of this article, we examine the basic elements of a story-based game. We’ll look at the plot, the characters, the setting, and the overall game mechanics. The second part will delve more into the mechanics of The Cell itself, while the third section will look at how to run a session of The Cell. The Cell: Basic Elements

The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised).|1

As the kidnappers threaten the chauffeur with torture and death , the play is being read .

This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew , a narrative depth superior to most novels , wonderful music , and a story line and pace that will keep you glued to the pages for two and a half months. I recommend this book to all fans of science fiction, and anyone looking for a well-written, non-superheroic tale of survival, friendship and survival. It is a novel about what would happen after a nuclear war. It is an epic that deals with survival, human decency and the human spirit . The characters are wonderful and they have a life of their own .|0
comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.But like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality.|1
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie.|1
A remarkable film , bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much , much younger. The film deals with issues such as death and loneliness, but also with the meaning and purpose of life itself. I have never thought much about such things, so I cannot tell you if this film is a success or not in the end. If you like it, be prepared for some serious reflection and even sadness . The film has quite a bit of black humour , and is not without its light moments.|0
I 'm not the type of person to watch T.V . shows because the acting normally sucks or it 's stupid. I am the kind of person that likes a good drama, like a good comedy and the good comedy shows that I 'll watch have great acting. I 'm not saying the acting is awesome on that show or something because there 's not that great of an acting on most of the T.V shows. The thing about the acting is that in all three shows, I feel like I 've seen these people before, if that makes sense.|0
"*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it,I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her ""true love"" for a soap series character,Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film."|1
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times , this is a hilarious and gleefully subversive film that takes a look at what happens when you have a group of people gathered together for a game that they all want to win. A group of friends who play the game of their dreams (and not their real life) come together to play for the big prize and things go awry very quickly. The main thing that I like in this movie is that we get to see all the characters that the audience would know from the TV show get to say some lines and do some scenes .|0
This show is my absolute favorite . This show is intelligent , entertaining and always full of surprises . Lauren is an amazing actor and singer . I love this show and it is a must see if you don't like reality TV . Great job to all who worked on this show this season . You will be missed on the next one . I really hope I see all of you on the next season . I want to thank my mom and my dad for taking me to see this show . If you love music , you gotta see this show!|0
Brilliant film ! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats only because I saw the original when I was 14 or so. It has got to be seen to believe ! I saw it on cable yesterday and absolutely loved it. I was pleasantly surprised that it was so close to the book. I didn't see that it was a movie. I really didn't think it would be that good, but it really was. Maybe I should have been paying attention to the ads and trailers for this movie!|0
"Strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is hilarious. Notice a lot of the quirky humor. Dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. The art in this is probabley the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950's Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come across something better than the art in ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"", although nothing ever will. This probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd."|1
"It came before ""the ten commandments"" ""land of the Pharaohs"" ""Ben Hur"" and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel ,it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari,whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books ""the secret of the kingdom"" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land)."|1
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage . I saw this when I was looking for a documentary to see if my daughter would like it and she loved it. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for an interesting look at relationships. I loved that it was a true story and was told in the order it happened rather than in some of the other documentaries which start out with an idea of how the family would end up or why they are divorced and go on a little too long about what happened in the past.|0
"I have been a ""huge"" rush fan ever since ""moving pictures"" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why Rush is so popular. They completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. A real example of this is during ""yyz"" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. They really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful ""lust"" that rarely happens anymore."|1
Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and it's among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison.|1
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. You don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. The jokes are quick and unexpected.|1

The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me fairly cold is that I didn't have a clue what he was on about. What is the underlying vision/idea/concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but surely there is more to it, isn't there?|1
Very good `` Precoder '' starring Dick Barthelmess , which in a way , kind of reminded me of Hawks' films. The picture begins , as most of these does , in a little town , somewhere in the Midwest , which has been reduced to utter ruin through war. A family of three , father and mother and their son , have taken refuge there with the hope that they can live in peace , when suddenly the father is shot by the American army , but the son escapes by jumping out of the window of the house into the arms of a passing army truck.|0
"Style over substance . But what a style it is . `` The Cell '' is the internal version of a new model, which will come out on sale a few weeks

After a period of stagnation, the market of electric vehicles is experiencing an extraordinary upsurge. The question is whether this renaissance will last. It will depend, in part, on whether or not the Chinese market will return to its old growth patterns or, on the other hand, will the global market for electric vehicles continue its upward climb? It has just been over two weeks since Elon Musk’s Tesla made its debut in Beijing."|0
"With all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on ""Romeo and Juliet""? Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to them.Yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. Eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it."|1
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford 's work . Mainly because it 's the only one that I can think of off the top of my head that isn 't a 'western' , or even an action-adventure film. The closest to it would be The Quiet Man , which has a very similar structure. I think I would love to see a remake of Wagon Master , and I'd probably love it even more if it was in 3D ! There's so much to like in this film , but I don't know that it 's even the best John Ford 's film .|0
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations, including the Edgar Reitz office.|1
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. To have it totally wash over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is at once forbidding, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies within!|1
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I expected. Instead the director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until I was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave it a very Deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory.|1
"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us..."" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery."|1
"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, passé way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack."|1
The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat , but as the film progresses the interaction dwindles. Spanky and Buckwheat do not talk to one another and when Spanky comes into contact with new characters Buckwheat seems more of an afterthought. Spanky the Great is a series of comedy shorts featuring Spanky, a dimwitted kid, and the world of kids, adults, and other people. It was created by Warner Bros. cartoonist Hal Seeger, who also provided the voices for the title character and a few minor characters. Most of the voices are provided by the cast of the MGM animated series.|0
See No Evil With Kane. The Movie Has a great storyline But it just wasn't a Hide my eye's, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it was going to be from watching the WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw When The Movie First Came To Theaters. I Did ENJOY The Movie Though I Loved The Story It Played Out.GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 It Doesn't Matter If Kane Gets Killed At The EndOr Not They Have Killed Off Other Horror Stars In Every Movie They Have Out And They Still Comeback For More So a part 2 wouldBe Very Interesting.|1
I could n't believe the eye candy from start to finish . Being a fan of movies directed by music video directors I was pretty excited about this one. I will admit I had some reservations at the beginning. I had no idea what they were doing with this movie and I wondered if it could ever live up to the greatness of their other music videos. Well after seeing the movie I can see what the guys were aiming for and this is a great film. It has all the music videos that fans have loved all the way up to now.|0
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her.What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).|1
One of the better made for TV biopics , I just wish it had told us more . I have never seen this film . But the fact that it was made as a TV show and was made by one of the biggest TV networks was a good thing for this film . A lot of this film has been made for TV , and it shows . It has to make sense for people who might not even watch a TV show , because this is how they would see it . There are so many little things , which are so perfect for this film , that it was almost unreal .|0
"An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in Bogotá, you can feel the total meaning of the word ""Bluff""(although is a Colombian film, the title is in presented in English); ! The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who find his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; after this Nicolas is left without girlfriend and without any job."|1
I saw the Messiah:- The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have seen, ever. It was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, I cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop.|1
I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, nor, Richard for that matter, so I must go by how the movie portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I did see and learn of Karen, I felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. I know that I wasn't born until 1965 so I didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music.|1
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V. and came across this film. I don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well, my meeting was pushed back, because I couldn't get out of this film. It had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it.|1
Police officer Dirk Hendricks (Jamie Bartlett) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).A member of the South African Parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist.South African born attorney Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent Mpondo.As well as Steve Sizela, Mpondo's friend who was arrested along with him, and never heard from again.This film is one of the best films to come out about the South African regime of Aparthied, in the past.Everybody should watch it.|1
THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched.|1
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos 's role as Williams for that entire show , was Emmy worthy in my opinion . I hope this is the first and last time I write a letter about him, but I felt his portrayal had a lot to do with the great chemistry on set, and his work on set was impeccable . He would come in on time, and work until the last take. He was always willing to listen to feedback from the producers, and even if there was nothing to change he would say so.|0
"Don't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV just to watch their newest movies. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even till this day when one mentions the song ""Susie Q"" I always remember the movie."|1
Working at a movie theater as a projectionist , I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out . I’ve watched all the Star Wars movies, as many as three a week. I saw Star Wars : The Force Awakens before it was released, and saw it TWICE. I’ve seen the entire original trilogy at least five times. I saw all the Jurassic Park movies in theaters, for free . I was in the right seat when Spielberg released them all on the same day on DVD, and watched them all over again at home.|0
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is.|1
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it. The first time I saw it I was so scared and that was with just the trailer and I was even more scared when I went to see the full movie. This movie will make you cry and it is really emotional when you are watching it. I recommend watching it if you are one of those people who are scared of horror movies or if you have a heart and you love scary movies.|0
The best of everything . Just what is the best of everything ? It is different for everyone but for me it is . It’s easy to explain but hard to define, but I think that if you ask people what it is that they enjoy the most then most of them will give you the answer that you are looking for . That is what I try to do, in my own words , I try to look to see what is good for me and to share that with those who would like to read it .|0
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because I work at a company a lot like IPS, (DHL) and we just love the Teamster plugs!! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur well what can you say? He just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
"""The Honkers"" is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to ""The Honkers"". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's ""Junior Bonner"" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too."|1
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker Clayton, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold.|1
"Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films , In The Company of Men & Your Friends & Neighbors , in which his protagonists are always at the mercy of a hostile universe. In The Shape of Things (2006) and This Is My Family (2009), the focus of his concern is himself, and the universe seems benign. In The Break of Noon, he once again portrays a world that he knows well. But he does so in a novel way. ""In the beginning there was darkness and, with a roar, the darkness exploded into light."|0
I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track will be released, Ilona Sekacz' work is truly enduring. Twenty years on I am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. Somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction? ), Catherine descends on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney.|1
I had always heard about this great mini-series , but viewed it for the first time this week , July 9, 2011. After watching Episode 1, i have to admit i'm impressed by the script, acting , direction , editing and the whole experience of watching the series. I think it's a must see for all . I'd give it a 7/10. The best of the series to date is the Episode 3 , Episode 4 and Episode 3 , all of which are excellent. The rest , well not so much , i'd give a 7.|0
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years , Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema for decades with his unique brand of cinema verite and docufictions. His most famous film is called 'Agua y arena', about the making of 'Nosferatu' in 1979 which has been used as inspiration to a number of people in the last years. Werner Herzog is a fascinating character who has created quite a cult and he has managed to stay relatively unknown throughout his career, with only a limited amount of his work available in English.|0
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's ""Land of the Lost"") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. ; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair."|1
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word.|1
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, ""just right"" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi."|1
"wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a ""monster"" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that Alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like Lauren better!"|1
"There are a few things in life that we ca n't experience more than once and the college experience is a good example of this. We learn how to manage our time, work in a collegiate environment, and become independent as well as more social by participating in clubs, organizations, and student government. Another thing that you'll have the opportunity to experience many times while in college is that you'll probably have to live on campus. There are a variety of things you can do with your college experience, but these are my top ten most fun college things:

"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in Spain on DVD under the name ""Algo Mas Que Amigos"" and you can buy there it is in English and Spanish on the DVD....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't Released to The U.S Market."|1
This is the best movie I have ever seen . It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate . It shows us how we all should be. It is hard to sum up this wonderful film in two sentences. It is a story that shows us what it is like to live in wartime. It also shows us how hard it is for a mother to live in the world she is forced to live in by the people who are running the show. It is so realistic that you can not help but feel it is your own life that is being depicted in the film.|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had its strong points.|1
Finally a true horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I am a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it is quite gory. I am not a big wrestling fan but Kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad I did. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough.|1
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the time . how could that possibly be ? not because it was poorly made , or had a poor script . i mean , who could possibly object to the notion of a young man having a dream girl , and that dream girl being a vampire ? no , it was a matter of taste , a matter of opinions . the critics had spoken . and i had heard their opinions . it's a shame , i thought . and , frankly , i couldn't have been more right .|0
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of ""appointment"" TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a DVR yet)."|1
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make comments about my appearance, I learned to be quick with a pen and quick on my fingers. I could make a lot of money in a hurry, but not as quickly as I could have in my daydreams, which meant that I was not going to get rich. If I hadn’t come to know my limits, I’d be broke now, too. The only thing that’s ever changed for me was my perspective.|0
"I love to see a female protagonist , in this movie her name was Rose . Rose brought out a new type of a female character in the movie. There is one scene in this movie, which I want to mention, it's the part when she has a talk with her mother about the men. The scene goes like this .

"" You know mom , the man I'm going out with tonight, he is a very kind and gentle man . He's been a friend to me from when we were kids. When I told my friends about him , they just laughed."|0
"Unfortunately , I 've never seen the full version of this movie . I did see the 87-minute version twice , and I know some of the events that occur at the movie's climax . And I think you can get that from what I 've written here . I have to admit that as an adult , I 've had a bit of an "" ack "" reaction to this movie . This was a big deal when it first came out . Many parents were afraid their kids would see this film and think that it was okay to do things like this ."|0
Well.....I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVD's yet). Boy....was I surprised!!|1
Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years . Great production design , appealing stars , great dialogue and a great theme song . This movie is for those who are old school , like me , and want to relive their youth . The special effects and costumes in this movie will wow anyone who sees the film . The special effects in this movie are amazing . This movie has it all , great music , great costumes , and great production . This movie will make you laugh and you will not be able to sleep once you hear the song .|0
Gosh , I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again as an older person, it doesn't necessarily mean you have changed in the time that has passed . As a boy, I saw it as a campy adventure ( which it was ) , while as a man , it is a great film and has stood the test of time well . But I have always said this film , like many of his films , would have been better had it been written by a man .|0
"In dramatising Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route."|1
Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall ! As an archivist, I've seen a lot of great films I can't help but share, even when they're not mine. This is one of those. For those that don't know the film is based on the true story of George and Gracie Hart, an American musical-comedy couple who married in the late 1940's, with Gracie singing, George playing drums. The film tells the story of their marriage and early years, as well as how they rose to fame.|0
I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago . I 've seen it 4 times already in my life. And each time I see it I get more and more excited as it approaches closer and closer. I 've heard so many good things about this movie that it 's almost guaranteed that I will watch it yet again this time around. And if you 're thinking about this film then you 're doing it at your own risk . There 's a lot of blood and guts in this movie . and it may get a little violent .|0
This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ``The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly.'' An elderly couple sit in a small train station cafe. A man and a woman come to meet the couple, only to be greeted by the old man. The man and the man's wife then exit the train and head back down the platform. They are joined by two men, one with a gun. Suddenly the man and his wife jump onto the car and start shooting.|0
One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wish it had told us more. I have read many biographies and seen other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control.|1
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably American accent.|1
If you are a fan of early Duke movies , this Lone Star oldie is a good one . What was the movie about ? A wealthy Texan wants to purchase land from a poor Indian . The Indians want their lands back , but they also want some kind of reward for giving it up . When a group of them ride up to meet the rich man , they are stopped at gunpoint , and then the rich man offers to help the Indians find their land , which he thinks is in Colorado . Of course , the rich man is secretly planning to sell the land to the government .|0
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway).The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work.|1
I loved this movie ! OH MY GOSH ! This movie rocked so hard ! I found it amongst some old movies and never watched it again :/ But now I feel like I should have seen it a 100 times more than I did. So glad I found it now ! Love it ! I think I might be a bit weird but just like everything else by this amazing director :/ I love all his movies, I saw a couple of them for the first time years ago and they still have not lost any of their magic !|0
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie."|1
I did n't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn . I do n't know why I keep buying books by authors that I have no interest in whatsoever. But I did make an exception to this rule, and I enjoyed it. The book starts right where the first one left off. And it was an interesting ending, but a sad ending in some respects. And we get a little bit more exposition, a lot of flashbacks, and then we get the next part of the book, which I did n't enjoy as much. I found it a bit hard to connect with.|0
"I loved this movie! OH MY GOSH! This movie rocked so hard! I found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (Which btw, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about. ), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. ""What controversy?"""|1
"""Jaded"" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like ""Indecent Behavior"" or ""Friend Of The Family"". ""Jaded"" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. The raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie."|1
It 's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it 's all over the place, with a plot that makes no sense, a tone that seems to be trying to be multiple genres at once. And yet, there 's an energy that keeps me going through the whole thing; and I can 't help feeling there 's some good stuff here. The cast is a decent mix, and it 's interesting to see them trying their hand at all this stuff.|0
"I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult . To say that is even close to ""good"" is a huge understatement. Even though most of the ""good"" ideas in this were actually pretty stupid, there were also several good ones in there. My favorite is the one at the beginning where they try to figure out how a person's soul moves through their body, and one of them says something like ""well, if I think really hard, can I move my arms?"" The other guy answers ""No""."|0
"It came before `` the ten commandments '' `` land of the Pharaohs '' `` Ben Hur '' and it was there that Moses made a covenant in the presence of Yahweh, Yahweh God of gods, Lord of lords, the God of hosts, the great God of the Universe. Moses was there in the presence of the Most High, in the presence of Almighty, and in the presence of the Holy One. And Yahweh said, ""I have known you. Before the eons were. Before the eons came into being. Before the stars came out of chaos."|0
"I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. Most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. I saw the ""twist"" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie.But what really stood out to me was the direction."|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting.|1
This film had me spellbound this evening . Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted . John Voight is exceptional . He's a true actor who can make a performance work . And it was so good to watch again , now at age 84 , after many years . I love his performance . I don't even like John Wayne but this one was so good I've watched it again, a couple more times. This is a very good film. It is one of the few where you can see Wayne's true acting skills and not just his cowboy-ness.|0
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I had seen parts of the other movies she has been in. This one had a little bit of comedy and it showed how much she enjoyed acting. It took place in the 60's. I thought she had a good acting ability in this movie. If she is going to be in more movies I hope her acting will improve. I found the movie to be interesting and I think anyone who is a fan of Meredith will enjoy it.|0
King of Queens is comic genius . Kevin James , whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny , as we've seen on the show for many , many years. In one scene , Heffernan gets a new haircut , which , if you look closely, is exactly like his older brother , played by Paul Michael Valley . If you have a little time , watch the episode , in which Paul goes to visit the Heffernan brothers and finds his older brother's hair in Doug Heffernan's . I've seen the episode twice already , and it's still hilarious .|0
I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it! !If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.|1
"Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect . Here Alice is a college girl in trouble who finds herself going back in time through a wardrobe into the White Rabbit and the rest of the book is her search for the White Queen and the Red King

Alice in Wonderland was originally written by Lewis Carroll. It was originally published in 1865. It was adapted as a movie by John Huston in 1951 and also by Walt Disney in 1951 and 1953. This book was also used in the first episode, season 1, episode 7 of the television series Wonder Woman."|0
"I lack cable-vision and no longer have ""DirecTV"". So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes but not blonds, I of course not only have ""Barb Wire"", but I have ""Stripperella: The Complete First Season"". I've not yet found ""VIP"" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the ""Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding"" DVD. I have the issues of ""Playboy"" that Pamela Denise Anderson posed in. I could go on. I love Pamela!"|1
How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film ? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and for having a great sense of humour, but this film has EVERYTHING you can want from comedy films and more ! A brilliant cast, brilliant characters, great dialogue, great songs, awesome characters, and some of my favourite moments in any film ! A film that makes the audience feel a bit sick in the stomach, but in the most enjoyable way and you can't help smiling and laughing because it is SO FUNNY !|0
`` L'Auberge Espagnole '' collected the audience wherever it was shown . It gathered audience awards on many film festivals around the world and won the Academy Award (Oscar) as Best Foreign Language film. In 2004 it was ranked as the best film ever made by the IMDB (Internet Movie Database ) . The film, directed by Claude Chabrol was written by the French playwright Jean Gruault. The movie won the César Award for Best French Film . It is widely believed that Truffaut's friendship with the film's leading star, Brigitte Bardot , is the reason for the film's Oscar .|0
I have been a `` huge '' rush fan ever since `` moving pictures '' and this concert is simply amazing . There is nothing like a rush show and this one tops it all . For anyone who thinks rush is not that great because of his voice, you're kidding yourself and you're not listening to this concert and the rest of his concerts . He has the best voice out there and every concert he gives is a treat for anyone listening . He has a fantastic stage presence and he tells stories and jokes that are funny to everybody .|0
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. The costumes are great, the story lines are great, I love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. There is a great balance of good and evil. Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch.|1
If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... Right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... Identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful.|1
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 . Now the daughter is in college and mom is getting older. She is trying to figure out a new career for her mother and daughter. She wants to be a doctor but her daughter is a social worker. What I think the producers did right was they showed Lorelei as a fun, outgoing person. There are some good scenes between the mom and Lorelei. What was wrong was they showed the mom as an annoying person. There are some really annoying moments where the mom is being obnoxious.|0
This if the first movie I 've given a 10 to in years . If there was ever a movie for the masses , it is this one . It has everything you could want in a movie these days . It's action , it's comedy , it's a little romance , it has all the good stuff . The action scenes in this one will knock your socks off ! I could go on all day long with my gushing about how much I love this movie . It's really a great way to spend a movie-watching night with your friends and family .|0
I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field.|1
The entire series , not just The Blue Planet , is nothing short of amazing . The best nature series I have ever seen . If you want to understand life, ecology , the planet and how the planet works , then Blue Planet 2 is the show to watch . The whole concept of the show is brilliant . A small team of researchers are taken out to see the ocean from the surface to the deep ocean and learn all about them . Their job is to go and film all the fascinating things they find . I think you would be absolutely enthralled by this show .|0
This movie has a lot to recommend it. The paintings, the music, and David Hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*.|1
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.Despite incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners.Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him.|1
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be in and I believe it has done well and held up over time. Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd.It may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment.|1
"When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. TV and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the ""benefit"" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem."|1
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more killings and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice.|1
I too saw this movie when it first came out . I was a teenager at the time , and I felt like I was in a parallel universe . It was like I was watching Star Wars for the first time again . I had not seen it before and I was blown away . This time , it was even better than the first one . There is no question . It is a good movie that is fun to watch . I saw it with my kids , and my 11 year old son thought it was a very good movie .|0
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight ( Midnight Cowboy , Coming Home ) has ever made , I believe it's the best film I have ever sat through. The story is based on real events , which makes it more interesting for the audience . There are many twists and turns in it . The story is very well written and the characters well developed . There are so many funny scenes in the film that the audience can't help but laugh . In the film we get to watch a young boy fall in love and get married .|0
First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70's when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home.|1
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be British, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. Not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended.|1
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film 's lead character's name, which literally translates into 'one and all'. This is a film that is not for the faint hearted. The director has stated that he wanted to make a documentary about a subject that was not covered in any depth: the rise, fall and rise again of one of the most notorious gangs in Melbourne's violent underworld. At least two people have died at the hands of 'The Family', and a third is in jail with two other members.|0
I 'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things . However , SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work and I can highly recommend it. The characters are really interesting and the script is well written with some very surprising and interesting twists. It also has great action, great special effects and a great ending. If I'm going to be picky, I did have one slight disappointment with the dialogue. Some of it could've been reworked to give it more impact and emotion. But the story itself is great and I hope this is the start of a long and wonderful series.|0
there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie.|1
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond.|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment . This movie does justice to the whole process, from the time when the Truth and Reconciliation Commission first began its work in 1996, when the Truth and Reconciliation Commission released its report into apartheid, to present day. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission did two things: they documented the truth behind apartheid, and they listened to the stories of those who have suffered because of the Apartheid regime. These people gave their testimonies over the course of six years.|0
"An extremely down-to-earth , well made and acted `` Rodeo '' Western . No gussied up stars needed here as you see them and the rest of the performers . In fact , the best of this movie are the actors who play real people in a real town , a real rodeo and an authentic rodeo arena . There is good music too . A great film to come out of Canada in a long , long time . . . Read More

This is a fantastic Canadian Western with a wonderful cast of local Canadian talent and an authentic rodeo arena."|0
One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as the 'hard boiled' detective. During this period, crime writers and critics, such as Ellery Queen, Raymond Chandler, Dorothy Sayers and even Dashiell Hammett, came to define the hard boiled detective as one who investigates crime while remaining unaffected by it. These hard boiled detectives are often characters who, due to circumstances, circumstances that often include being the target of a criminal himself, become hardened by the world around them and their inability to affect it.|0
"That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera? ""The Best of Everything"" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of ""Valley of the Dolls"". I mean, ""Best"" has everything. Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase? ), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the goings-on."|1
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. If you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.This is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it.|1
Usually , Alan Alda plays characters that are too `` soft '' and overly verbal -- it 's probably how you knew who he was in the first place -- so in that respect this character is pretty different. I had to work hard to make him hard -- to get that character down, but once he got it right he became the person that he was when he first started the show -- the guy who you could not help but feel for. And I felt, as the first person in this show, you have to understand why people do what they do, and why they act the way they do.|0
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War . My aunt actually played in this movie as a little kid with her dad. She and my other sister and I used to spend hours in my grandmother’s attic playing with the props from this movie (which are now up in a museum!). One of my most memorable moments as a child was watching this with my dad in the theater. I remember him being shocked that I didn’t know what the Civi war was about, and after seeing it, I still don’t.|0
This was an excellent show . It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (I believe that is right) was one of the guest. If I could have had more than 30 seconds to respond. I would have thanked everyone for making such good music. Thank you. I would have added that we need more people who can bring to us new music. We need people who are willing to support and help others do more music. There are more people who are willing to help. Just need the help of people to get things going.|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.|1
"Pat Conroy's autobiographical book ""The Water Is Wide"" proves to be something of a Southern ""Up The Down Staircase"", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, ""Conrack"" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. The one actual actress in the bunch (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the ""tough nut"" Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze."|1
Well , I 'm a few days late but what the hell .... ! Anyways , the word that best describes it for me is “Fantastic”. I was a little leary about purchasing this game from Gamefly online because I’m not too familiar with their history, but it was totally worth it. There was no problem with the credit card charge , and the package arrived at my house right on schedule with the game. The game is really a blast, and the graphics are beautiful. My only gripe is that the game can be beat in about 2.5 hrs.|0
I saw the movie in 1972 , and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went into the theater with little expectations. However, the movie made a big impression on me -- and the next time I had a chance to see it again , I took it. I am sure that the movie is a lot better than I remember it being -- I was too young, and hadn't seen many movies. I remember liking it in the theater, but it is even better now on TV -- but it has lost nothing by being seen now -- if anything , it is even better .|0
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows the pace considerably. Billie ""Buckwheat"" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left behind on the riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment."|1
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. I have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk.i saw this right off Disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie.|1
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It ranks right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. Today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances.|1
As a European , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 's. I remember watching it at the time when it came out and it's always stuck with me. It was also the first movie that made me want to see movies outside my own country and in this case to watch them as soon as I got home from the cinema. I remember seeing it when I was about 9 and really enjoyed it, so I thought it'd be a good starting point to see what the rest of the movies that were out in the '80 's are like.|0
"This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. I mean, it is an x-rated musical based on an actual book! There is a real plot to it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? This belongs in an exclusive short-list of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with ""pornographic movies"" these days is that it's all about the ""pornographic"" and not about the ""movie""."|1
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to give a try. The cartoon itself is based on an episode from the 1960s, a show known as ‘The Family Dog Show’ that originally aired on Sunday mornings on CBS. The reason why I am writing about this cartoon and episode of this show is two fold. First, I wanted to share this video with you all because I think it has the potential to be hilarious. Secondly, because I have a feeling that most of you have probably seen the show.|0
I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival . I went in with the assumption that it was going to be another one of the “Twilight Saga” knockoffs, and I was completely wrong. For one, the story is actually more compelling than the ones in the “Twilight” books. Secondly, I found myself liking the movie’s lead characters. And finally, it was the best movie I saw that day! It’s a coming of age story set in the 1970s. The setting was the midwest, as you can tell by all the cornfields.|0
What can I say ? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception. It is so well cast and so touching. You will not be able to watch this series without shedding a few tears I can guarantee. The ending is just so heartbreaking. If you have been watching British drama on the BBC over the past few years, you may be aware that MESSIAH has been running since the first series of MURPHY BROTHERS back in 2008. This series, as its name suggests, is the final one.|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes of the people of the USA toward their government and the attitudes of the citizens of a typical developing nation toward the governments of the developed countries . The United States , in its history , is one of the leading nations in the world , and for all practical purposes , it has been . Its influence and power have spread , through its armed forces , from the sea to the mountains , and even the air . As a consequence , its name has been heard and read throughout the world .|0
Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential.|1
"Ok , maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies . But that 's because it did n't have any ""western"" qualities at all . This is more like the ""mockbusters"" of the '70's . And yes , it was released at the end of the decade and had to be made for the summer movie season . But it is the only cowboy/western spoof/comic of the decade . And I 'm glad it is . . . The movie is a comedy spoof, but the plot is so bad that even when it's not being ironic it's unintentionally humorous."|0
"I got this movie with my BBC ""Jane Austen Collection"" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, ""My only acquaintance...tore my gown."""|1
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona.|1
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns : 'The Gunfighter ' by Henry King , and 'Wagon Master ' by Henry Hathaway , which was an American production based on a novel written by William Boyd. The latter film , directed by Hathaway, won the ' best picture' oscar in 1951 , a distinction it shared with King's film . This was an achievement the western genre in its early years was to enjoy no more and the period of the late 50's , early 60's saw the advent of a new wave that would transform it from a genre to an art form .|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through . It has a great ensemble of characters , a little bit of everything . It has an edge , a little bit of everything , a great story to it all . I have only one or two notes to make about it . I felt like it should have been a bit more developed . I thought that Nurse Betty's love life was somewhat one sided , that is she was going out with the other nurse . I would love to see more of that side of her .|0
"Having just got the ""Loony Tunes Golden Collection""(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.Rabbit Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being ""Rabbit Fire"" and ""Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and Daffy argue about who Elmer Fudd should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!"|1
"In the midst of a documentary about his parents , the filmmaker 's mother dies , but he continues making his movie . soon thereafter , the filmmaker's father dies . this is the simple outline of the plot of david f. nolan's ""the dark knight ."" there are other complications , but this is the central storyline of the film . at least that's how nolan describes his film in interviews . at first glance , one might think that nolan didn't know what his film was all about , but after seeing it , it makes perfect sense ."|0
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney , Australia , following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old schoolgirl, Chloe Sullivan, to smuggle cocaine into the Sydney airport with her best friend in a bid to impress an older man she loves. She has just been kicked out of school and her family is about to disown her as she tries to find the man who she loves before her family finds out. But things are going to get really ugly for her because a drug lord has other plans for Chloe.|0
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) ."|1
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I expected. It was actually a kind of sweet, heartwarming and fun movie about a girl who moves into an old mansion after her parents die and she is suddenly thrust into a weird world and people she barely knows and who don't seem to want her around. I like that there's a happy ending here, but not one where she just gets taken care of and that's it. There are issues to be resolved here too, like what was that thing that happened with the little boy?|0
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album.|1
"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called ""Good"". We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship."|1

"I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has ! It was funny and it showed what is wrong with the government of the UK today. Here is the cartoon I refer to - taken from 'The Times' and it was published on 27th April 1979:

I can't quite work out what they are trying to say... maybe this cartoon sums it up? I agree it was a good cartoon, but I think it's time the cartoon stopped being funny because it's just as bad now (or was even worse in 1979) than it was in the 1980's."|0
I LOVE this movie . and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore . I think they should make a sequel to this movie as a tv show , it is way better than most other Disney shows that have been on tv . I don’t have the energy to write a lot about this movie, but it is something I have enjoyed from the get go. While watching it for the first time with my daughter, she started to cry everytime a song or character was coming on screen and I had to tell her to put in on pause, then stop and give me that look.|0
I 'm seen this documentary in its feature-form , in a movie theatre . And ... wouah ! The pictures were great in that format . You know how they are , with those big , deep soundtracks ... the ones with all the wah wahs and the harmonics and the vibrato ? Well , this one is no different ... and I liked it . The pictures are even better than they sound in this case . But even if they were not , this documentary about the life and music of George Harrison is one of those that can't be missed . So here it is .|0
"Surprising , witty , funny and totally engaging , the film grabs a little-known reality : that of the student-teacher relationship in modern British higher education . unlike many previous studies of the issue , "" a day in the life of a student "" takes a fresh , humorous and provocative look at the real-life challenges facing those in this unique relationship in the university environment . set in an english department , it follows several students as they take their exams and try and get through a typical week of college life . one of these is laurie , played by jonny lee in a brilliant and touching performance ."|0
"Ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! ""Just Before Dawn"" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. It's a hell of a lot of fun.I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. ""Wrong Turn"" ripped this movie off something fierce! There's plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch."|1
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film . It was when I was a teenager , and my mother took us to the movies . As the lights came up, I realized I was sitting in a theater full of strangers , all looking at me. So I sat back and listened. And, I listened. Because, what the hell. It turned out that my mother had put the film on as an extra feature , and we were sitting in the middle of it . And, you know, it was really really good !|0
Strange enough , shorts like this get a 10 . Why ? They are hilarious . This is hilarious . I had seen this movie a million times before , but never knew I was in the presence of such talent until I finally watched it this year , at a friend's movie night . The concept is simple : this guy is a super rich guy who goes out in the desert to test out his new invention : a flying saucer . The only problem is he's going out in a small plane , which he can't find . So he has to fly in his saucer .|0
"when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just an excuse to go to bed and read some books while they were on tv

i love the gilmore girls and it's great when they have episodes that are worth watching

for me, they're a lot of fun to watch. i like them as a comedy, and not as much of an acting showcase as some people like them. i like how each gilmore has a different personality and i think they are all cute in their own way, and they look so different."|0
I must say it was a let down . Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the project. The movie is very well made in many ways. But that doesn't matter. I just want to say this.. I think it would have been better if they had shown some more scenes from the book. To be honest, it seems like a lot of time is spent on her growing up in the house. We should have seen much more from her in her early years in the family. I am not saying that her childhood was unimportant.|0
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings . In Europe there was a law that says all movies that are shown in cinemas should be at least 18 years old. The law was created because kids watch movies all the time with the intention to learn how to behave. I’m sorry for being a bit off topic but that’s how the law works here in my country. Anyway this movie was rated 18 and it’s well worth watching. If you are interested this is the link to the trailer and the official site.|0
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we're given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror.|1
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob.|1
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person 's past ? this was the quote that came to mind for me as the movie was unfolding. quote : we don't know exactly who you were , but we know what you've done, and we'll never stop loving you. and that is who you will always be with us . i can't think of the words that he used, but he said there is someones past that no-one wants to know , but it does define who that person is .|0
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80 's on network T.V . I think I was like 9. I remember I was watching the show and my dad had come home late that night from work. I was at the kitchen table with my sister and another little girl, when I heard my dad talking to my mom outside. Then he walked in the house and went straight to the kitchen table. He then told us to get ready for bed. He then noticed me and my sister were not ready for bed. My sister got ready, but I didn't want to go.|0
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great Actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that sometime that the Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a Car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much.|1
This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks . Marjorie Main ( Ma ) steals the show in the role and is so great that the role was played by her for several years afterward. The rest of the cast is not up to par with Main , which is not surprising given the era in which the film was made. It is entertaining, and I recommend it to you. The story opens with Ma taking an elevator to the office of her stockbroker . She has $25,000 in stock and wants to sell her shares and make money .|0
"After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was damn well worth the wait! ""Rush in Rio"" may very well be the greatest rock DVD in existence. I'm not joking. It's incredible! All the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. I find it makes you feel like you're actually in Rio watching the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're actually there."|1
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years....But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army?|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes of the USA – which is more powerful than every single other country in the world – and the attitude of the USA when it comes to its own citizens. In a world of “everyone for him or herself,” America is about the opposite: “for them, but not for everyone.” And like the title of the film suggests, this theme of self-absorption and privilege is not limited to just a few members of the country’s elite; it permeates the entire country.|0
Robert Altman , Nicolas Roeg , John-Luc Goddard -- you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? Sorry, no. You’ve been warned. Don’t say you weren’t. “Quiet Place” is a film where everything that should’ve made it fun, fun, fun is missing. You’ve seen it coming. You knew “Quiet Place” was about a family who moved from the city to the “country” (they were city people, of course). That it was supposed to be about what happens when a family moved.|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic.|1
Fuckland is an interesting film . I personally love the Dogma movement . I wish it had lasted longer . Its nice to see the same ideas expressed through a different creative medium. The story is interesting, the characters are believable and the visuals are a pleasure to look at . The film is well put together and the acting was good. Its got a good plot , an interesting concept and the visual design is top class. Its a must see for any fans of the genre . For those who haven't seen the film here is a bit of a summary of what happened in it .|0
"""Two Hands"" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local ""Big"" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected."|1
Tex Avery 's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the most prolific periods in the history of animated films. He produced over 400 cartoons during this period, beginning with 'The Egg and I' in 1941, continuing with 'Tom and Jerry', 'Mickey Mouse', 'Donald Duck', 'Popeye', 'Cinderella', and his most famous, 'Bambi', all in the '40s, and including 'The Three Caballeros', 'Casper the Friendly Ghost', 'The Atom Ant Adventure', and 'The Fox and the Hound'.|0
I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old . It was only recently that I came across the film on a late night TV show and got so excited I couldn’t get back to sleep until I watched it. I was so happy it was on TV. It was then that I realized the film was being screened as part of a late night series of classic B films . It was a great thrill to see the film after all that time. This is the film that I would love to watch over and over again again .|0
This small John Ford western with no 'stars ' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces, and a timeless classic. John Wayne is his usual hard-boiled, self-reliant, taciturn, no-nonsense, law-enforcement man, but he also finds time to do a little philosophizing. The film has an interesting plot, a good script, interesting cinematography, and a great score by Victor Young. But what really sets this apart from everything else he did is that there is a good deal of humor injected into the plot.|0
I 've seen 'nurse betty ' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea ' in spain . I think it was called spain in the early 80 's . I'm not sure if the second time was 2001 . I don't know if she's been there in september . It may have been a few years since I've seen it . I don't remember the year . I haven't heard about a film named 'nurse betty ' with september 2000 . There's no september , I'm not sure when the film was made .|0
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom , which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds up to all different kinds of possibilities. When the show went off the air in the 1990s, there weren't any more shows with this concept, and now we see the same thing happen with Glee and The New Normal. I hope we see some new sitcoms with positive messages and concepts soon, so the kids and teens out there can still relate. I can understand the hate towards that show. I don't think there's any way around it.|0
"I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover, and the centerfold, as I recall. She's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and so I kept a look out for her in other stuff. She's in Steven Spielberg's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and Barbara Streisand's ""The Main Event"" and Bill Murray's ""Meatballs"", plus lots of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies."|1
This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he's a fugitive on the run. They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.This was on odd film.

There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story , where both Carpenters are in a recording studio. They are sitting across a table from each other. They are about to begin their final song together as a duo. As you can imagine, it is a very romantic, heartfelt, heartwarming and tender moment between these two. This is the scene that you see in many home movies of the Carpenters as they performed as a duo. It’s a cute, romantic, touching scene between Karen and Dick and that is how I would describe it to you and that is the way to view it.|0

Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie . Is hilarious and it's a great way to see the country. It's also one of the best comedies of the year. The movie is very well made and funny. The main character is a very funny and charming guy, and I think the story would be much better if we could understand the other side of the story. He is not a bad guy at all. We can't know what he will do and we are very confused about that, but at least there is some humor in the story.|0
