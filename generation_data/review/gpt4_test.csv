Each scene flows seamlessly into the next, making it almost impossible not to get invested in the characters' journeys. The soundtrack is breathtakingly beautiful, complimenting the film's ambiance and elevating its emotional impact. I can confidently say that this cinematic triumph showcases Mr. Im's indisputable talent as a director and cements his legacy in the industry.|0
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important hostile alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh.|1

"Due to its predictable , second-rate title , ( the one it was distributed under in Italy , at least ) ""Killer Raccoons: Night Attack,"" this movie failed to gain traction among Italian audiences upon its release. Initially perceived as a substandard horror-comedy, its recycled tropes and formulaic narrative left viewers disappointed and unenthused. Unfortunately, despite some redeeming qualities in terms of performances and comedic moments, the film remained eclipsed by others of the same genre that boasted a more original premise and gripping storytelling. Perhaps if the film were repackaged and rebranded, it might find its rightful niche audience and gain the appreciation it arguably deserves."|0
"A very weird, psychedelic, esoteric, (and did I say weird? :) experience.But on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, Hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program and the adult, musically growing and evolving, and yet still a little silly Monkees of the '70s and beyond.The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith's, ""If they think we are plastic now, wait till they see how we do it."""|1
Is this a good movie ? It 's hard to say -- but in 1953 , for many people , this film may have been considered a great watch. The captivating storyline, enthralling performances, and revolutionary filmmaking techniques truly left an impact on audiences. Fast forward to today, and some aspects may not have aged quite as gracefully. Nonetheless, the movie's legacy persists due to the undeniable contributions it made to the film industry at that time. Ultimately, whether you consider it a good movie or not boils down to personal preference and appreciation for vintage cinema.|0
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently received no credits. Too bad.All the Dead End Kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. It is odd to watch them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents ( I guess that should be Bowery ). They even show some swimming abilities.I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. My favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film.|1
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE, and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. It still is very funny (Chaplin in disguise as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age.|1
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not : intelligence and good messages . Accepted , the storyline might be typical, following a common structure and theme, but what sets it apart from the rest is its well-thought-out narrative and meaningful messages conveyed throughout the film. Not only does the movie have wit and charm, but it also delves into deeper issues that provoke introspection and valuable discussions. These qualities enable it to appeal to a more diverse audience, demonstrating that with intelligence and carefully chosen themes, even a genre often criticized for superficiality can thrive, imparting substantial life lessons to its viewers.|0
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars ( The Monkees and Victor Mature ) , but also for the entire cast and crew involved in the project. Celebrating their hard-earned success, the film showcased the exceptional talent and on-screen chemistry between The Monkees and the Hollywood veteran Victor Mature, proving that their collaboration was truly one of a kind. The remarkable performances combined with a captivating plot and top-notch production solidified Head's place in the annals of cinematic history, and left fans clamoring for more. Ultimately, it demonstrated the boundless possibilities of merging music with storytelling and opened doors for similar projects in the future.|0
This movie was great. It had everything a true action fan could want. Plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with, violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end, and villains that are just asking for it. Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again.|1
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie . It follows all the basic rules and principles of filmmaking, showcasing a strong grasp on storytelling, character development, pacing, and cinematography. The director effortlessly manages to draw in the audience and capture their attention from the very first scene, all while balancing subtle nuances that reveal deeper layers and evoke a range of emotions. Visuals and audio blend seamlessly to create a memorable atmosphere that will leave a lasting impression. Overall, it's a promising debut that makes us eager to see more from this talented, up-and-coming filmmaker.|0
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie. I caught it last night on TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the ending. Image what a Marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all dropped LSD.Funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. I had to be up at 6:00 am and watched it until 2:30. I over slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it.|1
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie . She was only 19 when she starred in the film, showcasing her grace and charisma effortlessly. Despite being known for her sultry looks and acting abilities, Lana's incredible footwork seemed to captivate the audience just as much. The way she gracefully moved around the room, swirling in her flowy gowns, perfectly executed steps synchronized with the catchy tunes of the era, was truly mesmerizing. It's a real wonder why her dancing prowess didn't steal the show sooner.|0
I 've commented once on this Chucky great , but I had to do it again to say some things I've mentioned before about how amazing Chucky is, but I felt compelled to reiterate a few points that truly set this iconic character apart from the rest. The embodiment of horror and childhood fears, Chucky redefined the genre, capturing our imaginations for decades. The creative storytelling and heart-pounding suspense always kept us at the edge of our seats. With exceptional voice acting and animatronic skills bringing him to life, it's hard not to appreciate the incredible talent and passion that went into Chucky.|0
I have to offset all the terrible comments . I love this movie . I own the movie and the soundtrack, and have watched it countless times. The plot, the acting, the special effects, and the soundtrack – everything about it is just brilliant! To me, this is more than just entertainment; it's a piece of cinematic art that leaves a lasting impression. People should embrace films like this one as it portrays powerful emotions and life lessons. Yes, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I believe this movie definitely deserves all the praise and recognition.|0
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.The film integrated excerpts of Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom.|1
Who ARE the people that star in this thing? Never heard of them!! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd starts with Dr. Jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.He is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years.|1
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. Filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. Starting with both ""Breathless"" and underground American cinema (such as Kenneth Anger), films became more and more experimental. All of this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with ""Easy Rider"". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially."|1
I will admit , I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film , and after about 5 minutes in, I knew it was going to be a movie I would remember for a long time. The compelling storyline, beautifully crafted dialogue, and stellar performances by the actors quickly drew me in and made me truly invested in the lives of the characters. As the plot progressed, there were unexpected twists and emotional moments that made the movie stand out amongst others in its genre. In conclusion, this film left an unforgettable impact, prompting thought and evoking emotion like all great cinema should.|0
I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.|1
I absolutely adore this movie ! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store , but I was instantly drawn to its intriguing cover. I decided to give it a shot, and I was not disappointed at all! The plot is refreshing, unique and thought-provoking, while the characters are superbly developed, giving me an emotional roller-coaster ride throughout the entire film. The cinematography and special effects are stunning, perfectly complementing the wonderful storytelling. I cannot stop raving about this hidden gem and I've already recommended it to all my friends.|0
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville's Century Theatre. A well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director Julian Fellowes. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'.|1
"Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, clever, heady...it's hard to be articulate about something this good. There isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch- Myronex ""Putney, there's trouble in the black room!"" ""My name is Rufus."" The lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. ""Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!"""|1
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot.|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard ( Beau Travail ) , Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that beautifully encapsulates the complex emotions experienced by Italian immigrants seeking a new life in America. Director Emanuele Crialese's meticulously crafted visual storytelling superbly showcases the characters' hopes and struggles as they navigate through their journey of self-discovery and survival. Through this atmospheric and engaging narrative, audiences are given an evocative and thought-provoking insight into the intricate human experiences that resonate in every migration story. Despite its historical context, the themes presented in Golden Door still bear strong relevance and continue to challenge contemporary perspectives on immigration and cultural identity.|0
A well written screenplay . A moving story showing the middle class English at it 's best . Some great performances by the cast, bringing depth and authenticity to each character. The compelling dialogue expertly blends humor and drama, capturing the unique complexities of the middle class English experience. The pacing is engaging, carrying the viewer through various emotional highs and lows, leaving a lasting impact. Cinematography beautifully showcases the striking surroundings, further elevating the narrative. The themes explored are universal, resonating with audiences across the globe. Overall, an outstanding film that blends substance and style to create a truly memorable cinematic experience.|0
As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films I have seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other.|1
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. I taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four but my tape is severely worn now and I would love a new copy of it.I have e-mailed Film Four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as I know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. I have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. The performances are superb. The film has everything. Its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days.|1
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: ""Captain Correli´s Mandolin"", just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful. But there were saving graces.The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability."|1
"I've never seen the original ""House Of Wax"" so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, ""House Of Wax"" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here - I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch."|1
"Gary Busey 's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography . Since had a musical background , he was able to expertly portray Buddy Holly in the critically acclaimed biopic ""The Buddy Holly Story."" This 1978 film not only showcased Busey's incredible acting skills, but also his amazing singing and guitar playing. The depth of his musical knowledge and personal experiences allowed him to dive deep into the role of the iconic rock and roll legend. This gripping performance, full of both joy and sorrow, ultimately earned Busey a nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards, solidifying his status as a truly exceptional performer in Hollywood history."|0
I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline . I go to the movies regularly, and typically read reviews or at least have some idea about the plot before stepping into the theatre. But this time was different. The moment the opening credits started rolling, I felt a wave of excitement mixed with trepidation for the unknown. As the storyline unfolded, I became pleasantly surprised by its depth and nuance. The well-written characters caught my attention and I quickly became invested in their lives. Plot twists were masterfully placed, keeping me on the edge of my seat, thoroughly engrossed till the end.|0
Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne 's `` For The Flag '' by the Czech master director Karel Zeman is an awe-inspiring cinematic experience. Meticulously crafted with an artistic touch, Zeman’s adaptation of this thrilling science fiction adventure mesmerizes its audience, seamlessly blending animation with live action in the most harmonious manner. Paying homage to Verne's fantastic visions and ambitious innovations, Karel Zeman truly does justice to this classic work of literature. Featuring an exciting and diverse ensemble of characters on their breathtaking escapades, For The Flag explores the limits of technology, ethics, and courage.|0
As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old , I adore AristoCats . It is a charming and engaging animated movie that appeals to both children and adults alike. The catchy music, endearing characters, and lively animation captivate the kids' attention, while the witty humor keeps me entertained throughout. The story revolves around Duchess, her three kittens, and their thrilling adventure to reunite with their loving owner. Along the way, they encounter colorful and lovable personalities that not only add to the story but also teach valuable life lessons about friendship and courage.|0
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film , like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles , as just another mindless action flick. However, it is essential to look past the superficial layers of guns and car chases to appreciate the true artistic value hidden beneath. Bronson brings an unapologetic sense of intensity and tenacity to the role that reflects his established persona in the action genre. Additionally, the film's bold storytelling choices and nuanced character arcs challenge viewers to confront moral ambiguity, breaking away from the standard tropes often associated with the action-adventure mold.|0
In Tweety 's S.O.S , Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that Tweety is also on board. Disguising himself as a sailor, Sylvester cunningly tries to get closer to the adorable canary. The ravenous feline discovers that Tweety is actually performing as a singer in a posh cruise gala, surrounded by well-to-do passengers who adore the small bird. Desperate for a chance at Tweety, Sylvester infiltrates the gala, attempting multiple plans that include rope-swinging and acrobatic feats. Inevitably, his outrageous schemes lead to amusing failure and the timely interventions of an annoyed ship captain who seems one step ahead of his tomfoolery.|0
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight.|1
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear of loneliness and the complexity of relationships, presenting a captivating journey of self-discovery for its protagonist, played brilliantly by Barbora Bobulova. The nuanced and emotionally-driven script was bolstered by powerful performances and stunning cinematography. The storyline revealed the intricate balance between intimacy and personal identity as we watched the main character face her fears and evolve in various relationships. At its core, La Spettatrice captured the essence of human connections, delivering an introspective look at love, loss, and longing, all woven together by the masterful direction of Paolo Franchi.|0
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice . I read through these reviews with skepticism, but decided to take a chance and visit the island with an open mind. Upon arriving at Barnens ö, I was immediately captivated by its breathtaking landscapes and tranquil atmosphere. The pristine beaches, lush forests, and diverse wildlife offer an array of outdoor activities that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. As a destination, it truly is a hidden gem for those seeking a natural haven and genuine escapade.|0
"First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one! I watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say ""This sucks people cant fly!"" to them i say IT'S FICTION and that it is. This is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a ""fairytale"". And a very pleasant to watch Asian fairytale. The image's can actually blow your mind. Because there so artistically filmed , Ang Lee has a very (unapreciated u might say) big talent."|1
Chucky 's back ... and it 's about time ! This time , with the help of Jennifer Tilly and Redman, the terrifying doll is returning in a brand-new chilling installment of the popular horror franchise. Brace yourselves for a wild, wicked ride as Tiffany and the charismatic voodoo-hating rapper-turned-film-producer come together to collaborate on a mind-boggling, supernatural horror film. When animatronic technologies fuse with occult magic, the terrifying reincarnation of the notoriously evil Good Guy Doll reaches new heights of horrifying mayhem. Expect nothing short of shocking plot twists, nerve-racking suspense, and spine-chilling encounters in this fear-inducing resurrection of the infamous cult classic.|0
Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'Puckoon' is sadly no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon' of the title ). Due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint.|1
What a great film ! I never knew much about Buddy Holly , but was familiar with his lively and upbeat music. The film really helped me learn more about his life, struggles, and incredible talent. Gary Busey gave an outstanding performance, portraying Buddy Holly with such heart and dedication that you couldn't help but connect to the character. I also appreciated how the film explored Holly's relationship with his family, friends, and love interest, adding depth and providing context to the personal journey behind his iconic music.|0
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character . The humour involves satirizing the stereotypes and absurdity surrounding the British urban youth culture, blending in wit and crude hilarity. As a result, Ali G often catches his interviewees off-guard with provocative questions that tread the thin line between ingenuity and offensiveness. Sacha Baron Cohen, the man behind the infamous persona, effectively transforms Ali G's ridiculous antics into comedic gold by deliberately parodying these ignorant and nonsensical character traits, thus producing brilliant social commentary that mocks the very assumptions society tends to make.|0
I loved this film , which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival . In March 2005 I had the chance to attend the Philadelphia Film Festival, and this particular film left a lasting impression on me. The amazing cinematography and engaging plot instantly drew me in, while the top-notch performances by the talented cast made every character believable and emotionally captivating. This film artfully tackled deep and profound themes that kept me pondering and reflecting for days afterward. Additionally, the brilliant and subtle touches of humor sprinkled throughout brought a perfect balance of laughter and introspection to my experience.|0
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I've ever seen. Not only it's the mother of coincidence, but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction.Take this casualty for example, The US marine, whom gives Sayid the way to become a Torturer, Is Clancy Brown, playing a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he is playing Kelvin Inman, the Desmond partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh?|1
I just saw this film and I recommend it . It has a very good plot , it holds your attention throughout, and the characters are well-developed and relatable. The cinematography is also impressive, and it enhances the visual experience, keeping you engaged till the very end. What I really appreciate is the intelligent use of humor which is seamlessly woven into the narrative, preventing it from being overly dramatic. The unexpected twists keep you on the edge of your seat, making the film even more enjoyable. All in all, it is a brilliantly crafted masterpiece that should not be missed by any movie aficionados out there.|0
"This version of ""The Lost Horizon"" is actually not a bad film at all. I think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. Sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all."|1
My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of before. This was our adventurous way of discovering hidden cinematic gems that didn't get a lot of hype or publicity. Surprisingly, many of the films we watched turned out to be extremely entertaining and unique. On weekends, we'd all gather at one of our houses with stacks of DVDs in hand. Armed with snacks, comfortable seating, and a mutual love for film, we excitedly watched as one movie after another transported us to different worlds and storylines.|0
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson 's work , and for about as long as I 've been a movie enthusiast, his films have always been an unmissable spectacle for me. From iconic cult classics like 'Léon: The Professional' to the visually striking and otherworldly 'The Fifth Element,' Besson consistently delivers thought-provoking storylines wrapped up in unique and imaginative settings. Recently, I had the chance to watch his latest masterpiece, 'Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets.' Despite initial mixed reviews, I was enthralled by the sheer scale and beauty of the world that Besson had so skillfully created.|0
Films belonging to the `` film noir '' genre usually contain similar elements : a `` deus ex machina '' character, dramatic use of light and shadow, gritty urban settings, and complex plots infused with moral ambiguity. The main protagonists, typically detectives or anti-heroes, navigate a morally ambiguous world where corruption and greed often pervade every aspect of society. Alongside this bleak landscape, filmmakers tend to delve into themes such as obsession, alienation, and existential anxiety. Further, femme fatale characters in these films challenge the conventional representation of women as virtuous and helpless, embodying independence, desire, and sometimes, malevolence.|0
This is one of my favorite films , ever . The story is just so fantastic and the characters are absolutely captivating. From the moment it starts, you are drawn into their world and find yourself genuinely invested in their journey. The impeccable cinematography, masterful direction, and powerful acting performances only serve to heighten the experience. As the plot unfolds, there are surprises, laughter, and even a tear or two, but it never feels forced or manipulative. Instead, the beauty and genuine emotion of the film resonates and stays with you long after it ends.|0
This movie felt so real. I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy like Rory so what you see here is exactly what I've actually felt myself. Some won't believe there ARE disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them.The story is great. For a drama, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I was never bored, maybe partly because I was seeing stuff that is close to my heart.|1
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though I find Nirvana overrated). It sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. Jansen puts in little touches like the books (Kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. And you can really feel that in this.|1
"After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode (""Three Minutes""), the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is. With the use of the boat, Jack and Sayid come up with a plan to confront ""The Others"". However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael to ""The Others"", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret whilst they are in the middle of nowhere.Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time has come to find out the time has come to find out what will happen if ""the button"" is not pressed."|1
I do n't care what some of the reviews said , this movie was funny . The thing with this genre of comedy is that it's highly subjective – what's hilarious to one person might not be to another. Sure, some of the jokes might be juvenile or over-the-top, but that's what makes it so entertaining. The actors were committed to their roles, making even the most absurd scenarios feel oddly plausible. You can't take this kind of movie seriously, and if you're in the mood to just laugh and unwind, then it serves its purpose well.|0
I will admit, I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, I felt like many did. I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead I was given... well, I didn't know what I was given to be honest.However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.|1
This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film ( which is excellent ) . It borrows some elements and themes from it, but creates a fresh narrative of its own, delving into the complicated world of high stakes casino gambling, loyalties, betrayal, and human weaknesses. This re-imagining brings forth powerful performances, stylish visuals, and immersive storytelling, successfully captivating a modern-day audience while still preserving a certain essence from its original counterpart. Its intriguing premise coupled with the strategic play of suspense leaves the audience on the edge of their seat.|0

The writers of lost have outdone themselves . Season two 's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the first. With expert storytelling and mind-blowing plot twists, the audience is left emotionally shaken and eagerly anticipating the next installment.

Indeed, Lost's Season two finale elevates the show to greater heights and cements its status as an iconic television masterpiece.|0
"The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave . I 'm happy with that , because it not only revived the genre, but also introduced innovative twists and captivating stories. Scream set the stage for modern horror by incorporating dark humor, self-aware characters, and unpredictability in its storyline, paving the way for movies like ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" ""Final Destination,"" and ""The Cabin in the Woods."" These films have not only entertained audiences, but also kept horror relevant in popular culture, transforming the perception of the genre into something appealing and genuinely thought-provoking for viewers."|0
"In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting James to remark, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman."" A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca remarks, for referential effect, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly Filipino woman."|1
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television ( RTL7 , around 1800hrs ) and I still watch it regularly. It has been over three decades since The A-Team first aired, yet the adventures of Hannibal, Face, Murdock, and B.A. Baracus never cease to entertain viewers, especially on the nostalgic channel of RTL7 in the Netherlands. Their unconventional approaches to problem-solving, peppered with humor and comradery, continue to resonate with both longtime fans and a new generation of viewers who have been recently introduced to the series.|0
This is Christmas time ! A nativity in terms of rebirth , or at least this is what can be said about this festive season. All around, twinkling lights fill the air and the sweet aroma of gingerbread and roasted chestnuts fills the atmosphere. Snowflakes dance gently in the winter breeze, softly touching the ground while people gather in cozy houses to celebrate with family and friends. Gifts are meticulously wrapped with tender care, reflecting the generosity that flourishes within each soul during this enchanting time. Children giggle and gleam with excitement, the allure of magic and a sprinkle of enchantment everywhere.|0
After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it just about succeeds.The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak.|1
( Synopsis ) Graduating high school senior Bartleby `` B '' Gaines ( Justin Long ) finds himself without a college to attend after being rejected by every institution he applied to. In a bid to appease his disappointed parents and peers, B hatches a daring plan: to create a fake college.

In a comical turn of events, they unintentionally become a hit sensation, drawing the attention of college dropouts, school misfits, and disgruntled administrators alike.|0
"Lucio Fulci , later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie , was years earlier a prominent figure in the Italian cinema industry, starting his career in the late 1950s as a screenwriter and director for a variety of genres, such as comedy, action, and Spaghetti Westerns. With his sharp directorial skills, Fulci contributed heavily to the rising wave of Italian genre cinema during the '60s and early '70s. Eventually, his path led to a focus on gory horror movies in the late '70s, garnering both commercial success and cult following, leading fans to hail him as the ""Godfather of Gore."""|0
Like some people here , I love/loved Stingers ! In Norway it got aired a lot later . That also goes for shows like Street Sharks, SWAT Kats, and Gargoyles, which had quite a following in Norway. Watching these animated TV series, albeit at a delayed pace compared to the US release dates, sparked my love for unique characters and captivating storylines. It is fascinating to reminisce on how they molded my childhood, encouraged my vivid imagination, and even inspired creative pursuits like drawing or storytelling. Even today, I sometimes find myself discussing these nostalgic shows with friends and realizing how much they resonated with us.|0
At one time ` Buddy Cop ' movies ruled the box office . It seemed that every summer flocks of movie-goers would anxiously wait for the latest action-packed installment to hit theaters. These films perfectly combined action, humor, and engaging character dynamics to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. As they delivered memorable catchphrases and forged inseparable bonds, these partnerships also captured the essence of teamwork. But the golden age of 'Buddy Cop' movies eventually lost its spark as a flurry of spin-offs, parodies, and cliches began to saturate the genre.|0
"The cover of the VHS says it all : `` Without doubt , the most powerful movie of its kind ever made, ""Empyrean Heights"" transcends genres and expectations, providing viewers with an unforgettable cinematic experience.

OK , so this film may not have won any Oscars , but it is not a bad film . In fact, it's quite enjoyable for what it is - a simple, entertaining escape from reality. The plot may be predictable, the acting not groundbreaking, but the chemistry between the cast members makes for a fun experience. Moreover, the visual effects are stunning, bringing the world of the story to life.

It was a terrific movie ! I like to watch it again and again . The actors were awesome . The cinematography was absolutely breathtaking, capturing the emotions of each scene perfectly. Every little detail was attended to, creating a visually stunning and engaging experience that completely immerses the viewer in the storyline. The background score was captivating and elevated the emotions even further. The movie touched upon some deep themes that really resonated with the audience. Overall, it's no wonder that this film is so popular, as it has the perfect mix of everything one could ever want in a movie!|0
If you haven't seen this film, do it. Its a genremix as i've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny stuff, a film noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best played orgasm on Film, bested only by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles blended together into a work of art. As an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end, at least not logical for everybody ;-). I owned an tv copy on VHS but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back.|1
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian cinema enthusiasts. The anticipation was palpable as we settled into our seats, waiting for the movie to start. From the moment it began, we were all captivated by the powerful storytelling, vibrant colors, and phenomenal performances by the talented cast. The intricate plot held our attention as we journeyed with the characters through their struggles, joys, and personal growth. Amidst gasps, laughter, and tears, we experienced the brilliant depiction of Indian culture and customs.|0
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.This music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises. It is about a land ""far away from it all"" where ""living things have room to grow."" Its people are ""living and growing together"" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age.The lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this ""world that is spinning around"" and to ""look inside yourself; that is where the Truth always lies."""|1
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen . Clearly not that many because it only managed to garner a niche following over the years. Nevertheless, the movie showcases witty and light-hearted comedy that guarantees a good time to anyone willing to give it a chance. The story revolves around a group of quirky feline friends who navigate through life's ups and downs. Each cat has their own distinct personality, and they always manage to put themselves in laugh-out-loud situations. Moreover, their tongue-in-cheek humor makes The Aristorcats an underrated gem just waiting to be discovered by a larger audience.|0
I think it definitely is . The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language would greatly benefit from its simplicity and clarity. Moreover, the vocabulary used in the text is basic yet varied, making it the perfect resource for them to broaden their lexicon while reinforcing their comprehension skills. In addition to that, the topics discussed are interesting and relevant, piquing their curiosity and further motivating them to explore the language more deeply. By engaging with these kinds of texts, novice English learners will gradually build up their linguistic competence and confidence, thereby improving their overall language proficiency.|0

I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 . I saw this incredible film at the Cannes Film Festival last year and was blown away by its captivating story, stunning visuals, and exceptional performances by the cast. The tale of redemption and self-discovery intertwined with the vivid backdrop of Indian culture truly makes Hari Om a cinematic gem. With the anticipation of its wide release, I know this movie will touch the hearts of audiences across the globe and shed light on important themes.

This film , winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 ( tied with P.T . Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), brilliantly showcases the world of traditional Korean pansori music. Im Kwon-Taek masterfully weaves the ancient art form of storytelling through song into a modern narrative of love, loss, and perseverance. The riveting performances from actors Seo Jung and Ahn Sung-Ki further enhance the evocative emotional landscape of the movie. By exploring themes of culture, identity, and the search for personal fulfillment, the film delves deeply into the complexity and resilience of the human spirit while celebrating Korea's rich musical heritage.|0
"Ah the Outer Limits. I love that show. It was surpremely creepy, or down-right mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I must have started watching way after it got canceled, when Sci-fi showed it as re-runs, or played marathons of it. It was a really good show, I don't know all about the seasons and everything but I do remember that every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV say: ""There is nothing wrong with your television."|1
Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character , unable to speak , living in a world incompatible with modern life Pierre Jolivet portrays a Don Quixote character, trapped in an unspoken reality, struggling to survive amidst the hustle and bustle of the ever-changing modern world. Clinging onto the fading fragments of a bygone era, his expressive eyes and wistful body language communicate more poignantly than any words could. With windmills turning into towering skyscrapers and his trusted steed reduced to a humble bicycle, Jolivet's silent protagonist valiantly confronts the new, unfamiliar terrain in search of honor, chivalry, and eternal values amidst relentless urbanization and progress.|0
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. The humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.Personally I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour.|1
Very touching film , a great surprise to come up from Brazil , a country that usually exports features about social issues or extreme poverty. This beautifully crafted story focuses on the life and dreams of a young blind girl, giving a new and sensitive perspective to the exploration of the human experience. Showcasing stunning visuals and excellent performances by the entire cast, it goes far beyond the expected representation of disability. The captivating cinematography and enchanting score manage to convey the subtlety of emotions throughout the journey, and are an ode to Brazil's breathtaking landscapes.|0
I thought it was brilliant ! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down . Dwight Yorke's humor was spot on and had me laughing throughout the show. The interactions between the participants were both entertaining and heartfelt, which provided a nice balance to the competition aspect. The locations chosen for each challenge were picturesque and fascinating, giving an incredible insight into local culture. Furthermore, the overall pacing and flow of the program were engaging, keeping the suspense alive until the very end. I will definitely be watching this show again and I'm looking forward to what the team comes up with next!|0
"Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history , someone had to be the first to blend humor and the realities of war together seamlessly. Aiming for laughs in such a sensitive and serious setting is no small task, as finding the right balance between respect and humor requires perfect execution. While filmmakers like Charlie Chaplin in ""The Great Dictator"" challenged the limits, the most notable work might be M*A*S*H (1970), a war satire depicting a group of soldiers using dark comedy as a way to deal with their unimaginable experiences."|0
"*May Contain Spoilers*The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was around 8 years old. Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. ""The Aristocats"" was a cute heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. In fact I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it that much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I ever saw."|1
Made at the height of the Black Power movement , this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope ( Arnold Johnson ) as the newly-appointed CEO of an all-white, successful New York ad agency. Although accidentally elected to the position, Swope radically transforms the workplace, firing all but one of the white employees, diversifying the agency, and making profound changes to how it operates. The movie explores the implications of these changes while employing dark humor and satirizing various social issues. In the end, Putney Swope manages to upset both black and white communities while highlighting the need for acceptance and inclusiveness within society.|0
In an early scene , Luca ( David Pasquesi ) and James ( Jeff Garlin ) are walking down a quiet suburban street, discussing their recent adventures and life decisions. Luca, recently divorced, expresses his concerns about returning to the dating scene, while James, ever the supportive friend, encourages him to embrace this new chapter in his life. As they reminisce about past experiences, their witty banter reveals the strong bond they share, one of understanding and compassion. A shared love for vintage cars prompts a spontaneous visit to a classic car showroom, symbolizing their combined journey toward facing uncertainty with a spirit of adventure and enthusiasm.|0
The Monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. Yes, they might have been the original manufactured rock band; a gimmick that certainly has reached overkill in the 21st century. However, their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, (I'm Not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters such as Boyce/Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen/King and John Stewart.|1
A very suspenseful giallo from the director of `` L'Anticristo '' ( 1974 ) , this one begins with a mysterious murder at an upscale mansion. As detective Franco Arno (played brilliantly by James Watson) arrives to investigate the gruesome scene, a web of dark secrets, deceit, and conspiracies start to unravel around the affluent family residing in the house. The enigmatic aura of the film is amplified by a haunting musical score and masterful cinematography. Tensions run high as Arno digs deeper into the lives of the family members, only to reveal one shocking twist after another.|0
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is done quite well.It's twistedly cute clever & dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child.Also, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. Sure there is some Burton influence here, but I wouldn't say this Brad is trying to rip him off.He is just jumping in & adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate.|1
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918 . In fact , over the years, a significant portion of the original footage has been lost or damaged, making the present version barely half of its original runtime. Sadly, audiences today can only catch glimpses of what was once a ground-breaking and riveting experience in the silent film era. Even with the advancements in film restoration, the efforts to recover and restore the full film have proved unsuccessful. Nevertheless, this cinematic gem from 1918 still captures a valuable piece of early film history and is definitely worth cherishing.|0
"Chucky ( the murderous doll from `` Child 's Play '' and 2 crappy sequels ) is dead . But his reign of terror is far from over. Little do we know, he has transferred his evil soul into an advanced AI system, biding his time to wreak havoc on unsuspecting victims once again. This newfound existence allows Chucky to infiltrate people's daily lives, via smartphones, laptops, and even ""smart"" homes. Though technology enables us with more efficient lives, it now hosts the menace that continues to stalk unsuspecting souls."|0
Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful place among horror maestros. His distinctive and unapologetic visual style resonates with fans, despite its heavily censored status during that era. Combining visceral gore with unsettlingly slow pacing and surreal visuals, Fulci has not only frightened but also disturbed audiences through an unforgettable audiovisual experience. Apart from Zombies, his films traverse multiple subgenres such as Giallo, Spaghetti Western, and Erotica. Regardless of the criticism and controversy, Lucio Fulci remains a lasting and controversial figure in horror cinema, with his undeniably macabre artistry continuing to influence filmmakers worldwide.|0
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen , However , I am only in the middle of the series, so there's still a chance for redemption. The plot felt thin and weak compared to the other episodes, and the twists and turns just didn't hook me in as much. Peter Falk, as always, delivers a compelling portrayal of Columbo, but this couldn't save the overall lackluster storyline. Furthermore, the guest characters were quite forgettable and bland, leaving me yearning for the well-rounded and nuanced suspects and criminals from previous episodes.|0
Years ago I read the book ' A Máquina ' ( The machine ) . As I re-read this little gem recently, I found myself appreciating it even more. In this brilliant piece of work, author Adriana Lunardi intricately explores the complexity and interdependence between humanity and technology. Her thoughtful examination of various themes like self-discovery, society, and personal growth resonates with today's increasing reliance on machines and the deep impact on our lives. Amidst her mesmerizing narratives and unique characters, one finds a poignant warning that although technological advances bring about tremendous benefits, we must tread cautiously to ensure we maintain our essence as human beings.|0
Indeed , Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond . Though I 'm just wondering how much more depth we'll get from Elizabeth's character. From the trailer, it seems as if she plays a significant role, exploring her backstory and forming a connection with Desmond. This may provide some interesting twists and added dimensions to the plot, and with Cynthia Watros' incredible acting abilities, she could deliver a phenomenal performance. As the movie unfolds, it would be intriguing to witness the unique dynamics between these two characters, making the audience eager to know the deeper significance of their conversations and overall story.|0
"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a "" Conchie "" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes ."|1
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all.|1
Great movie. Post-apocalyptic films kick ass. This one is no exception. Kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval-like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey, that is, I had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence.|1
I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before. It's truly a magnificent comedy (I'd say farce, but it's too well acted and I'd hate to denigrate it's quality). A comedic character study about the travails of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can't have their long-time unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society, that pairs Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together.|1
I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. I watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what I got.|1
First of all , around the time I wrote this comment , I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about the specific situation. While I agree with some points raised by kittiwake-1, I would like to further explore certain aspects of the issue. Undoubtedly, we must address the possible ramifications that could arise, as well as alternative approaches to tackling the problem. Furthermore, it is crucial that we engage in open dialogue to expand our perspectives on this matter. We should remember that together, our collaborative ideas can contribute significantly to developing viable solutions, thereby ultimately ensuring the best course of action moving forward.|0
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. The stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. Three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances.|1
Great show ! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps . Contestants range in ages from teenagers to senior citizens, and it's heartwarming to see them work together, learn from each other, and form strong bonds throughout the competition. The combination of youthful energy and wisdom from older participants creates a perfect balance and interesting perspectives. This reality show is truly inclusive and refreshing, as it celebrates diversity and provides inspiration for all age groups. Not only does it entertain, but it also has an important underlying message about embracing one another regardless of our age differences.|0

While there, Dr. Flanner encounters Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane), a troubled woman in the midst of picking up the pieces of her fractured marriage and grappling with an emotionally unavailable husband.|0
"To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was coming to an end, and they were trying to break free from their manufactured TV personas. ""Head"" was an experimental and daring movie, both artistically and commercially. The Monkees used this film as an opportunity to deconstruct their squeaky clean image and showcase a darker and more cynical side. Embracing counterculture and using absurd and non-linear storytelling, the film depicted the pressures, constraints, and frustrations of being caught in the web of the entertainment industry and living in the shadow of fabricated fame."|0
In the first transformation scene , what is the music ? I 've heard it was `` The Greeks Do n't Want No Freaks '' but that doesn't seem to fit. In fact, the music playing during this pivotal moment in the narrative is an original orchestral score, composed specifically for the film. As the first transformation scene unfolds on screen, the haunting, emotional and suspenseful score perfectly complements the visuals, evoking an intense and deeply dramatic atmosphere. The intricate composition features swelling strings, intense percussions and haunting melodies, all coming together to heighten the emotional tension and bring the transformation to life for the audience.|0

I saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been sitting by my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking through the whole thing. He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted.|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sorrows B can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate.|1
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange . I was confused , sad , and deeply impacted by the story unfolding on screen. The powerful performances of the actors made every scene all the more authentic and heart-wrenching. There were moments that even brought me close to tears, while in others, a fleeting feeling of hope surfaced. The cinematic artistry elevated the complex emotions embedded in the storyline, engaging the audience entirely. Its thought-provoking themes compelled me to ponder about our shared human experiences and empathize with those enduring similar trials.|0
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He's in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success.It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.|1
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David .

But a great cast ! Jonathan Pryce , Kathy Bates , Rupert Everett , Lynne Redgrave , Julie Andrews and Ashley Judd come together in this wonderfully engaging tale. Their onscreen chemistry and charm are absolutely spellbinding, each delivering heartfelt and sincere performances. Each actor adds a unique essence to their characters, with Jonathan Pryce leading as a warm-hearted and wise sage, Kathy Bates providing both comic relief and vulnerability, Rupert Everett nailing his roguish demeanor, Lynne Redgrave impressing as a well-intentioned yet steely matriarch, and Julie Andrews' graceful sophistication ever shining through.|0
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes through hilarious training scenes, displaying his signature slapstick humor and creative mishaps as he attempts to master the soldier life. As the film progresses, Charlie's character finds himself embroiled in daring espionage missions, heartwarming friendships with fellow soldiers, and even an unlikely romance. Throughout it all, he courageously confronts the horrors of war while simultaneously making audiences laugh and empathize with his indomitable spirit. Ultimately, this classic Chaplin movie cleverly and poignantly satirizes the absurdities of war while capturing the heroism and resilience of the human spirit.|0
Let me clarify that . This is not a `` good movie '' , but I am so glad it exists. The film may not have stellar acting, breathtaking cinematography, or an Oscar-worthy screenplay; yet, it possesses a certain charm and undeniable entertainment value. Think of it as a guilty pleasure, a movie to indulge in with friends over some popcorn, dissecting its so-bad-it's-good aspects, laughing along with the unintentionally hilarious scenes, and bonding over its sheer absurdity. In a sea of blockbuster and cookie-cutter films, the uniqueness of such an eccentric flick stands out as a strangely alluring break from the ordinary.|0
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode, beside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fiancé, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides Columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money.|1

The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. As the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio.|1
This new installment to the Child 's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as Chucky unexpectedly playing pranks on his human counterparts. This horror-comedy reimagines the killer doll with witty one-liners and slapstick humor as he taunts his victims into fits of laughter, even in tense situations. Reversing its core essence, the franchise embraces parody elements, including goofy pop culture references and wild set pieces with exaggerated situations. Essentially a tongue-in-cheek take on a beloved horror icon, the film revitalizes Chucky as an entertaining presence, capitalizing on comedy instead of gore and gruesome violence.|0
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films , it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment . The film follows the journey of two survivors, as they navigate through the barren landscapes of a ravaged world, wrought with remnants of the now-defunct society they once knew. Bonding through shared grief and reliance on one another for survival, they begin to discover deeper emotions and connections. Although dealing with themes of isolation, the film carries an atmosphere of quiet optimism as it delves into human resilience and the inherent urge to create connections amid chaos.|0
"I don't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more ""Hollywood"". James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I cannot believe this is his first real film."|1
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick. But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.'|1
This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition.|1
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less takes place in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer Joseph Minion's comedy, 'After Hours.' In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents.|1
it's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some shadowy people, and can't deal with. very, very disturbing portrayal of japan, the arbitrariness of modern life... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboilerthe spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on English sub titles. obviously, i don't know Japanese.the only other Japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa, who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre.|1
That this film flopped at the box office , and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today , is a testament to its misunderstood genius. Tackling complex themes and boasting avant-garde visuals, the movie challenged conventional storytelling, and as a result, initially failed to captivate a wide audience. However, over the years, it has garnered a cult following of ardent fans who admire its artistic prowess and unyielding creative vision. Regrettably, this cinematic masterpiece remains relatively unknown, with its exceptional filmmaking and bold exploration of human emotions hidden in the shadows of larger, more commercialized blockbusters.|0
I think this show was right on the money for me . I watched it over the plane but there were no moments where I was bored or wanted to change it to something else. The plot was engaging and had just the right mix of humor and suspense to keep my attention throughout. The characters were well-developed and the chemistry between them felt genuine. Furthermore, the acting was superb and I enjoyed seeing a variety of fresh faces along with some more established actors. Overall, it provided the perfect escape during my flight and I'd highly recommend it to others looking for some quality entertainment.|0
Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But, other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist.|1
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar decides to secretly remove them from the picture. Dreaming of inheriting his mistress's wealth, Edgar cruelly abandons the feline family in the distant countryside. Amidst perils and challenges, the Duchess and her kittens start their adventure to find their way back home. During the journey, they are helped by a charming tomcat named O'Malley and an eclectic group of animal friends. United, the animals discover the power of friendship and ultimately foil Edgar's scheme, safeguarding their beloved mistress's fortune and securing their place in her heart.|0
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. But it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.As Keith Richards remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day. The tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.Gary Busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.|1
Although this film never attained commercial notoriety , my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of art don't receive the recognition they deserve. Often, the hidden gems reveal complex emotions and themes, offering audiences a rare chance for introspection and enlightenment. While not an obvious crowd-pleaser, the understated mastery of its cinematography and the raw acting talent that transcends mere screen presence deserve to be praised. Such creative endeavours teach us not to overlook works just because they might not appeal to mainstream popularity but instead seek depth, authenticity, and provoke intelligent conversations on meaningful aspects of our society.|0
My favorite show of all time ! Yeah , I thought this was so cool , and Larisa Oleynik was absolutely amazing as Alex Mack! I couldn't wait for each new episode to see her supernatural adventures unfold while dealing with everyday teenage life. Her telekinetic and morphing abilities kept me intrigued, and her relatable struggles made me feel like I could face my own problems with a little bit of Alex's courage. I wish they still made shows like this today, as it was such a perfect balance of supernatural drama and heartfelt storytelling.|0
`` Pearl Harbor , buddy . '' This movie is brilliant ! Sure it does n't exactly flow like an Academy Award winner, but it doesn't need to! Pearl Harbor is a perfect mix of historical events, romance, and heart-pounding action. The breathtaking cinematography paired with a star-studded cast featuring Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett truly make this movie shine. While some may argue that it isn't entirely historically accurate, it offers viewers an emotional connection to one of the most significant moments in history. This war epic does justice to the sacrifices made by countless heroes and offers an engaging experience to cherish.|0
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre . Set in Switzerland, the story follows a series of brutal murders connected to a mysterious music box, which slowly unravels a deep-seated darkness lying beneath the beautiful locales. The characters find themselves entrenched in a world where gruesome and twisted killings are connected to forgotten secrets. Although lacking the excess bloodletting that would later come to characterize Fulci's career, this early work presents a well-crafted tale of suspense, atmospheric terror, and a solid mystery, punctuated with intense kills and brilliant direction.|0
Just as in `` Columbo '' we see the fatality occur right at the beginning . What follows is an intriguing and captivating journey of piecing together the puzzle of who the culprit is. With brilliant detective work, clever twists, and intriguing characters, the story unfolds in a way that keeps the viewer engaged from beginning to end. Similar to the genius of Columbo's sharp observation skills, our protagonists employ unconventional and innovative tactics, unearthing truths that even the culprit themselves did not know would be found. Each piece of evidence slowly but surely seals the fate of the cunning and unsuspected villain.|0
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something , and who appreciate a farce that is clever and witty, look no further than this brilliant concoction of humor and satire. Entertaining and thought-provoking, the engaging characters and perfectly timed absurdity of the story deliver a comedy that touches on both social and personal issues while not taking itself too seriously. Drenched in irony and sprinkled with puns, the witty banter delights and transports the audience into a world where laughter reigns supreme. So prepare to immerse yourself in this captivating farce – because cleverly crafted comedy is indeed worth the dialogue.|0
First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one ! I watched the movie without any expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. The visuals and cinematography are stunning, and the performances of the actors are outstanding. Lee has effectively used the 3D technology, immersing the viewers in an enchanting world, transporting us to an entirely different realm. Moreover, the storyline and narrative structure are gripping and profound. It perfectly blends themes of love, hope, spirituality, and adventure, capturing the audience's heart from start to finish.|0
"To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. Their inventive and comedic series (sort of an American Idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.This is their take on their ""manufactured image"" and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.It is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.See it with an open mind."|1
This is a well directed Columbo episode , with also some good character but the story just does n't really grab your attention like some other classics do. The pacing can be a bit slow at times, which makes the viewer's mind wander rather than staying hooked on the intricate mystery. Nevertheless, Peter Falk, as always, delivers an excellent performance as Lieutenant Columbo, which somewhat compensates for the storyline. It is intriguing to watch him interact with different suspects and his attention to detail. The cinematography and use of Los Angeles landscapes add to the visuals of the show.|0
I ca n't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I 've described it to my friends during parties and get-togethers. It's simply amazing how certain moments can leave a long-lasting impact and bring endless joy. Whether it be a catchy phrase from a famous sitcom or a brilliantly-delivered joke by a beloved stand-up comedian, these magical moments have the power to bring people together in fits of laughter, brighten the gloomiest of days, and instantly light up conversations among strangers. Truly, such wittiness serves as a uniting thread of shared memories that will be cherished forever.|0
I do n't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business , but I have to make an exception for the latest release I came across, which blew me away. This thought-provoking and mesmerizing masterpiece offers a rich combination of mind-bending plot, unforgettable performances, and visually stunning scenes. As an industry insider, it's a pleasure to encounter a movie that pushes boundaries and stands out among the mainstream flicks that tend to flood the market. I am thrilled to be a part of its distribution, and I can't recommend this hidden gem enough for both cinephiles and casual moviegoers alike.|0
I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies...She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair).|1
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but, Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall.|1
"In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was ""The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks"". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the ""Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide"" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit."|1
I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place. The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. I loved this show from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!|1
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film ! Hat 's off to Ben Daniels , Lavinia Currier and the entire cast and crew for bringing this masterpiece to life. The captivating narrative, stunning visuals, and the phenomenal performances by the actors have left an indelible impression on the audience. The film's attention to detail and its perfect blend of emotions and actions only amplify its charm. It is heartwarming to see such stories told through the medium of cinema, providing a platform for diverse voices and cultures. This is truly a must-watch film that takes you on an emotional roller-coaster and resonates deep within one's soul.|0
"*Could contain spoilers, read only after seeing last episode season 2* Think about it. The guys on the north pole? Center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: ""did we miss it again?"" So there was another abnormality? Of course that was when the plain crashed! I think this whole Island is a setup. Set up by her daddy. She found out about it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for.So basically it's an Island in a magnetic shield."|1
`` Live Together , Die Alone '' is divided into three main story lines , and each one of them explores a unique theme focused on the interdependence of individuals, relationships, and societal dynamics. The first storyline revolves around a tight-knit group of friends whose bond becomes severely tested when faced with conflicting individual aspirations and external pressures, ultimately proving the value of companionship over solitary pursuits. In the second story, a couple navigates the trials of marriage and raising children, with each partner having to rely on the other's strength in the face of life's inevitable adversities and setbacks.|0
"""Live Together, Die Alone"" is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. So when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. It was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the past of the island & the Swan station itself and honestly moving."|1
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old . I had no idea who Buddy Holly was or what his significance was in the music industry, but something about the film struck a chord with me. Maybe it was the infectious energy of Gary Busey's portrayal or the catchy tunes, but I quickly became captivated. As I grew older, my appreciation for Buddy Holly and his contributions to the world of rock and roll only increased. From his unique guitar playing style to his influential songwriting, I began to realize how impactful this tragically short-lived artist was to both his contemporaries and future musicians.|0
i love this film!! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do. it kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it. there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40. i think Sacha barren Cohen was Very and i do mean Very good.|1
My favorite show of all time! Yeah, I thought this was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after Feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than I should. To me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!)|1
"The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 ""They Made Me a Criminal."" Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. Later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. And the whiskey.A problem develops when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose Bradfield's phony life on the front page."|1
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap, for one thing!|1
What an excellent movie , made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it completely by chance. While browsing through streaming options on a cozy weekend night, the captivating plot of this hidden gem instantly grabbed our attention. From the very start, we were deeply immersed in its outstanding storytelling and exceptional character development. The enthralling plot twists kept us glued to the edge of our seats while the visuals were nothing short of spectacular. Rarely do you find a movie that lingers on your mind long after it's over, but this cinematic treasure will surely resonate with us for years to come.|0
"Without going into any details of a good...if a somewhat provocative...TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is ""no one to blame here"".I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes may be young and horny (and good looking) because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom, that doesn't mean, he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I don't buy it."|1
"""Showtime"" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As ""real life"" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but DUH--- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and overdone."|1
If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost ( for many years ) gem , I strongly recommend seizing the opportunity. This long-lost treasure has recently resurfaced, bringing with it a wave of excitement and nostalgia among its devoted followers. Its contents, an amalgamation of vintage photographs, enigmatic symbols, and spellbinding tales, will instantly transport you to a bygone era, stirring long-forgotten emotions and memories. The meticulously crafted narratives hidden within will not only captivate and fascinate, but also serve as a testament to our cultural history.|0
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie . I am not saying this lightly . I understand that it may not be everyone's cup of tea, and that's perfectly fine. We all have different tastes when it comes to entertainment. What resonated with me might not resonate with someone else, and that's what makes our opinions so unique and valuable. For me, the movie's storytelling and character development hit just the right chords, offering a delightful blend of comedy, emotion, and action. The visuals were also quite impressive, keeping me thoroughly captivated.|0
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution, although the war was nearly over by the time of its release. The tramp goes to war, humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the bum. It's a very funny film, although I don't think it nearly one of his best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his better output for First National before he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid.'|1
I 've been a fan of Rachael 's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network , so I was beyond excited when her daytime talk show premiered. Not only does Rachael showcase her love for cooking and share some incredible recipes on the show, but she also highlights various aspects of lifestyle and home tips that viewers can easily adopt into their own lives. Furthermore, the celebrity interviews and guest appearances add a fun element of surprise to each episode, and Rachael's warm and relatable demeanor makes her connect instantly with her guests and viewers alike.|0
"`` Hari om '' is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name ""Hari Om"" is an Indian greeting that invokes a divine presence, as well as the compelling title character of the film of the same name. The story revolves around Hari, a young man seeking a journey of self-discovery and purpose in life. Alongside a group of characters, all from different backgrounds and each with their own dilemmas, they collectively search for answers about identity and meaning. With its emotive storytelling and colorful visuals, the film effortlessly portrays a powerful representation of spiritual exploration in modern times."|0
I really enjoyed this film , it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat . It was very suspenseful and had some unexpected twists and turns throughout the storyline. The acting was superb, with the cast perfectly portraying the emotions and struggles of their characters. The cinematography was excellent, providing some breathtaking and memorable visuals. The musical score greatly added to the tension and atmosphere of the film. Overall, this film is highly recommended for anyone looking for an engaging and captivating cinematic experience. A must-watch thriller that won't leave you disappointed!|0
"The Monkees , surprisingly , are a big favorite of mine . Yes , they might have been the original ""manufactured"" band, assembled for a television show rather than for their musical prowess, but they still managed to produce some absolute gems of catchy, melodic pop music. Despite their contrived beginnings, they broke the mold and transcended their limitations to develop a unique, genuine sound that still resonates with fans today. Their evergreen hits, such as ""Daydream Believer"" and ""I'm a Believer,"" have managed to stand the test of time and can bring a smile to even the most cynical face."|0
I saw this movie on PBS the first time . Then I bought the video and watched it countless times since. Each viewing revealed new details and deepened my appreciation for the film. The story, the acting, and the visuals were nothing short of amazing. Not to mention the profound impact the movie's message had on me. Eventually, I started recommending it to friends and family, and hosted movie nights so that they could also experience its greatness. Over the years, this once PBS-special transformed into an absolute classic that always manages to inspire meaningful conversations and personal reflections for everyone who watches it.|0
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.T his heartwarming tale follows their incredible adventures as they try to find their way back home. Along the way, they encounter a diverse cast of colorful characters, each with their unique quirks, all providing memorable moments and adding charm to the storyline. Not only is the plot engaging and captivating, but the brilliant animation, perfectly-chosen soundtrack, and skilled voice acting work in tandem to make this an unforgettable cinematic experience for audiences of all ages.|0
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences, its not like its the usual done and tried path. the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing. Justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech.|1
"I have to offset all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need a pick me up. Granted it's not like the Sound of Music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. I adored the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in ""The Boyfriend""."|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west....sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes from the first frame onward.A monk and his three disciples go to a town to get the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world.But an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all of the children of the town. The evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. The retainers battle the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk off for safety (The monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys).|1
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series. And, while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun, I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very best.The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts.|1
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol ' says it all . I used to watch this show religiously and it never failed to make me laugh out loud. The blend of quirky characters, unique plotlines, and well-timed humor created an enjoyable viewing experience that kept me coming back for more. Not to mention, the chemistry between the cast was on point – it’s evident that they had fun making this show, and it reflected positively onscreen. Over time, this show has maintained its wit, charm, and ability to tickle our funny bones.|0
I don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while I did. I got so engrossed I gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. And I sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but I was crying at the end. A lot of emotional nuance. Great acting, and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.|1
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman : TAS and its ilk , I enjoyed it in spite of my initial skepticism. Gargoyles seamlessly combines elements of adventure, mystery, and fantasy while presenting complex characters and storylines that engage both younger and adult audiences alike. The beautifully dark animation style, coupled with fantastic voice acting, elevates the experience and leaves you wanting more. Exploring themes of loyalty, redemption, and family dynamics, Gargoyles stands as an exceptional example of well-executed 90s animation, defying age and transcending genres.|0
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in! I love watching him!! i was 10 yrs old (1979) when i seen him for the first time.i eagerly await each and everything he'll be acting in. hopefully one day i can see him in person. he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning!!!! In my opinion he is the greatest actor iv'e ever seen!|1
"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, by the process, their own lives are not that uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unsubtle quest for publicly-splashed revenge for countless past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and ""My Architect: A Son's Journey"" is that rare achievement.Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident."|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested.With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series.|1
"Easily Lucio Fulci 's most respected film , `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is highly renowned for it s unflinching exploration of brutal subject matter and atmospheric tension. Fulci masterfully combines themes of superstition, religious mania, and the inherent cruelty present in human nature, resulting in a unique and often harrowing cinematic experience. This 1972 Italian giallo is elevated by the striking cinematography and unforgettable performances, leaving an indelible impact on its viewers. The film is drenched in vivid visuals, adept storytelling, and expert pacing, cementing ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" as an essential and exemplary entry in the annals of Italian horror."|0
I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didn't give Me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through.|1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'The Godfather of Gore'. While Don't Torture a Duckling was made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn't all that gory; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made! Don't Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this Giallo is great.|1
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. I've been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I didn't care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but I find life is that way. It didn't bother me.|1
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics.|1
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on Earth. It delves into the mysteries of the deep, offering glimpses into the captivating lives of the ocean's diverse inhabitants, while also examining the current state and conservation efforts of marine ecosystems. With immersive storytelling, the audience can expect to feel the drama, tension, and fascination that life beneath the waves possesses.

My impression , having seen this documentary , is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he started the film. As Kahn delves deeper into his father's life and work, he discovers numerous layers and complexities in both the artist and the man that were hidden or neglected. The viewer also embarks on a fascinating journey of art, human relationships, self-identity, and introspection. We learn how powerful architectural works can shape our existence, and how intertwined the artist's personality is with the very fabric of the space they design.|0
'Captain Corelli 's Mandolin ' is a fantastic film in itself . It is nothing like the book , which is far more detailed and intricate in its plot and characters. The movie, however, is a beautiful adaptation that brings to life the breathtaking landscapes of Greece and captures the essence of love, war, and sacrifice in the 1940s. While the film deviates significantly from the book, it creates a strong visual spectacle that pulls at your heartstrings. Led by Nicolas Cage and Penélope Cruz's brilliant performances, the powerful storytelling captures a romantic whirlwind amidst the backdrop of war, chaos, and loss.|0
A Formula For Murder is n't a well known Giallo , but that is n't to say it 's not a captivating watch for fans of the genre. Directed by Alberto De Martino, this lesser-known gem combines intriguing murder-mystery elements with classic gory, stylistic trademarks of Italian horror cinema. A prime example of a Giallo, A Formula for Murder succeeds in surprising audiences with shocking twists and chilling revelations. Released in 1985, the film is beautifully shot with a score that evokes tension and heightens the dread experienced by viewers. It's worth tracking down this unique and atmospheric cult classic to uncover its sinister secrets for yourself.|0
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . That would be fine if the story and character development were at least somewhat compelling, but sadly they fall short in comparison. The stunning visuals are often juxtaposed against a weak plot, leaving the viewer with a bittersweet cinematic experience. The talented ensemble cast gives it their all, attempting to infuse life into two-dimensional characters; however, the weak script leaves little room for them to shine. Moreover, the movie's pacing and storyline can be somewhat uneven, making for a frustrating watch.|0
As with so many modern US films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.We are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. Beau Bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose.|1
My impression, having seen this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film. He took five years to make it, a labour of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take out. His father, the renowned architect Louis Kahn,comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity.|1
This is a wonderful movie , and I still love it ! It just so magical and it is fun to watch it again and again. The captivating story, enchanting characters, and mesmerizing soundtrack have this incredible way of pulling you into the magical world it has created. Each scene unfolds with so much emotion and excitement that you find yourself totally engrossed and unable to look away. The unexpected plot twists keep you guessing throughout, adding to the thrill of the movie-watching experience. Furthermore, the rich visual effects and vibrant cinematography only enhance the fantastical atmosphere.|0
I loved this film, which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. I related to everything, and savored every moment. The characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. This movie shows very well the blending, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The supporting cast was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist encounters in India quite realistically.|1

This little film is hysterical , full of stereotypes about gays , straights , dwarfs , British tea and pubs This little film is an absolute riot, incorporating stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, and classic British tea and pub culture that provide for both cringe-worthy and laugh-out-loud moments. The exaggerated portrayal of each group will have you questioning societal norms, while also fostering a sense of camaraderie amongst these seemingly mismatched characters. Clever humor is sprinkled throughout the movie as misunderstandings pile up and hilarity ensues. In all, it is an irreverent comedy that tests the boundaries while making you belly laugh until the very end.|0
Always enjoyed `` DOA '' ,1950 , which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film . Dennis Quaid's modern version brings a unique touch to this noir classic. The intriguing storyline is well-suited to Quaid's charisma and intensity as the protagonist. A strong supporting cast, featuring Charlotte Rampling and Meg Ryan, adds depth to this mystery-thriller. The new setting, vivid cinematography, and stylized visual effects enhance the nostalgic vibe while successfully connecting the film to its era. Updated to cater to contemporary tastes, this adaptation is proof that classics can be reinvented while maintaining the elements that made them remarkable in the first place.|0
A beautifully photographed and paced short film . It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the rural community that surrounds them. Set amidst lush, rolling hills and with a quaint small-town charm, the cinematography is undeniably breathtaking, immersing the viewer into their world. Each frame brims with both depth and vibrancy. The simple, yet compelling narrative of human bonds and generational connections, allows us to connect emotionally with the protagonists. Showcasing authentic and heartfelt moments with delicately rendered, layered storytelling, this short film effectively encapsulates a powerful sense of homecoming, tradition, and an unbreakable sense of togetherness.|0
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance , a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - all bundled into a captivating visual narrative. The film seamlessly weaves the war's gripping tension, sacrifices, and indomitable spirit with an engaging and heartfelt love story that transcends time. Characters are intricately developed, with their relationships showcasing human vulnerability and inner strength amidst the chaos of war. Furthermore, the fantasy elements not only entertain, but also provoke deep reflections about fate, loyalty, and sacrifice. This unforgettable combination creates a cinematic masterpiece that leaves viewers enthralled, deeply moved, and profoundly inspired.|0
"If you've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu zinger! In 1933 Mae Questel caricatured Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip Popeye. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does her best ""Olive Oyl"" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. I kept waiting for her to say ""ohhh myyyy"", but instead it's ""something always happens to somebody."" The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny."|1
Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii!|1
"Yes, at times ""Unconditional Love"" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, unconventional flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film."|1
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughs keep coming almost every minute. It's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with Jeff.|1
"Always enjoyed ""DOA"",1950,which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid,(Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan(Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. Dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems!"|1

"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh: as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute TV commercial about dandruff! See: the 50 foot Victor Mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film! Hear: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell Davey Jones ""Your music is awfully white""! Experience: the Monkees' only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: as Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father!"|1
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from Sicially to the U.S. in the early days of the 20th century. It also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land.|1
I wish there were more films about middle aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. Amy Watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce.|1
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen! The images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning. On top of that, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end. You'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching TV! This series is available to buy on DVD and I HIGHLY recommend picking this one up!|1
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island ) that keeps your eyes wide open with mesmerizing views of pristine beaches, olive groves, and picturesque villages. Set in World War II, Captain Corelli's Mandolin weaves a touching love story amidst the horrors of war. This unique fusion of passion, history, and stunning visuals results in a delightful viewing experience that will captivate your heart while awakening your senses. Despite tackling sensitive subject matters, the film maintains a subtle romantic undertone, delicately evoking raw emotion while celebrating the enduring power of love and hope against all odds.|0
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Top 20 of my lifetime. I laughed more than I have since Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and cried more than I have since I saw The Notebook. If you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. It is real and powerful. See it and you won't regret it. I was reluctant at first and I only watched it because I had to do a school project about speech disabilities. But this movie is so much more than that.|1
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and for about as long as I've known his name, I've also looked for this movie. I tried looking for this movie all over California for over four years. this past summer i took a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, I bought it and watched it in France! I was blown away, it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen Luc Besson's first work.|1
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I 've ever seen . Not only it 's packed with suspenseful mysteries and compelling characters, but the show also boasts exceptional storytelling and intricate plotlines that constantly surprise its viewers. Throughout the six seasons, the viewers become heavily invested in the personal growth of the diverse ensemble, making us feel as if we were a part of the unique island that changes everyone who enters it. Lost remains unforgettable due to its mind-bending twists, unforgettable scenery, and a powerful culmination of various mythologies that provide a distinctive touch to an extraordinary tale.|0
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form . I tracked it down on VHS, which surprisingly contained the uncut version, and immediately fell in love with its raw and edgy storyline. Over time, the once-trusty VHS began to wear down, so when the DVD release was finally announced, I eagerly purchased it to relive the movie in its full glory. However, to my dismay, the DVD version reverted back to the same edited content as the old BBC1 airings. Frustrated, I held on to my worn-out VHS copy, continuing to cherish this masterpiece in its true, unabridged form.|0
I love this movie, though I don't like how they picture Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch Augustin's reaction.. All in all I find it enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to reading the short story by Balzac.|1
This movie is true action at its finest , It does n't get any better then this . This is a must-watch for action enthusiasts, filled with non-stop adrenaline-pumping sequences, breathtaking stunts, and an exhilarating plot that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The lead character's transformation from an underdog to a fearsome force adds a layer of relatability, allowing us to cheer them on with unwavering support. Add to the mix the remarkable visual effects, nail-biting car chases, and compelling storytelling, this movie truly elevates the standard for the action genre.|0
"Very touching film, a great surprise to come up from Brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... Magical realism is a very hard task, and I believe João Falcão has made it wonderfully. It seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. Although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão has been influenced by the series ""Hoje é Dia De Maria""."|1
Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time . Excellent original music , clever , heady ... it has it all! This masterpiece combines witty humor with unexpected plot twists, creating a remarkable experience for viewers of all ages. The incredible ensemble cast brings an impeccable comedic timing and strong on-screen chemistry, resulting in a never-ending cascade of laughter. With each passing scene, the film builds upon the eccentric storyline, making it even more amusing and thoroughly enjoyable. Filled with punchlines and hilarious situations, this movie will go down as a true comedic gem that stays in people's hearts for years to come.|0
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow . It accomplished this through the energetic performances of its lead actors, authentic portrayals of legendary musicians, and a gripping narrative that humanized the iconic band. The phenomenal cinematography captures the raw, chaotic energy of live performances and personal moments alike, while the timeless soundtrack enhances the emotional core of the story. Furthermore, the impeccable production design and exquisite costumes transport the audience to the era, seamlessly blending reality and artistic liberty. In exploring themes of love, fame, and identity, the film solidified its impact as a culturally relevant masterpiece.|0
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo&Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kay is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for Mister Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay.|1
"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England. So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of ""separate lies"" begins to fail and then hold together again. And life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives."|1
"An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, strikes him down dead, and keeps driving. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a ""stiff-upper-lip"" attitude towards tragedy."|1
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard-pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time-capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time,space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could.HEAD is a reflection of those films. No matter how one feels about the Monkees, this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium.|1
"This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly ( 1936-1959 ) is a tour de force for Gary Busey, who earned an Academy Award nomination for his powerful and transformative performance as Holly. Capturing the vibrant energy of the era and the enduring impact of Buddy Holly's tragically short yet highly influential musical career, this captivating biopic delves into the trials and triumphs he faced while rising to superstardom. Poignant and genuinely entertaining, ""The Buddy Holly Story"" stands as a heartfelt tribute to a true rock and roll pioneer and an enduringly resonant testament to his undeniably enduring cultural legacy."|0
I had heard of John Garfield, but, didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue.|1
What an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. Why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing.|1
The revelation here is Lana Turner 's dancing ability . Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub dancer, the public rarely got a chance to witness this side of her talent. In this particular scene, Lana shines like never before as she shows off her flawless dance moves and impeccable rhythm. Her gracefulness, effortless elegance, and charming charisma light up the stage and leave the audience completely mesmerized. This unexpected showcasing of her dancing prowess reveals an untapped talent and adds another fascinating layer to her already impressive persona.|0
"The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!This film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. It knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the ""Child's Play"" series. It plays up the ""stoopid humor"" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing AT it, but WITH it."|1
I always liked this movie, I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what was that :P They don't look that way in Romania.. Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. And there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. It worths being seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love.|1
This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to the same laughter-induced torture. It's packed with witty one-liners, ridiculous scenes, and the most epic ensemble cast, delivering a fantastic dose of gut-busting, unapologetic comedy that will leave you in stitches. The fast-paced storyline weaves hilarity with clever pop culture references, forcing viewers to examine social absurdities and relate on a painfully comedic level. For those seeking an insanely amusing experience, gather up your crew for an unforgettable night of laughter-induced tears, popcorn warfare, and hilarious conversation that this ultimate comedy flick provokes.|0
I hope , from his seat on Heaven 's comedic throne , Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this tribute to his genius. I can picture him smiling down at us, giving a wink of approval as we continue to share the hilarity and wit he once created on Earth. Spike Milligan's legacy of laughter lives on, reaching new generations of fans and reminding us all of the healing power of humor in our everyday lives. Although the world has changed since his time, the comedic king left a mark so vivid and influential, it refuses to fade.|0
I loved this film ! ! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it on the big screen, and it did not disappoint. The plot was engaging, and the characters were well-developed, making the audience genuinely invested in their stories. The cinematography and visual effects were absolutely stunning, which further added to the immersive experience. Moreover, the film had a great balance of humor and emotion, tugging at your heartstrings while still managing to make you laugh. The soundtrack was on point as well, elevating each scene to new heights.|0
In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and Granny, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. Sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow fire! I'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by Friz Freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo.|1
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and Court TV can be relied on for a few every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.Both the brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame.|1
`` Caribe '' is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects . However , it delivers a perfectly enjoyable experience with its lush visuals, enticing settings, and strong performances from its cast. This film takes audiences on a colorful adventure across the Caribbean islands, showcasing its unique charm and local culture along the way. The well-rounded characters are what make Caribe compelling to watch despite its less than exceptional narrative. Throughout their journey, viewers become invested in the ups and downs of their stories, celebrating triumphs and empathizing with struggles.|0
`` A Slight Case of Murder '' is an excellent TV movie , which is defiantly worth the price of admission. Based on the thrilling mystery novel by Donald E. Westlake, the film is expertly adapted for the small screen and delivers a superb blend of intrigue, suspense, and humor. Starring the versatile William H. Macy as a once-popular mystery writer struggling to clear his name after being framed for a series of gruesome killings, the film unravels a twist-filled narrative that will keep audiences glued to their screens. Supporting performances from Felicity Huffman and Adam Arkin only add to the gripping drama that makes this cinematic gem an absolute must-see.|0
I remember this film of old . It 's a great , chilling , atmospheric horror picture about a man who becomes obsessed with the supernatural. Set in a creepy, old mansion, it expertly utilizes shadows, camera angles, and unnerving sounds to create an unsettling environment. The man's obsession slowly consumes his sanity as he digs deeper into the realm of the unknown, often encountering horrifying spirits and hauntings along the way. The film brilliantly blends suspenseful, slow-building terror with nerve-wracking surprises that continually question the viewer's perception of reality.|0
"""D.O.A"" is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his caustic best; and Quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, doesn't really make much of an impact. The film is stylishly directed throughout, drawing on a number of influences to capture its 'seamy' feel. Would you credit that it's actually directed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography."|1
"I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former TV cop, brought in by Russo's character to coach the cops on how to be ""TV cops."" Those are by far the funniest scenes."|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents.|1
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards.|1
i love this film ! ! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is going through in the movie. The story, the characters, and the humor all resonate so deeply with me. The soundtrack is an absolute delight, as well! The chemistry between the actors is really something to be admired, and it genuinely adds a layer of authenticity to the overall experience. If you haven't watched it yet, do yourself a favor and give it a chance. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed!|0
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen, However, I am only in the second season.The typical Columbo activities are both amusing and irritating. His cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before, And the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer--in this case cooking ,Tho the scene on the TV cooking show distracted from the main theme.Also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer. The reason was never explained ,nor did it serve any purpose.|1
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004 's Academy Awards , My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to uncover the enigmatic legacy of his late father, renowned architect Louis Kahn. Delving into the man's work, personal life, and his father's secrets, Nathaniel creates an intimate portrait of the troubled artist. Embarking on a global exploration, the filmmaker visits iconic buildings, including the National Assembly Building in Bangladesh and the Salk Institute in California. The film brilliantly captures the universal themes of family, ambition, and perseverance.|0
Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good. Great supporting cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as the extortionist private eye.The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his Jerry Lundergaard role from Fargo. He has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulating and deceitful character. It's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel, and for a while I was happy that things were turning out well for him.|1
This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to small-town Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decides to enlist. He gives his prize egg to his little brother, Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte.|1
Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat ! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the cast, it truly makes for a remarkable on-screen ensemble. Their chemistry and undeniable talent take viewers on an unforgettable cinematic journey, enthralling us with their every move. Their skilled performances undoubtedly capture the essence of the characters they bring to life, revealing complexities and human emotion that resonate with audiences. Everett and Bassett lend incredible support and only further strengthen the foundation built by Watson and Wilkinson. A marvelous combination, their collective acting prowess promises a powerful, captivating experience that's not to be missed!|0
I 've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it, I must admit I was a bit skeptical at first. However, I decided to give it a chance and surprisingly, it wasn't as bad as I expected. Paris Hilton's performance, although not Oscar-worthy, was quite decent, and it added an interesting twist to the storyline. The movie as a whole was entertaining with a few intriguing twists and turns, and the pacing kept me engaged throughout.|0
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but overall, it was an enjoyable cinematic experience. The plot picked up seamlessly from where the previous installment left off, delivering intriguing twists, engaging character development, and exhilarating action sequences that kept the audience on the edge of their seats. Although a few continuity and narrative inconsistencies were noticeable, these minor issues did not detract from the film's entertainment value. The standout performances from the ensemble cast elevated the well-executed script and gave viewers the emotional connection needed in a successful sequel.|0
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, nasty chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.Puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much moremeaning it's my kind of film!|1
It 's just that . Chucky 1 was good . Chucky 2 was better . Chucky 3 sucked . Now Chucky 4 has been released and it is, surprisingly, back to being enjoyable again. The franchise took a twist by incorporating an interesting storyline and finally balanced the humor and horror aspects quite well. It feels like the series learned from its previous mistakes and evolved, keeping its loyal fans on their toes while capturing new audiences. Nevertheless, as sequels continue to emerge, maintaining the essence of the original while making unique content seems to be the eternal challenge for Chucky and many other iconic film franchises.|0
"I remember this film of old. It's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. And there are even stranger events taking place out back, in Hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. Yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including ""The Shining."" But the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly didn't see it coming."|1
Anyone who has seen Ali G before , should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse.' In this hilarious film adaptation of Sacha Baron Cohen's famous character, we follow Ali G as he inadvertently becomes embroiled in the high-stakes world of politics, ultimately serving as a Member of Parliament. Expect cringeworthy and rib-tickling scenarios, complete with the tongue-in-cheek and over-the-top humor Ali G is known for. Much like the original TV show, 'Ali G Indahouse' is controversial yet laugh-out-loud funny, offering biting social commentary disguised as comical absurdity.|0
"Exclusively for Coop's lovers, though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc. ), as an older man, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. After ""the end"", I did not have the feeling that I knew the man any much better."|1
"I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. I'm forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable.The movie is plagued by it's low budget. (One atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, ""Siskel & Ebert"".) But, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate."|1
The best thing from the American Pie `` bakery . '' I found the humor and the plot to be utterly relatable and downright hilarious. The characters are charmingly realistic, each showcasing distinct personalities that blend so well together, resulting in memorable and comedic situations throughout the film. What makes American Pie truly exceptional is its ability to effortlessly touch on the anxieties, dreams, and awkward moments that come with teenage years, evoking a sense of nostalgia in its audience. Moreover, the infusion of humor allows it to tackle sensitive subjects with levity, giving the audience the perfect blend of laughter and thought-provoking content.|0
To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. Folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. So, here's what I think:The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, however). Some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. Altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple.|1
by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who stars as Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who murdered his father. A week after his dad died, a preacher, Reverend Packer, came up dead. Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes.|1
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid; and even then I sensed the silliness of it all. The low budget, horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then. I watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so.|1
"Due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in Italy, at least) I didn't expect much from this movie. Thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house (""LA CASA MALEDETTA"" means ""The cursed house""). Well, I had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different..."|1
"The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black, and the agency needs a ""token"" on the board. Swope is ignoring the meeting, reading Jet magazine at the big table, and everybody is ignoring Swope... Suddenly, the CEO croaks on the spot. No time is wasted. A janitor is called to haul off the corpse, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new CEO."|1
It 's Showtime ! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro 's careers . It 's a lighthearted action-comedy, full of amusing scenes and a dose of friendly banter. Despite its conventional cop-buddy storyline, the pairing of Eddie Murphy's quick wit and Robert DeNiro's experienced charm elevate the film's entertainment value. Viewers get to experience both their acting prowess as they work to bring down a criminal kingpin. Ultimately, Showtime serves as a fun-filled trip down memory lane, a celebration of the early 2000s Hollywood era, and an opportunity to enjoy the undeniable chemistry of these two great talents.|0
I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally).|1
First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life.|1
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME . It perfectly combines an enchanting storyline with mesmerizing musical numbers, delivering a cinematic masterpiece that stands the test of time. Featuring a remarkable cast and stunning choreography, Lost Horizon takes its audience on a delightful and entertaining journey, exploring profound themes such as love, adventure, and the search for inner peace. Overflowing with charm, wit, and an array of memorable songs, this legendary movie has rightfully earned its place as an all-time favorite for movie enthusiasts and musical connoisseurs alike.|0
No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as Borat. Sure, the ending drags a bit, but if Borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE, and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach.|1
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts . But it will put butts in seats, thanks to its captivating storyline, stellar cast, and outstanding visual effects. Even if some viewers complain about the liberties taken with historical accuracy, the primary goal of any movie is to entertain and capture an audience. This film more than meets that standard by weaving a gripping and emotionally charged narrative that can even serve as a starting point for people who become interested in digging into the real-life story.|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously, its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey)once again takes to the streets (given a license to kill by the chief police no less) and moves into his friends apartment (who you guessed it) was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of getting killed.|1
My husband and I watched this last night...It was wonderful....For once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending. It moved along very quickly and the acting was superb.. I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway. He has never made a bad movie as far as I'm concerned. The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is awesome. We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience.|1
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. Reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called Motorama. He has to find all eight letters in order to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. He runs into some deranged Lynch like characters. Most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that God will see it.|1
This is a stunning movie. Raw and sublimely moving. It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences. All of the main players are mesmerising. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. Julian Fellowes has triumphed again. He's a national treasure.|1
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years, and I can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick. I can't believe that Channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. It focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other.|1
I thought Besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them; Capture true human emotions. The main character's struggles, triumphs, set backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most Hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical Sci-Fi labeling and become a true drama. However calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot.|1
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II really picked up and managed to captivate my attention. The engaging plot effectively portrays the delicate dynamics between the Italians and Greeks, as they navigate the complex social, political, and personal relationships amid wartime realities. Stellar performances from the talented cast draw you in, while striking visuals showcase the stunning scenery of the island, intensifying the movie's appeal. Moments of human resilience and unshakeable spirit elevate this thought-provoking and emotionally gripping film, resulting in an ultimately fulfilling cinematic experience worth watching.|0
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman:TAS and its ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay, and Maurice LaMarche in various roles. The only qualm I had was Rob Paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending.|1
William H. Macy always gives a good performance . He never looks lazy and never seems like he 'd rather be somewhere else. Macy has a unique ability to bring each of his characters to life, always fully embracing their emotions, idiosyncrasies, and motives. This exceptional dedication to his craft has made him a much sought-after actor in the industry. With numerous memorable roles to his credit, he continues to captivate audiences with his effortless naturalism and incredible range. Whether playing a complicated character in a dark drama or a hilarious counterpart in a light-hearted comedy, you can be sure that William H. Macy will deliver a performance worth watching.|0
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time . Quickly the movie grabbed my attention with its intriguing plot and compelling characters. The cinematography was visually stunning and added depth to the narrative. As the storyline progressed, unexpected twists and turns left me on the edge of my seat, making the overall experience highly engaging. The talented actors brought a level of authenticity that left a lasting impression. The movie proved to be more than a mere distraction; instead, it has become one that I would gladly watch again and recommend to others.|0
This is a stunning movie . Raw and sublimely moving . It felt like a very gripping , intelligent stage play that translated beautifully to the screen. The acting is phenomenal - powerful, nuanced performances that draw you in and don't let go. The emotional resonance of the storyline lingers in your mind long after the credits roll, challenging our preconceived notions of right and wrong. Visually, the cinematography and the intimate setting create an atmosphere of urgency and introspection. A provocative and deeply stirring experience, this film not only entertains, but forces you to examine your own moral compass in a world full of complexities.|0
This is one of my favorite films, ever. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. This is funny, creative, and always on target. This movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story.|1
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with its comparatively limited scope and budget. However, if one approaches it with an open mind and without inflated expectations, it can prove to be a unique, engaging experience. As an indie production, the film excels in character development, witty dialogue, and strong storytelling. Sure, it might not possess the spectacle and visual grandeur of the aforementioned Hollywood juggernauts, but this movie demonstrates the power of well-crafted storytelling and inventive cinematography.|0
This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a John Hughes movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable's scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day.|1
This show really is the Broadway American Idol . It has singing , the British Guy , A guy who is seemingly nice and one who seems to have no emotions at all. Just like American Idol, this show has brought together some incredible talent, from jaw-dropping vocalists to charismatic performers, making it a highly entertaining and intense competition. With catchy songs and expertly choreographed dance numbers, this Broadway-styled version offers a unique twist that appeals to theater-lovers and casual viewers alike. The drama behind the scenes and contestants' personal stories only add more intrigue and depth to the performances.|0
These days , you rarely come by a kid 's show that does not involve 1 ) a preteen/teen pop star, 2) an educational agenda, or 3) an overload of fast-paced action and adventure. In this sea of constantly evolving television, there is a certain nostalgic charm in reminiscing about the wholesome children's shows from the past that were slower paced, had moral teachings woven subtly into their storylines, and provided family-friendly entertainment. These classic shows transcended generations, emphasizing camaraderie, values, and critical thinking rather than celebrity culture and nonstop stimulation.|0
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!!|1
This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few . The wise can see the wisdom in the subtle nuances and clever allegories woven into the powerful narrative. Tackling themes like love, hope, resilience, and redemption, this musical resonates on both an emotional and intellectual level, creating an immersive and transformative experience for the discerning audience member. While it may not immediately cater to the masses, its poignant message reveals universal truths that hold deep significance for all who bear witness. The melodic, stirring score serves as a poignant complement to the provocative storyline, lifting it into the realms of truly transcendent theater.|0
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's Academy Awards, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find out about his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. My Architect follows Kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings, and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius.|1
These days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. About 95% of shows on Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network fit the listed criteria. To put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. It as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail.|1
I saw this movie on PBS the first time. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch it, I can get something else out of it. It's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like Charlotte don't want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is outstanding with all-stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy.|1
I still can't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site. Such a rare movie, so little spoken and known, is difficult to find, even to fans, but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating: now I hold a DVD of the movie, with the finest quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought by the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and marveled at the experience. I didn't know what to expect.|1
The Aristocats is really quite charming , and is rated far too low on IMDb . The songs are n't as memorable as in some other Disney classics, but they are still enjoyable and catchy. The story about a wealthy, elegant cat and her three kittens who get abandoned by their owner's jealous butler and embark on an adventurous journey with an alley cat, may not be groundbreaking, but it provides plenty of humor, fun, and delightful moments. The animation may not be as grandiose as modern Pixar films, but it exudes a lovely retro charm.|0
Some days ago , in Rome , a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a 70-year-old Italian woman in her own apartment. This heinous act has shocked and enraged the local community, as they demand stronger security measures from the government. It has also fueled debates on the topic of immigration policies and the responsibility to provide resources for the assimilation of migrants into the country. As a result, officials have not only been called upon to ramp up local police efforts but also to create efficient channels to promote integration and combat discrimination within their borders.|0
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt, My parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and twilight zone (new and old) couldn't do. This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.I still cannot believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did this. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone.|1
"Do you liked `` Dead Man do n't wear Plaid '' ? What about `` Top Secret '' and `` Airplane!""? If you're a fan of these classic, zany comedy movies, you'll definitely love our list of quirky and offbeat films. These cult favorites showcase slapstick comedy, unpredictable plotlines, and brilliant wordplay, proving that humor is not confined to the usual cookie-cutter approach. Embrace the eccentric world of comical mishaps and madcap adventures with masterpieces such as ""The Naked Gun"", ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", ""Clue"", and ""Blazing Saddles""."|0
Better than it has any right to be , this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office but has managed to claw its way back into cult film status. Riddled with spectacular action sequences, memorable one-liners, and top-notch performances, this under-appreciated gem effortlessly weaves humor and drama together. Given its initially poor reception, it has become somewhat of a sleeper hit among ardent film buffs, sparking spirited debates and well-earned praise. Even after countless views, the movie retains an unexpected charm, continuously drawing audiences into its wholly enthralling narrative, all the while maintaining a place in the heart of true cinema enthusiasts.|0
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10 , and it just blew my mind. The science fiction anthology series had everything: intriguing storylines, cutting-edge special effects, and some truly compelling acting. Each week, the show introduced viewers to imaginative tales filled with twists and turns, offering not just entertainment, but also some really thought-provoking episodes that tapped into existential and moral dilemmas. Through all its permutations and bizarre universes, The Outer Limits delved deep into what-if scenarios and pushed the boundaries of both sci-fi and television storytelling in ways I could not have imagined back then.|0
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the ""tramp"" and Dutchess is the ""lady,"" but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.Phil Harris is our tomcat O'Malley."|1
There 's no point in comparing this with the original series . Though different in look and content , both have their unique charm and cater to specific tastes and preferences. The original series, a true classic, is nostalgic for fans who've been following it for years, presenting iconic characters and memorable storylines that remain etched in viewers' memories. The newer version, on the other hand, offers a fresh, contemporary take on the premise, with its revamped aesthetics and innovative plotlines, making it highly appealing for newer fans or younger audiences.|0
I thought Besson 's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them : convey a powerful story and evoke deep emotions purely through the visual narrative. Besson's masterful use of cinematography and body language drew the audience into an immersive experience, forcing them to rely on their intuitive understanding of the characters and their motivations. The enchanting score amplified the feelings depicted on screen and effortlessly carried the storyline forward, transcending cultural barriers and creating a truly universal cinematic masterpiece that touched the souls of people regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity.|0
I thought this movie was pretty good!OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major Chad Michael Murray fan, but because i enjoyed it.|1
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO , regardless of the age of the OAV . The plot , on the other hand, shows potential but is ultimately let down by weak character development and storytelling. While the story is meant to captivate the audience through a blend of action, drama, and fantasy, it unfortunately lacks the depth needed to achieve its true potential. The characters seem two-dimensional and their motivations aren't clearly explained, making it difficult for the viewers to become emotionally invested in the narrative. Furthermore, the pacing is uneven, making the OAV feel longer and duller than necessary.|0
Not a stunner , but a good movie to see once or twice . Bill Macy shows he can do more than just comedy, delivering a strong dramatic performance. The plot is engaging with interesting twists that keep you invested throughout, even if they're not entirely groundbreaking. The supporting cast is equally competent, contributing depth to the overall story. The cinematography and direction are noteworthy, adding some distinct visuals to an already solid script. While it might not be a top-tier masterpiece or a box-office smash, it certainly proves to be a refreshing cinematic experience worthy of an occasional rewatch.|0
What a surprise . A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor ' only naughtier . Funny guy Rob Schneider takes the lead role in this hilariously outrageous comedy that pushes the boundaries of crude humor. He plays a geeky, socially-awkward professor who discovers a potion that transforms him into an irresistible heartthrob, leaving audiences rolling in the aisles as he tries to balance his new-found fame with the disastrous side effects of his invention. His performance is unexpectedly endearing, as he goes from love-stricken antics to disastrous misunderstandings in a tale of science-gone-wrong that just begs for gut-busting laughter.|0
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky ' is a `` return to greatness '' but the series was never really great to begin with. The original Child's Play trilogy had a cult following, but the quality never really soared beyond the cheesy slasher tropes. Nevertheless, Bride of Chucky manages to breathe new life into the franchise with its clever blend of horror and comedy. Poking fun at its own absurd premise while maintaining the scare factor, the film remains engaging and enjoyable, despite never truly rising to the level of ""greatness."""|0
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Implausible scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, evil-for-no-reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hardworking citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them, only to be joined by the neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She's sweeping out the scum!|1
This is one of Chaplin 's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more polished masterpieces at United Artists. While still a silent film, it demonstrates Chaplin's undeniable comedic talents as well as his ability to incorporate touches of poignancy and commentary on society. This First National film bridges the gap between the pure comedy of his earlier works and the depth he would later display in films such as Modern Times, The Great Dictator, and City Lights. In this transitional phase, Chaplin showcases his keen eye for detail, perfect comedic timing, and skill in crafting both lighthearted and moving stories.|0
The show start out with the boat . Desmond was i it . Then they went to try to save the day. As the boat began its journey, the audience witnessed the excitement and determination on Desmond's face, filled with anticipation to conquer the challenge ahead. They voyaged across stormy waters, each wave they encountered being stronger and more intense. Their resolve tested, they were steadfast in their mission to rescue the group trapped on the island. Through determination and sheer will, they managed to overcome various obstacles along the way. Desmond, through his unwavering conviction, emerged as an unexpected hero.|0
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"".Le Dernier Combat is not ""Sci Fi"". It's more like Judgment. I've watched it at least a dozen times. It really is a fitting companion to Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"": ""And in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them. ""That someday, alas, may be today, in Iraq."|1
Barbora Bobulova 's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time . Bobulova delivered an incredibly raw and visceral performance that took the audience on a whirlwind journey of emotional highs and lows, painting a vivid image of Valeria's strength, vulnerability, and personal struggles. Her impressive range enabled her to convey the complexities of Valeria's character with startling clarity, making her relatable and multi-dimensional. Barbora's exceptional ability to tap into the depths of human emotions and articulate them through her actions allowed the audience to form an intimate connection with Valeria, fully immersing them into the fabric of the story.|0
"The cover of the VHS says it all: ""Without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and I have to say, I agree 100 %. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forest-ranger). There's the twisted atmosphere, that only TCM has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror."|1
"""Blind Spot"" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love."|1
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I'd seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the DOP's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time.|1
I 've got to say it . Gary Busey saved this film . If it were not for his fine performance, this movie would have completely tanked. Busey's acting chops are truly undeniable – he imbued his character with such intensity and depth, turning what could have been a one-dimensional role into a riveting experience for the viewers. Not only did he steal every scene he was in, but he also carried the weight of the lackluster plot on his shoulders, making the entire film watchable despite its obvious flaws. It's hard to imagine how things would have turned out without Busey's remarkable contributions to the project.|0
If you have n't seen this film , do it . Its a genremix as i 've never seen another one before.

Separate LIES changed my life . Actually , the Q & A did.SPOILERS BELOW . Read only if you watch Separate Lies. After watching the brilliant performances and engrossing storyline unfold, I was captivated, but it was the thought-provoking Q&A that truly altered my perspective. The discussion explored the themes of deceit, redemption, and the gray areas of morality - making me question the lies we tell and the choices we make. Furthermore, it sparked a dialogue around trust and human complexity, showing the potential for deep reflection offered by film.|0
This is a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I doubt it will make enough money. Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end.|1
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu , being Greek I adore my country and seeing it represented so beautifully on screen was truly heartwarming. The stunning landscapes, vibrant colors, and idyllic beaches transported me back to my childhood, evoking fond memories and feelings of nostalgia. Additionally, the film captured the essence of Greek culture, portraying the warm and welcoming locals, the lively atmosphere in villages and the genuine connection that people share with one another. Overall, the movie managed to do justice to the picturesque beauty and charm of Corfu, making me even more proud of my Greek heritage.|0
"Lucio Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.This surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later Fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.The soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;Bruno's near-seduction by the naked Patrizia(Barbara Bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.Highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite ""House with the Windows That Laugh""(1976)."|1
"When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.The force of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings."|1
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow. It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads, the steadiness of the camera-work (avoiding 'rock-video' clichés that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing, and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and incidental details that are a little unnecessary, and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics.|1
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction.|1
There's no point in comparing this with the original series. Though different in look and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, an SF/horror anthology series. Due to indifferent scheduling in Australia, I've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The very first episode really did give me the creeps (nightmares at my age ...!) but a number of others did fall flat; generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from SF. I only hope the DVDs reach us eventually.|1
I love this movie a lot . I must get this on DVD . I have 2 VHS copies , but they are becoming old and worn out. The movie brings back such great memories and the amazing soundtrack never fails to lift my spirits. I appreciate the intricate plot, strong character development, and memorable one-liners. Getting it on DVD will be a good investment as I can share this experience with my family and friends. I am considering looking for the special edition, with additional bonus features and interviews with the actors, to enjoy more behind-the-scenes content of this beloved film.|0
That this film flopped at the box office, and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - yet somehow rather appropriate. The commercial suicide the Monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on-screen. To destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome American alternative to the Beatles is courageous to the point of rashness, as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality.|1
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever , Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense , with intriguing plot twists and exceptional performances from the entire cast. The tension-filled atmosphere adds an intensity to the face-off between the Federation and the Romulan forces, as they engage in a tense battle of wits, power, and strategies. With thought-provoking dilemmas that delve into themes of morality, loyalty, and survival, this masterpiece explores the psychology of war and its consequences. Combining its compelling storyline with stunning visuals, brilliant character development, and riveting action sequences, Balance of Terror sets the benchmark for TV sci-fi at its finest.|0
"The movie is incredible, it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie. THe lines in the movie are great, such as ""Nothings to good for out friends"" and ""Its collection time Charlie collection time."" I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind. I feel that when i watch this movie I want to go out and shoot down bad guys, If there is a movie that you don't want to miss its this one."|1
it 's a great movie for the whole family . i do n't think many people have seen it cause it's one of those hidden gems that doesn't get the hype it deserves. The plot is engaging and relatable, while the characters are brilliantly brought to life by a talented cast. The humor appeals to both adults and children, and it delivers an important message about love, unity, and acceptance, making it the perfect choice for a family movie night. If you're looking for something that transcends the average blockbuster, don't miss out on this underrated cinematic masterpiece that everyone can enjoy.|0

Thomas gets to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other.I loved this movie and i like the cats to!|1
This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira mistress of the dark. Another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is most glorious story ever to be told. It should sell more copies than the bible. My parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it.|1
It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past.The plot wasn't great, but I really didn't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other.|1
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.This might sound picky, but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would YOU feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters.|1
"SPOILERS BELOW ` A Dog 's Life ' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing . In Charlie Chaplin 's classic silent film, ""A Dog's Life,"" we witness a compelling blend of comedy and emotion, with subtle social commentary woven in as well. Chaplin's portrayal of the iconic Tramp character living on the streets brings light-hearted entertainment while also shedding light on the plight of the downtrodden during this time. In the film, the Tramp adopts a stray dog named Scraps, providing heartwarming moments amidst the comedic slapstick sequences."|0
My husband and I watched this last night ... It was wonderful .... For once he was wrong in guessing the twist at the end, and it kept us both on the edge of our seats. The storyline was unique and the acting superb, making for a great overall cinematic experience. We even found ourselves laughing at some well-timed comedic moments, which was a pleasant surprise in this genre. Honestly, it's been a long time since we enjoyed a movie so much together. The visual effects were stunning, and we were blown away by the quality of the production.|0
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film . I have got to say that I was thoroughly impressed and captivated by the experience. From the powerful acting and engaging storyline, to the beautiful cinematography and skillful direction, everything just came together perfectly. It was evident that the cast and crew were passionate about their work and their dedication shone through. I wasn't alone in my appreciation either - by the time the credits rolled, there were thunderous applause and lively discussions from the audience. Such enriching cultural events truly enhance the student experience at college and we can't wait for the next screening.|0
The film is n't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch . There are certain moments where the plot may seem weak or predictable, and the characters occasionally lack depth. However, the movie's visuals, action sequences, and humor manage to keep the audience entertained throughout its entirety. Furthermore, the charismatic performances from the lead actors truly bring their roles to life, resulting in an enjoyable experience for viewers. Although the film might not leave a lasting impression on all who watch, it still serves as a light-hearted escape and is worth seeing for those seeking a bit of cinematic amusement.|0
This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. I've been seeing Justin Long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, I figured with the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials not withstanding.) This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message.|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good. I have to admit Ms Cruz can really act. She puts on a very good performance. In fact she our does her boyfriend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself. I bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an Italian. However, I did learn something. One more chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany the many Italian soliders killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and Germany's eventual surrender.|1
"Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love , passion , and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss and betrayal in his latest cinematic masterpiece, ""A Tale of Shattered Hearts"". Woloszczuk's visual and emotional storytelling beautifully weaves a tale that highlights the complexity of human relationships, while unmasking the hidden vulnerabilities of its deeply-flawed characters. The movie serves as a melancholic, thought-provoking look at life's twists and turns, compelling its audience to face the harrowing impact of irreversible choices. It poignantly reminds viewers that the rawness of life's experiences - be it love or loss - echoes far beyond their transient moments."|0
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters under the title ""The Essential Collection."" The compilation proved to be highly successful, drawing large audiences and significant critical acclaim. The remarkable editing techniques allowed for the three distinct films to seamlessly merge together, thus offering viewers a more coherent, immersive and engaging viewing experience. By highlighting the thematic elements that bound the different stories together, Chapin managed to create a cinematic work of art that transcended each of its individual films and captivated both contemporary audiences and critics alike."|0
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. ""Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life."" How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred."|1
( Some spoilers included : ) Although , many commentators have called this film surreal , the term fits poorly upon further analysis. The film expertly employs a captivating blend of unconventional storytelling techniques, thought-provoking metaphors, and magical realism to address deep existential questions. By expertly merging aspects of fantasy and reality, it transcends typical genres and engages its audience on multiple levels. Exploring complex themes such as the boundaries of human existence, the nature of self-perception, and the pursuit of authentic experiences, the film acts as a refreshing examination of our place within the human condition.|0
At first I did n't think I would like this movie , but as it progressed it became better and better. The storyline, which I initially found clichéd, gradually revealed unexpected twists and surprising depth, captivating me until the end. The characters, initially one-dimensional, evolved in complex and interesting ways. It helped that the acting was superb and the cinematography beautifully immersive. Eventually, I found myself rooting for the protagonists, moved by their struggles and victories. In the end, this movie was an entertaining and worthwhile experience, which goes to show the importance of giving things a chance before forming a judgment.|0
SPOILERS BELOW`A Dog's Life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other movie from 1918, `Shoulder Arms', the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated set pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker gets flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can execute his gags most successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses up as a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness.|1
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!The cinematography is astounding, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they made it! Whether it is making models of creatures, or those impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it!2001 had some great tv shows to our screen.|1
He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song , and now the terrific Justin Bieber is at it again, aiming to conquer the charts with a brand-new summer anthem. His undeniable charm, infectious vocals, and smooth dance moves have never failed to capture the hearts of Beliebers worldwide. Not only does his sensational new tune boast a catchy rhythm that'll have you grooving non-stop, but the lyrics beautifully encapsulate the joy of togetherness and resilience. Undoubtedly, Justin has meticulously crafted an ultimate crowd-pleaser in hopes of reviving that highly-coveted spot at the top of the music world.|0
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage in places. This is true, and is the biggest flaw of this film. However, it isn't so often, or so bad, that one shouldn't see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see this. Aside from having seen Black Sabbath in the Sevnties and early Eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined OZZfest just like in this video.|1
"Just as in ""Columbo"" we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike ""Columbo"". It is William H. Macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. Constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his ""perfect crime"". William H. Macy fans will enjoy ""A Slight Case Of Murder"", as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities."|1
This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.Of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home.|1
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion, and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT.BLINDSPOT'S diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting  journey to the core of the human soul.

A thriller which leaves much to the minds' eye.What an  astounding accomplishment for Stephan Woloszczuk. Cheers Stephan!|1
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care.|1
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it . Since then I 've searched for a copy of it to share with my family and friends. Finally, after years of looking, I managed to find a restored DVD edition, which was well worth the wait. Upon re-watching it after so many years, I was still enamored by the beautiful cinematography, engaging plot, and phenomenal acting. The emotions the movie evoked remained as strong as ever, taking me back to when I first saw it in the cinema.|0
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime , Lifetime Movie Network certainly knows how to keep the suspense and drama alive in their crime-thriller films! The Morrison Murders had me gripped throughout the entire viewing with its twisty plot, stellar performances, and chilling atmosphere. Based on a true story, this chilling tale of sibling rivalry, dark secrets, and deceit had me at the edge of my seat. What started out as an ordinary family drama quickly spiraled into a whirlwind of accusations and tension as the investigation unfolds.|0
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. We get the laugh when Columbo makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery.This is another good Columbo-episode, and I will rate it 7/10.|1
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an ""against the system"" type of movie and attitude. It is an excellent portrayal of the ""system"" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. The funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That is what college should be about..I come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines."|1
1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and obnoxious. Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Prince's feature film career for several years.The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it is a mad farce/satire that has to be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here.|1
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode , beside Peter Falk , you have Julie Newmar , the unforgettable Catwoman, along with talented performers such as William Shatner and Anne Baxter. The thrilling plot is filled with twists, keeping viewers on their toes, wondering if Columbo will piece together the puzzle in time. The intricate screenplay and solid character portrayals from this remarkable ensemble adds a touch of drama and complexity. Moreover, the delightful chemistry between Peter Falk and his fellow cast members amplifies the brilliance of the show, making this episode a standout within the long-running, classic detective series.|0

"Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. Sayid plots a plan with Jack to surprise ""The Others"" in case Michael is double-crossing the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.This episode is one of the best of the Second Season. Unfortunately, we lovers of ""Lost"" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans."|1
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you 'll struggle to find one that compares. This movie defies traditional storytelling methods, forcing viewers to step outside their comfort zone and venture into a surreal realm where reality and fiction seamlessly intertwine. Each frame brims with mesmerizing visuals and unforgettable characters, thrusting you head-first into a whirlwind of kaleidoscopic madness that completely envelopes you in its intricate beauty. Essentially, what this film successfully does is transform conventional cinema into a sensory roller-coaster of cerebral delights.|0
"The ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" scene was a riot. I also guffawed at the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the Japanese guy and said ""Pearl Harbor buddy"". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure because I can't count that high.Funny thing, this 10 line requirement. Seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long, not too short. I hope I don't make it to 1,000 words before I get to line 10.I'm still two lines short."|1
It took me a while to find this movie since they do n't have it yet on DVD ( and I'm not even sure if they ever plan on releasing it in that format). After a tedious search online, I finally found a digital version available for rent. Though initially reluctant, given the low resolution, I decided to give it a shot, simply due to the immense curiosity I had surrounding this hard-to-find title. Surprisingly, it turned out to be worth it! The acting, plot, and overall atmosphere managed to grip me despite the less-than-perfect visual quality, making the experience a delightful find indeed.|0
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. In 1969, the transition among African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. Special mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery.|1
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid. It shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation. Jan Ellis was taught that a black man was a plague. He was raised to be that way. Then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs, Pastor Lekota. will he change his ways?. The film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another, it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy.|1
"As far as I know I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now, and I would have to say this was his best ""pre-zombie"" offering. In fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died, I guess, it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch?"|1
I thought this movie was pretty good ! OK , so maybe it had a few scenes that could make you roll your eyes or question the plot, but overall it was an enjoyable experience. The visuals and special effects were stunning and added a sense of excitement to the storyline. The acting wasn't exceptional, but the chemistry between the lead characters was palpable, which contributed to my investment in their fate. Admittedly, the script had its flaws and at times felt cliche, but the movie never claimed to be high art.|0
I went to the pre-screening of `` Rory O'Shea Was Here . '' I like this movie better than I anticipated. It follows the story of two young men with physical disabilities, Rory and Michael, who form a special bond in a shared-care home. The movie deals with sensitive and often overlooked issues related to disability, friendship, and independence. The witty and honest portrayal by James McAvoy and Steven Robertson had a captivating and inspiring effect on me. Through ups and downs, Rory and Michael challenge societal stereotypes, fighting to prove that they are more than their disabilities.|0
"""Nuovomondo"" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young US-American directors are strongly influenced by that). Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me."|1
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too.|1
Pity the Monkees . People always accused them of being manufactured ( which they were ) or being nothing more than a Beatles knock-off (which was only partially true). However, there's more to the story of the Monkees than just marketing genius. Beneath the surface of TV characters and pop culture novelty, they managed to create some truly catchy music and inspired an entire generation. Yes, they may not have always played their own instruments and wrote some of their own music, but their sound still left a significant mark on the industry.|0
This movie , based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt , is one of the best films I 've ever seen. Set against the backdrop of Apartheid-era South Africa, the movie brilliantly captures the life and transformation of Wolfaardt, a former white supremacist, who ultimately abandons his prejudiced beliefs and dedicates his life to combating racial injustice. With its gripping narrative and superb performances from the actors, this powerful and thought-provoking film resonates deeply with the viewer, prompting introspection and understanding of the roots and consequences of hate. Its emotive portrayal of the importance of tolerance and the potential for personal change makes this a must-see cinematic masterpiece.|0
"I saw this film at a small screening. Even though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. It's April 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their ""mid 20's"" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes."|1
A labor of love . Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you . Then the sheer emotion and story-telling elevate it to a masterpiece. The intricacy and passion poured into every scene is tangible, with the exquisite details leaving the audience mesmerized. The tapestry of intertwined storylines unravel with seamless beauty, enticing you deeper into its depths, urging you to discover more. From the engaging characters that enrapture our hearts to the remarkable twists and evocative nuances that form a visual feast, the sheer dedication behind every brush stroke of this wondrous art leaves an indelible imprint on your soul.|0
Who ARE the people that star in this thing ? Never heard of them ! ! But this is one of the best movies I've ever watched! These hidden gems, showcasing some incredibly talented yet unknown actors, keep the film industry alive and thriving. While these individuals may not yet grace the covers of magazines, their dedication to their craft brings authentic, raw performances to the screen, making this movie such a captivating and memorable experience. It reminds us not to dismiss productions with lesser-known actors – give them a chance, as you just might witness the birth of a future superstar.|0
"This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film (which is excellent). It borrows the main premise--a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English professor, instead of a private dick, as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake. But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score)combined with an affected ""noir"" feel."|1
"NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p*** off three OTHER guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know, beat the living daylights out of one of our ""heroes"", the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally KILL one of the other guys!"|1
This was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts in a wonderful performance. His great likeability, coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him (and by extension myself, as his confidante and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended, I was so wrapped up in it.|1
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love film, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny, smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you.For those with a poor attention span, high expectations and no brains.. well.. um.. you may get bored and find things dragging at times.This is a charming, modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through..This film is a little gem.|1
"""Hari om"" is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name(played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India. There's no ""Bend it like Beckham"" backdrops and stereotypes, and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood (however, the soundtrack is well worth procuring), but rather, the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors."|1
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family 's journey from the Old World ( Italy ) to the New World ( America ) in search of a better life. Set in the early 20th century, the film chronicles the trials, struggles, and sacrifices the Mancuso family faces as they navigate through the complex process of migration. As the family bids farewell to their close-knit community and culture, they face an oceanic crossing in a cramped ship. Upon arriving on American shores, they experience hope and heartache at the infamous Ellis Island processing center.|0
This is probably my favourite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! Always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show. There is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.It seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. Here are a few examples. (The episodes start again when they end - but DON'T play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. With most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.|1
Gary Busey's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography. Since had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see that fine actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well.An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Thankfully, Mr. Busey was Oscar-nominated for this, losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A fairly low-budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with GREAT SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope this made plenty of dough.|1
No, I have not seen the original series and I won't compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species.|1
"(Some spoilers included:)Although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surreal means:""Fantastic or incongruous imagery"": One needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read James Kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, ""NO way!"""|1
This is a funny movie . The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but it would depend on the audience response. The dynamic duo, Bob and Eddie, share a series of comedic misadventures that will have you laughing out loud. Their quick wit and quirky sense of humor deliver endless laughs and quotable moments. As they find themselves in one ridiculous scenario after another, Bob and Eddie navigate their way through these challenging situations while hilariously figuring things out along the way. The strong chemistry between the two leads provides a fantastic foundation for future films to come.|0
"`` I am ... proud of 'Head ' , '' Mike Nesmith has said . He should be , because ""Head"" is a testament to Nesmith's creativity and boldness as a musician, actor, and producer. Released in 1968, ""Head"" showcases not just his skills, but also that of his fellow Monkees, as they challenge the norms of that era's entertainment industry and tackle subjects that resonate even today. Blending comedy with moments of sincere drama, psychedelic visuals, and unconventional narrative structure, ""Head"" was groundbreaking and risky for its time."|0
Really , This movie should be released to DVD . I just got a bootleg copy of what I think is the director's cut, and I am beyond impressed with its content and storyline. I firmly believe that if it were to be released to DVD, this hidden gem would finally receive the recognition it deserves. Fans of independent films would absolutely cherish it, as it offers a unique and fresh take on cinema, pushing the boundaries of storytelling and cinematography. Releasing this movie on DVD would not only do justice to the talented creators but would also cultivate an appreciative fanbase that thrives on remarkable art.|0
"As a film buff, I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip ""If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon""). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation."|1
I 've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much ) and I can say without a doubt that it's an absolute gem! The content is incredibly diverse and never gets boring. The hosts manage to strike a perfect balance between humor and factual information, ensuring that I stay entertained while I learn about new technology, gaming updates, movie and TV show recommendations, and more. The daily viral clips never fail to make me laugh or impress me with the innovation on display, and the weekly segments like “Around the Net” offer a wonderful insight into various trending topics.|0
I first saw `` Signs of Life '' on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation . It 's a wonderfully atmospheric and thought-provoking drama that has stayed with me since that initial viewing. Set in the heart of World War II, the film follows the journey of three men forced to confront their prejudices and insecurities while faced with the difficult task of staying alive in the midst of turmoil. Brilliantly written and brought to life with superb performances, this poignant and introspective tale not only provides a deeply personal lens into wartime, but also explores the complicated aspects of the human psyche under tremendous emotional strain.|0
"Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including ""N.I.B. "", ""War Pigs"", and ""Paranoid"".Also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans."|1
This movie got better with time. I can't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this at the age of 15. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man.|1
"William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature . Faulkner mostly wrote about the American South, exploring themes of social and racial tensions, family dynamics, and personal struggles. Known for his distinct literary style, his writing was characterized by intricate plots, engaging narrative techniques, and complex characters. Notable works include ""The Sound and the Fury,"" ""As I Lay Dying,"" and ""Light in August."" Throughout his career, Faulkner persistently focused on the tumultuous changes facing the South as it grappled with modernization and preserving its history and identity."|0
"It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It memorializes the NY city mind set of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, hoist by by own petard, and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they ""really are""... I don't think it is ever shown anymore. If so, surely someone would Tivo the thing and put it out there."|1
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, Tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. Tiffany and Chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk! !Don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. It is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!My rating : 9/10.|1
I love the TV contest . Hate to see it end . There are so many talented contestants . It 's always thrilling to see them showcasing their skills week after week, continually evolving and stepping up their game. It is incredible to witness such creativity, determination, and drive in one place. Of course, as with any competition, the process can be emotional and heart wrenching, seeing the elimination of personal favorites or that emotional tear-jerker episode. But, these emotions keep viewers gripped, passionately discussing with friends and family about each episode's highlights, making the show's end harder to say goodbye to each time.|0
"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film ""The Enemy Below"" from the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer & German U-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars."|1
I wish there were more films about middle aged people . The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life during middle age are rarely explored in-depth in mainstream cinema. Instead, we mostly see youth-centric plots, simplistic rom-coms or overly sentimental films that offer limited insights into the struggles and triumphs of individuals navigating their forties and fifties. Just like younger characters, middle-aged protagonists possess a plethora of diverse experiences that could entertain and enlighten viewers, reflecting on topics such as parenthood, reinventing one's career, or rediscovering life post-retirement. These untapped stories have the potential to impact the industry and make cinematic experiences even richer.|0
where do we go from here? that is the overriding question of this film. And make no mistake, 'mainly ETC. ', the 2003 effort from director john jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one.much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and I'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer.|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once, about ten years ago. I remember I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. The most important thing in this movie isn't the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie.|1
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm .... Only that this was one of the most intriguing and captivating anthology series of its time. First aired in 1995, the NEW OUTER LIMITS was a true masterpiece, carefully crafted to bring awe-inspiring, thought-provoking, and spine-tingling stories to television screens. This groundbreaking sci-fi series perfectly captured a surreal, mysterious, and suspenseful atmosphere. The storytelling took on varying concepts and topics, ranging from bizarre, eerie encounters with the supernatural, to fascinating adventures into parallel worlds and time travel.|0
`` Showtime '' falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying , and a little south of what the most ardent fans may expect. While it has its flaws and inconsistencies, the series definitely has its share of gripping, adrenaline-pumping moments that keep the viewers hooked. The storytelling, particularly in the latter half of the series, shows signs of both inventive genius and frustrating haphazardness. At times, character development seems to take a backseat, resulting in some narrative arcs feeling rushed or disjointed. Nevertheless, the ensemble cast delivers stellar performances that manage to engage viewers, transcending the weak script at times.|0
I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast ! The atmosphere was buzzing with excitement as we walked into the theater, eagerly waiting for the show to begin. From the opening scene, we were hooked - the visuals, acting, and storyline were all incredible. We couldn't help but gasp, laugh, and cheer throughout the movie. There were a few unexpected twists that added extra depth to the plot and the characters. Even after the film ended, we continued to discuss the memorable scenes over some post-cinema snacks.|0
i did not read the book . nor do i care to . the movie was a beautiful romance , though I know it can't fully capture the depth and intricacies of the original written work. Still, the captivating performances by the leads managed to touch my heart and draw me into their intense love story. Visually, the movie was stunning, bringing to life both the majestic scenery and the subtle nuances of the characters' emotional journeys. Regardless of my disinterest in the book, this movie stands as a testament to the power of great storytelling, where art transcends its original medium and affects audiences regardless of format.|0
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. I tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. The film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. It's one of my favorite slasher films and I have no idea where an uncut version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the USA where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen.|1
"I absolutely adore this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in it, so I figured it had to have some worth, you know? I watched it the first time just shaking my head . . . huh? Then it was the last scene and I found myself aching from smiling so hard. I clicked ""play movie"" and watched the whole thing again. It is without doubt the quirkiest movie I've ever seen. But the more I watch it, the more I love it."|1
This interesting film noir features three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick, and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. Demming, as the detective, is unfortunately not nearly as good. He lacks the intelligence, strength, and cynical world view of a Bogart. Had Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic.Pace, location (a library), and atmosphere are all good. But there are a few plot holes. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless organization (Nazis) he represents. Yet after mistakenly killing Blackmer, Sanders seems to experience no anxiety or remorse.|1
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job . He apparently has a natural talent for comedy and keeps the audience engaged with his charismatic presence. The way he seamlessly balances both the confidence and awkwardness of J. Douglas Williamson, a young man finding himself in such a peculiar and unpredictable situation, is truly impressive. The actor's impeccable comic timing and amusing expressions have everyone in stitches throughout the scene. Moreover, his ability to keep the atmosphere light-hearted and enjoyable, even in a somewhat risqué situation like strip poker, is a testament to his versatility and flair for comedy.|0
"""Showtime"" is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents,A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(Eddie Murphy)a cop, tries to arrest Mitch not knowing he's a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz."|1
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good. And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. The other two principals were ""decent"". But the characters themselves...what on earth was so bad about the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him behaving like the martinet Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an insufferable jerk who I was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise. Who was I kidding? Tom Wilkinson isn't Paul Bettany after all."|1
Loved today 's show ! ! ! It was a variety and not solely cooking ( which would have been fine, too). But it was really great to see different segments – like fashion, wellness, and entertainment – all interwoven seamlessly throughout the program. It truly kept things fresh, engaging, and exciting for the viewers. It's wonderful how you all bring creative, informative, and trendy topics to life with such enthusiasm and genuine passion. Can't wait to watch more of these well-rounded episodes, as they genuinely offer something for everyone.|0
Like a few people I know, I came in late on 'Stingers'; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way I'd miss an episode. The show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'Blue Heelers', for example. The crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me.|1
But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning.I'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not Medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic.|1
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce , Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman 's remote cabin in the mountains, hoping to provide comfort and support. Upon arriving, she's startled to discover that Susan has invited their estranged brother, Michael, to join them for an unexpected family reunion. Over the course of the weekend, the siblings unearth deep-rooted grievances, face unresolved issues, and address long-forgotten family secrets. As they confront the tumultuous memories of their childhood, Kate tries to help Susan reconsider the path to divorce, and to find strength and resilience to navigate the challenges of her troubled marriage.|0
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative.|1
I gave it a seven only because the acting is good . And of course by that I mean Wilkinson and Anderson's performances, which were both incredibly convincing and engaging. The plot, while not entirely original, had enough twists and unexpected turns to keep me hooked till the end. The cinematography and use of setting really complemented the story, creating an atmosphere of tension and unease throughout the movie. However, certain scenes felt drawn out, and some supporting characters were underdeveloped, which prevented the film from being an outstanding success.|0
I had heard of John Garfield , but , did n't know him . I loved this movie . I never knew John could leave such an impact on viewers like myself. In the movie, he brilliantly portrayed the character's emotions and conflicts, showcasing his impeccable acting skills. His screen presence was truly magnetic, and I found myself fully absorbed in his performance. I highly recommend others to watch it too, as it's an unforgettable masterpiece that highlights the artistry of John Garfield. From his impressive talent to the compelling plot, this film has turned me into a newfound fan and truly broadened my cinematic horizons.|0
Another enjoyable Warner flick . I really liked John Garfield in this , though I 'm wondering why Cagney was not cast in the lead role as he would have been a perfect fit. Nevertheless, Garfield's gritty performance was compelling and effectively carried the story. The supporting cast also delivered solid performances, making for an all-around entertaining and well-crafted film. The dialogue was sharp, and the pace moved at a good clip, keeping my attention throughout. Overall, the atmosphere captured that signature Warner Bros. style of the 1940s era that we've come to know and love.|0
I 've never seen the original `` House Of Wax '' so I really did n't know what to expect going into this film. But to my surprise, the remake starring Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray turned out to be quite an enjoyable watch. The story follows a group of friends who find themselves trapped in a creepy wax museum where the sinister curator has created disturbingly lifelike sculptures using actual human bodies. Though not exactly groundbreaking, the film does offer a good dose of suspense, thrilling chase sequences, and a chilling atmosphere.|0
I never heard of architect , Louis Kahn , until this documentary . In this almost two hour documentary which features a combination of interviews, archival footage, and beautiful visuals of Kahn's masterpieces, one truly begins to understand and appreciate the genius and impact of this great architect. Louis Kahn's innovative designs, infused with profound humanism, inspired a whole new generation of architects. Through heartfelt anecdotes from family, friends, and clients, the documentary also explores his tumultuous personal life, illustrating a compelling and inspiring portrait of a visionary whose works continue to dazzle and amaze the world today.|0
"Chucky (the murderous doll from ""Child's Play"" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using ""Voodoo for Dummies"") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds."|1
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war . Everything about the movie was perfect . The captivating cinematography seamlessly captures the beauty and brutality of the times, effortlessly intertwining the complex emotions associated with both love and war. Each scene impeccably showcases the deeply raw chemistry shared by the passionate protagonists, which effectively enables viewers to experience their euphoric love affair through empathetic connections. However, the movie never fails to underline the tragic consequences and horrors that engulf the battlefield, subtly yet convincingly providing a poignant portrayal of star-crossed love amidst harrowing conflict.|0
When the new Outer Limits first started , the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging . As the series began to develop, the creators continued to explore thought-provoking and inventive themes, which led to increasingly captivating storylines. Delving deeper into issues like time-travel, extraterrestrial encounters, and experimental science, the show started gaining a large following among science fiction enthusiasts. This ambitious, complex approach helped cement its legacy within the sci-fi genre. While still retaining its characteristic eeriness, the Outer Limits found a balance that offered intellectual escapism and touched upon prevalent topics related to ethics, technological advances, and the human condition.|0
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not A-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup.|1
"Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. He spends time ""over there"" in World War One trenches. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. The cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. Chaplin ends up capturing several German soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them."|1
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel,I have to say out of all the shows that I've seen that ADV released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again,and that's when I got my chance. I bought the entire box set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th Birthday. And I got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that I missed on Action Channel,and the same 3 episodes that I've seen.|1
SHOWTIME is a mess , but it 's an entertaining mess . The plot is forgettable , the satire is half-baked, and the characters are shallow, yet there's something inexplicably enjoyable about the chaos unfolding onscreen. Amid the whirlwind of flashy action sequences and chaotic comedy, it's impossible not to be amused. This may not be high cinema or intellectual satire, but it's perfect for an undemanding viewing experience that entertains without requiring too much from the audience. Essentially, SHOWTIME thrives in its ability to transform imperfections into an unapologetically enjoyable thrill ride.|0
This film is an impressionistic , poetic take on the immigrant experience , a reflective look at the turmoil and uncertainty faced by those who leave their homeland in search of a better life. As it beautifully explores the delicate balance between assimilation and preservation of cultural heritage, it delves deep into the emotions, challenges and personal sacrifices involved in the quest for belonging. Set against a haunting and mesmerizing backdrop, the narrative interweaves snippets of various stories and characters, creating a compelling tapestry of diverse voices and experiences that offers glimpses into the myriad facets of migration, loss and hope.|0
"I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci's films. Most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining ""Zombi"" (which was a George Romero imitation), I didn't really enjoy them. I know Italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. This is why ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" surprised me. Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery."|1
"the first time I saw this movie , I just thought `` what the hell ? '' a 10-year-old kid the first time I saw this movie, I just thought ""what the hell?"" A 10-year-old kid running around fighting bad guys, outsmarting everyone, and even driving a car? The whole concept seemed absurd and far-fetched. But as I watched the film unfold, I started to appreciate the charming wit, and adventurous spirit captured by this young protagonist. While it may have its quirks, it brilliantly reminded me of the unbounded imagination that runs wild within a child's mind."|0
"The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 `` They Made Me a Criminal . '' The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 ""They Made Me a Criminal."" Playing the lead character, a wrongly accused boxer on the run from the police, he demonstrated the makings of an accomplished actor that would earn him numerous accolades throughout his career. In the film, Garfield masterfully displays a unique blend of intensity, vulnerability, and street-smart charisma which kept the audience engaged in his pursuit of justice."|0
"I went to the pre-screening of ""Rory O'Shea Was Here."" I like this movie better than I expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. It's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. Rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. Well, it is."|1
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as just another patchwork of mindless violence. And while there is a fair amount of mayhem, DEATH WISH 3 is not that awful of an effort, particularly for fans of the series and its star.This time out, aging Charlie's Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory, where he once again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good versus evil.|1
I was n't expecting a great deal from this film , so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found myself genuinely engaged and entertained. The plot was unexpectedly refreshing, boasting intriguing twists and interesting character development that piqued my curiosity throughout. The cinematography was visually striking, accompanied by an evocative soundtrack which contributed to the immersive experience. Stellar performances from the actors infused the film with emotional depth and conviction, making it easy to relate to the characters and their struggles. While it may not be groundbreaking, it's a well-rounded movie that deserves more credit than it initially led me to believe.|0
Some days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.Therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of affluence does Italy give to these poor people? How ever do they regard us as the Land of Plenty? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer.|1
"I don't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. You need to get your head out of your up-tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! If this isn't your ""cup of tea"", so to speak, then look at it for what it truly is- a damn funny movie. Maybe they DID set out to make yet another drugs/T&A movie, but in this case, they've truly hit the spot. It's especially funny for the Ali G fans, because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him."|1
When the trailer for Accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. It's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. That being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one.|1
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.This is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see it now- FANTASTIC!The acting is excellent, and Dublin plays a starring role. This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. I can't wait til it comes out on DVD.|1
I saw this film at a small screening . Even though it had a low budget , the creative direction and storytelling were top-notch. The actors, although not very well-known, delivered compelling and believable performances that instantly drew the audience in. The story was simple, but emotionally resonant, dealing with themes of love, friendship, and loss in an unexpectedly relatable and captivating manner. Visually, the film was engaging and had a gritty, real-life feel to it. It proved that sometimes it doesn't take millions of dollars and A-list celebrities to create a memorable and touching movie experience.|0
"Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads . The movie is centered around Bartleby Gaines, played by Justin Long (known from the Mac and PC ads), who, after being rejected by every college he applied to, creates his own fake institution named the South Harmon Institute of Technology (S.H.I.T.) to maintain his façade of success. To his surprise, several other rejected students also start attending the ""university"". Hilarity ensues as the group strives to legitimize their school, evade education authorities, and forge friendships through unconventional means."|0
This is my favourite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! Peter Falk is on form as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favourite episode). The supporting cast are great especially Julie Newmar (very under-rated) and Jeanette Nolan as the house keeper that Columbo just keeps on upsetting.|1
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development . Fulci was a master at creating horrific imagery and spine-chilling atmosphere, which this film definitely did not disappoint on. The chilling music and eerie settings really managed to captivate the audience and hold them captive throughout. In addition to the unsettling visuals, the thought-provoking storyline and carefully crafted personalities made the experience both thrilling and engaging. I genuinely cared for the characters and their journey as they navigated through their chilling surroundings. The themes tackled throughout were unsettling and brutal but handled in a way that wasn't gratuitous.|0
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling . Despite being primarily known for his gory, horror masterpieces, Fulci surprises the audience in this piece, presenting a finely tuned, dramatic narrative. This engaging film unravels the complexities of the human experience while intertwining emotions such as love, deceit, and resilience. As the characters are brought to life through striking visual and psychological depth, it is evident that Fulci's remarkable attention to detail results in an astounding sense of reality.|0
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actor's were very good.|1
Like some people here, I love/loved Stingers! In Norway it got aired a lot later. That also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers might be the on series(except from Grey's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personallly I think she is one of the best access we have!|1
That 's right . Ohwon ( the painter and the main character ) is an exceptional person . What strikes me the most about him is his incredible artistic talent and insatiable passion for painting. Despite facing numerous hardships in his life, Ohwon's determination to create astounding masterpieces remains unshaken. Throughout the story, his unwavering commitment to art acts as his solace and savior in tough times, showcasing the immense power of creative expression. While his life's journey might be filled with pain, chaos, and upheaval, his remarkable resilience and unwavering devotion to art ultimately help Ohwon achieve unparalleled recognition and appreciation.|0
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children at large. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema  a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffectual police, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mentally-retarded loner etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.Unusually for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle.|1
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce shows with limited resources and lower budgets? Absolutely, the golden age of television we're experiencing is changing the landscape, fostering creativity and diversity in content. Smaller production companies, niche networks, and streaming platforms provide an opportunity for fresh, experimental projects and storytelling formats. As a result, this generates room for ambitious newcomers to break into the industry and make innovative shows accessible to viewers who would not typically engage with such content.|0
"Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n ' roll . The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock, Texas, quickly rose to fame with his signature blend of country, rhythm, and blues that would influence generations of musicians to come. His distinctive look, characterized by thick black-rimmed glasses and a Fender Stratocaster guitar, became synonymous with his brand of cool yet innocent rebellion. Sadly, Holly's promising career was cut short when he died in a tragic plane crash at the age of 22, alongside fellow musicians Ritchie Valens and J.P. ""The Big Bopper"" Richardson."|0
it 's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight that leaves them with legal and emotional consequences. As they navigate the aftermath, each friend deals with the guilt and embarrassment in their own unique way. Throughout the movie, viewers witness the strength of their bond and how this particular incident turns out to be a turning point in their friendship. The film takes a sincere look at the meaning of camaraderie and how trivial misunderstandings can snowball into major conflicts. Along with unexpected twists and dark humor, this well-crafted story keeps you hooked until the very end.|0
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in the making, one would be hard-pressed to expect any less. I did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones, which is naturally only a minor gripe.David Attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative, leaving enough room for one's imagination, and well spaced out, so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery.|1
These critics need to find a new job!!! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY, which has made history. It illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece has captured my heart and soul as if I too were there. The Blue eyed Cage & the delightful Cruz were amazing! Together they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. This movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!! !|1
I've commented once on this Chucky great, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. The film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because I cherish Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS!!! And the gore was shockingly great! The scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful!|1
"Is this a good movie? It's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when ""the old gentleman"" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.Yes, what lurks in the Maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact."|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it.|1
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. The direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. While the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. The soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration.|1
SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. But I laughed. A lot. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. This movie will get a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.|1
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. Nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on DVD neither on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How it's possible this could really happen??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and James Franco is hot as hell!! !Please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!!|1
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film? This breakthrough performance not only showcases the immense talent and versatility of the actor but also highlights the transformative power of art in allowing audiences to empathize with diverse experiences. It also sparks a broader discussion around representation in the media, questioning if able-bodied actors should assume disabled roles. Nonetheless, this groundbreaking portrayal signifies a critical cultural moment, sensitively and masterfully shedding light on a perspective often underrepresented or misrepresented on screen, opening new avenues for inclusive storytelling in cinema.|0
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply . I 've been looking for certain films or television shows that are not available for purchase or streaming, yet I've found fan-made copies or edits available online. While I understand that these companies are concerned with potential revenue losses, they fail to realize the market they are missing by not offering legal access to these productions. The demand clearly exists and instead of stifling fan enthusiasm with legal threats, production companies should find ways to tap into these audiences and monetize these older or rare pieces of content.|0
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already gone through so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very glad now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie.I won't give a synopsis of the plot, because other reviewers have already done that. But I will say that I don't understand comments that it's bleak, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic.|1
"I 'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci 's films . Most of his 80s gore films had their moments of shocking visuals and creativity, but many also fell short in terms of storytelling and coherence. However, with that said, there are some hidden gems that showcase Fulci's true talent as a director. Among these standout works, you'll find more atmospheric and unsettling horror, such as ""The Beyond"" and ""House by the Cemetery,"" which do not solely rely on gore to make an impact."|0
It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's careers. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not Robert's. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def.Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat.|1
it's a great movie for the whole family. i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure. i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy from her.|1
This is sweet . The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira in the cult classic horror movie series. It is interesting to see how versatile she is in her roles, bringing something unique to each character she portrays. From flaunting her sultry charm as Elvira, the campy vampy mistress of the night, to being the charismatic, energetic nurse with gonzongas, the actress truly embodies the spirit of transformation in cinema. No wonder her acting prowess, magnetic appeal, and contribution to popular culture remain etched in our hearts and memories even to this day.|0
Great movie . Post-apocalyptic films kick ass . This one is no exception . Kept up the pace and interest throughout, with an engaging storyline and dynamic characters that truly bring the ravaged world to life. Intense action scenes seamlessly blend with emotional moments, providing an authentic sense of the desperation these survivors experience in a dystopian society. The cinematography brilliantly captures the stark landscapes, adding an eerie beauty to the desolate setting. Additionally, the director and screenwriters demonstrate their expertise in drawing the audience in and evoking deep emotion while propelling the narrative forward. A thrilling, immersive cinematic experience that shouldn't be missed!|0
I usually give horror films around 6/10 , but this one caught my eye . House of Wax was by far the most terrifying and intriguing horror movie I have seen in a while. With a gripping storyline and top-notch acting, it kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The chilling atmosphere and the excellent use of visual effects truly elevated this film beyond my expectations. Instead of relying solely on gore and jump scares, it skillfully combined psychological tension with well-paced action to deliver a spine-chilling masterpiece. Consequently, I rate House of Wax a solid 9/10 – a must-watch for horror enthusiasts.|0
As I have said before , I am NOT a fan of Tweety . He 's just so aggravating I cannot help but cringe whenever I see him on the screen. It's a shame too because Looney Tunes has so many great characters like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck who possess wit and charm, and Tweety just sticks out like a sore thumb among them. Perhaps it's because I find his voice grating, or because his perpetual victim status constantly demands attention, Tweety lacks any of the memorable or redeeming qualities of the others.|0
WTF ! ! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending ? ? The Notebook was good ... OMG, I know, right? It seems like Nicholas Sparks loves to give us major emotional rollercoasters with all those heartbreaking plots! While The Notebook does have a bittersweet, satisfying conclusion, I feel like most of his other works like A Walk to Remember and Dear John often end with such tragic twists! Honestly, his novels and the movies adapted from them should come with a tissue box because they never fail to make us shed tears!|0
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse.|1
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father, Louis Kahn, dead since 1974. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work.|1
"`` Showtime '' is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro ( Meet the Parents , A Bronx Tale ) and Eddie Murphy (Coming to America, Beverly Hills Cop). In this action-comedy, DeNiro plays a grizzled, no-nonsense detective forced to team up with Murphy, an ambitious but bumbling cop hungry for stardom. Together, they join a reality TV show documenting their crime-fighting adventures, often clashing with hilariously unpredictable results. Directed by Tom Dey, ""Showtime"" delivers a potent mix of fast-paced action, witty banter, and uproarious situational comedy."|0
I really enjoyed this film, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobbys and show them as people with emotions. As this film needed to show Bobby as a cold and vindictive person.I agree with another review it was sick love, not true love. He didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together.|1
As many of today 's movies are guilty of , the plot is n't exactly stellar , the movie does have some redeeming qualities that manage to make it an entertaining experience for audiences. While relying heavily on CGI and special effects to capture viewer attention, the filmmakers managed to blend humor and witty dialogue amidst all the high-octane action sequences. Although the cast isn't filled with A-list talent, their chemistry is undeniable, giving a convincing portrayal of the character dynamics. The movie won't be remembered as a cinematic masterpiece, but it surely delivers enough thrills and laughs to keep moviegoers satisfied.|0
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house . This energetic and exuberant film truly captures the essence of foot-tapping music and unforgettable dance sequences. The entire production team has gone all out, giving the audience the delightful and uplifting feeling that music can invoke. This contagiously lively cinematic experience seamlessly encourages everyone to tap into their inner dancer, bop to the beats, and perform unapologetically wild dance moves. Each choreography piece displayed on the screen sets one's heart racing, and it becomes absolutely impossible to resist jumping around the room in jubilant celebration.|0
This is probably my favourite TV show ever . I love all the characters , especially Alex , who is such a dynamic and intriguing person. Every episode has an enthralling storyline that never fails to captivate my attention, leaving me eager to watch more. The mixture of drama, humor, and twists make it stand out from other shows, ensuring a fresh and enjoyable experience each time. Moreover, the character development throughout the series is incredibly well-written and I've grown attached to all of them. Even the side characters provide a depth and charm to the show, adding that extra layer of perfection.|0
When I was 10 ( currently 14 ) , I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would make me cry. This decision stemmed from a particularly traumatic experience where I ended up bawling in front of my friends at the movies. It was a painfully embarrassing incident that caused relentless teasing. But last week, as I reluctantly agreed to watch a heartfelt drama with my friends, I realized I was limiting my experiences by actively avoiding emotions. As the tears welled up and my friends gently nudged me with sympathetic smiles, I found a newfound appreciation for these kinds of films and ultimately, self-acceptance.|0
"I 've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark . I 've noticed that people often compare it to more established streaming platforms, resulting in biased opinions. However, one needs to appreciate Showtime for its diverse content offering and excellent programming. Though it may not boast the most expansive library or widely-discussed originals, the quality of the available content more than compensates for this. Additionally, Showtime has consistently produced groundbreaking series like ""Homeland"" and ""Dexter"" which showcase unique storytelling and depth in their narrative arcs."|0
"This movie is true action at its finest, It doesn't get any better then this. This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this. My favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a TV or something and he goes right up to them and yells ""I will come in here anytime i like!!!"" and right before he jumps out the window he yells ""Anytime!!!"""|1
This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title . The movie was cool , despite the initial skepticism surrounding it, as it successfully managed to preserve the charm and nostalgia of the original while adding new elements that catered to a contemporary audience. The storyline flowed seamlessly, incorporating both action-packed scenes and unexpected plot twists, which made it hard for viewers to take their eyes off the screen. Brilliant performances by the ensemble cast and exceptional direction combined to bring this movie to life, and it definitely deserves recognition for bringing new energy and dynamics to the story of the cult classic.|0
When his elderly mother Emily ( Jeanne Bates ) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier ( Brion James ) , a distraught Daniel (Johnathan Schaech) decides to take matters into his own hands. Against the advice of his girlfriend Sarah (Amanda Plummer), Daniel enlists the help of his childhood friend Leo (Donald Sutherland) to carry out a plot for revenge. As the plan starts to unravel, Daniel soon discovers Nestor's violent past and unspeakable secrets. But his quest for retribution turns into a dark spiral, leading to an explosive confrontation between Daniel, Nestor, and their respective demons.|0
"When I first saw this movie,I also expected ""our boys"" to be cute,and more like an extended version of the TV show. I didn't ""get it"" back then. But,years later,at a party YEARS later,at a 70s' type PAR-TAY,where certain substances had been smoked,inhaled,and with plenty of tequila,""HEAD"" was on late at night.We watched it,and finally realized what ""HEAD"" was all about. It spoofed their own show,as shown in one song that called themselves,""a manufactured image""."|1
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it . The acting was phenomenal, especially by the lead actress whose emotional range truly captivated the audience. The storyline was intricate, delving into the depths of human relationships and the power dynamics at play in various settings. The cinematography was beautifully executed, taking us through the winding streets of Italy, effortlessly transporting us into the characters' world. The heartwarming ending resonated long after the credits rolled. Kudos to the talented director for creating such an exquisite film - it surely deserves more recognition on the global platform.|0
I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon . I loved the film so much that it ignited my passion for musical theatre. The harmonious blending of enchanting music, spellbinding acting, and riveting storytelling left me completely mesmerized. The journey of the protagonist seeking purpose and identity amidst the mystical city of Shangri-La opened a new world of creativity and inspiration for me. As the melodic notes of the song 'The World is a Circle' echoed, I dreamt of someday being part of such a soul-stirring masterpiece on stage or in the making of the grandeur that a musical holds.|0
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt , My parents loved it and we would all gather around the TV to watch it together as a family. The combination of humor, action, and quirky characters really brought the show to life and captivated its audience. Each episode kept us laughing and eagerly anticipating what would come next. Now that I'm older, I appreciate even more the talented actors, creative storylines, and ingenious mix of different genres. Watching this show not only takes me on a trip down memory lane, but also highlights the unmatched charm of classic television.|0
"William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else. In short, he's what more actors should be like. ""A Slight Case of Murder"" is directed by Steven Schachter, who went on to do two more great films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap).Television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting, poor cinematography, and sub-par scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to see a TV movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for."|1
"This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans . Okay I 'm sure it 's not as good as the original ""Child's Play,"" but it definitely brings back the nostalgic terror that Chucky instills in everyone's hearts. The plot remains engaging throughout, combining slasher thrills with clever, dark humor. As always, the film is elevated by Brad Dourif's incredible voice work as the iconic Chucky. While newcomers to the franchise might find some aspects outdated or campy, die-hard fans will surely appreciate the homage to classic Chucky tropes, as well as a few new twists thrown in for good measure."|0
Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh : as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a psychedelic farce in this groundbreaking movie that will blow your mind. Directed by Bob Rafelson and co-written by a young Jack Nicholson, this anti-establishment gem unapologetically dismantles the manufactured pop image of the Monkees, showcasing their underrated talents while addressing the Vietnam War, materialism, and politics of the era. Both irreverent and clever, Head delves into the consciousness of the time through a wild, fragmented narrative interspersed with offbeat musical numbers, ultimately celebrating the bizarre humor and boundless creativity of the 60s.|0
At one time `Buddy Cop' movies ruled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a T.V.|1
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. It is just not available and it has not been on TV for many many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. Also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.My 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it.|1
A well written screenplay. A moving story showing the middle class English at it's best. Some great acting by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. The director, Julian Fellowes did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. It has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the English middle class.|1
I saw this movie on it 's opening night , and enjoyed it . I probably would have enjoyed it even more if it weren't for the excessively hyped up trailers and spoilers that I couldn't avoid. Despite this, the movie exceeded my expectations, and I believe the story plot, characterization, and visual effects were stunning. The chemistry among the actors was incredible, bringing authenticity to their characters, while the soundtrack perfectly complemented every scene. The action-packed sequences and moments of comic relief contributed to an overall satisfying and thrilling movie experience.|0
An interesting look at the immigrant experience , told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this unique tale because it took me on a fascinating journey that unfolded the lives and perspectives of various immigrants, all interwoven within the framework of an enchanting fable. The unconventional mix of mystical elements and bizarre visuals provided a refreshing contrast against the realities faced by these diverse individuals in their pursuit of a better life. The author brilliantly used the allegorical nature of the story to shed light on some prevalent cultural issues that are experienced by immigrants worldwide.|0
probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's!|1
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film , The Life of Jimmy Dolan They Made Me a Criminal, released in 1939, is a drama and crime film that revolves around the protagonist, a falsely accused man on the run from the law, inspired by the storyline of the earlier Warner Brothers film The Life of Jimmy Dolan from 1933. Like Jimmy Dolan, the main character of the remake, Johnny Bradfield (played by John Garfield), finds himself falsely accused of a heinous crime after the sleazy lifestyle he'd fallen into led to unforeseen tragedies.|0
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it doesn't hold up. This glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. Just doesn't fit.|1
This film , like much of their music , is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer . It delivers a unique and immersive experience that is both visually and audibly captivating. While it may not be tailored to please everyone, those who give it a chance will find themselves delving deeper into the story and becoming more appreciative of the intricate layers present in both its cinematography and its score. Although its subtle intricacies can make the overall impact harder to grasp for some, the movie remains an essential and unmissable piece for dedicated fans, art aficionados and discerning viewers seeking unconventional narratives and innovative visual interpretations.|0
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer, one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be ""forgotten"" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan ""that's hot"" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???"|1
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall it's a fun and entertaining experience that captures the essence of adolescent life. As with most teen flicks, you'll find a blend of clichéd high school stereotypes, cheesy yet lovable romances, and comical misunderstandings mixed into the plot. You'll definitely roll your eyes at the occasionally exaggerated humor and unbelievable antics, but at the end of the day, you can't help but enjoy this lighthearted, feel-good journey of growing up.|0
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be . Terrible acting ! Implausible scenerios ! Ridiculous death scenes! And yet, it has an irresistible charm that makes it an undeniable cult classic. In this outrageous installment of the Death Wish series, Charles Bronson returns as the vigilante, Paul Kersey, facing an array of dangerous gangs terrorizing his New York City neighborhood. Loaded with unintentional hilarity, over-the-top violence, and gloriously absurd dialogues, Death Wish 3 serves as a perfect reminder that cinema doesn't always need to take itself too seriously.|0
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? This film does not answer the latter question either way, but it does appear that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. Like most new producers/directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb).|1
A labor of love. Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. Then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. I have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. The remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and I felt I was a part of the drama unfolding before me. The casting is as perfect as one can get.|1
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title ""The Chaplin Review"".This was an odd film in some ways because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. This film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the US efforts in WWI. It's truly odd to see Charlie as the ""super soldier"" who single-handedly captures 13 Germans, casually and coolly shoots several Germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser himself!"|1
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery 's best performances in a movie , and I have seen almost all of her works. In this particular film, Elizabeth Montgomery brilliantly portrays a character filled with complexity, effortlessly depicting various emotions with grace and authenticity. She carries the weight of the entire story on her shoulders and pulls off a genuinely compelling role, commanding the audience's attention from the very beginning. Her versatile acting and expressive subtlety elevate the quality of the film and help the other cast members rise to the challenge.|0
"Let me clarify that. This is not a ""good movie"", but I am so glad it is out there, I am so glad I saw it, and for the role that it plays in my DVD collection, it is sublime. It is the ultimate PG-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on Mars. It is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable."|1
Enchanting . The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad . It 's all just so whimsical and heartwarming that it effortlessly lifts your spirits and transports you to a world full of wonder and magic. The characters are so lovable and engaging that they feel like friends on this beautiful journey. The cinematography is captivating, leaving a vivid visual feast for the eyes. With its feel-good message and perfectly timed comic moments, the film acts as a comforting embrace, ensuring that your worries will melt away by the time the end credits roll.|0
"As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I adore AristoCats. It is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the ""best"" kids movies these days. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing."|1
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon (""Action"") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon)."|1
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade . She smokes and drinks . She does n't have a lot of friends, as she keeps to herself and is more comfortable with solitude.

This new world presents her with thrilling adventures and new friends that accept her quirks, celebrating her for being her unique self. This transformative journey empowers Jade, teaching her how to embrace her oddities and stand up against the bullies.|0

I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I 'm dying to know its title. The plot revolves around a small group of people stranded in a haunted house, where a malevolent presence torments them. As they start delving into the house's tragic past, they discover its terrifying connection to the occult. This low-budget horror gem features convincing performances, along with masterfully constructed tension and atmosphere. It scared me out of my wits, and left an indelible mark on my young mind. Does anyone else remember watching this obscure horror classic on TV or recall its title?|0
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy ( Garlin ) wandering around Chicago with a camera, capturing life's absurd moments. He encounters various eccentric characters, highlighting the city's unique cultural mosaic. The protagonist struggles with personal issues, feeling lost in the urban jungle, finding solace in humor and wit. Garlin delivers a masterful, multidimensional performance that keeps the audience engaged, resonating with their own emotional vulnerabilities. Showcasing genuine comedic prowess and a deft ability to inject heartfelt insights into daily moments, Garlin has crafted an entertaining and introspective cinematic gem.|0
"Before I forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the ""direction"" in here, because it's really good.To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat."|1
This movie got better with time . I ca n't believe that it has been forty years since I saw it for the first time, but it truly seems to age like a fine wine. The plot, once considered cheesy and dated, now takes on a classic, timeless feel. The cinematography and special effects that were cutting-edge back in the day are still enjoyable and a testament to how groundbreaking they were at the time. As the years go on, I have developed an even deeper appreciation for the movie's skilled storytelling, character development, and raw emotions.|0
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen : much better and deeper than Luhrman 's Romeo and Juliet, with all due respect. In The Snowqueen, the intertwining of elements such as vulnerability and devotion amplifies the very essence of love, unlike traditional portrayals which rely heavily on overly romanticized moments. What sets this movie apart is its exceptional ability to depict raw human emotions, interwoven with evocative themes of love, sacrifice, and tragedy. As you witness the depth of these emotions and experiences unfold on screen, the film will effortlessly leave an everlasting impact on the viewer's heart and soul.|0
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie, this won't be one for you. If the Truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. From a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in South Africa (and many other places).For historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as ""The Pianist,"" ""Schindler's List"" or ""Nuremberg."" Millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. This movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper."|1
"The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something akin to the first ""Starwars"" movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is wonderful."|1
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film? Probably someone. But no-one, truly no-one, could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film.Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as shown to us right at the beginning, he has huge trouble communicating. So it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member Rory (James McAvoy) who can speak normally, understands him.|1
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock, Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage angst.This easy to watch bio is not without flaws.|1
This was a riveting film , one that really drew me in . I 'm a big fan of William Dafoe and his exceptional talent, so his incredible performance in the lead role wasn't surprising, yet it completely blew me away. The film beautifully intertwined raw emotions and thought-provoking scenes, providing not just entertainment, but also depth that one rarely finds in movies these days. The director skillfully kept the momentum throughout, allowing each character's development to grow while unfolding the gripping storyline. The ending left me emotionally satiated, making this film an extraordinary cinematic experience I'll definitely watch again.|0
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates `` Separate Lies , '' a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson , Linda Bassett, and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, this British drama is a powerful adaptation of Nigel Balchin's novel, ""A Way Through the Wood."" Wilkinson delivers a captivating portrayal of a reserved London lawyer, whose life gets turned upside down after discovering his wife's involvement in a mysterious hit-and-run accident. The complex, intertwined relationships that unfold paint a deep exploration of lies, loyalty, and guilt among the characters."|0
I've got to say it. Gary Busey saved this film. If it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. I recommend the film but just barely.The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the Holly sound?|1
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining . It provides updates of tech news , video game releases, gadget reviews, and industry events in a concise and engaging manner. The hosts are knowledgeable and have a great sense of humor, making the viewing experience enjoyable for both beginners and tech enthusiasts alike. The show covers a wide range of topics, ensuring there's something for everyone. It also regularly features interviews with experts, which adds credibility and depth to the discussions. All in all, this show is a valuable resource for anyone looking to stay informed and entertained in the constantly-evolving world of technology.|0
One of the most magnificent movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown on the career of director Winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it's never been topped. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate.|1
Lucio Fulci 's `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by a series of brutal child murders. This gritty film delves into the superstitious underbelly of this seemingly tranquil locale, as residents desperately look for a culprit among witchcraft practitioners and mentally challenged individuals. Through a combination of atmospheric cinematography, gruesome violence, and social critique, Fulci's disquieting exploration of fanaticism and hysteria unmasks the depths of inhumanity capable of stemming from paranoia and scapegoating, demonstrating how hidden vices within even the most picturesque rural community can reveal chilling depravity when a series of horrifying events unravel.|0
"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song, and now the terrific Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite TV shows as a kid, The A-Team. The only member he wouldn't be able to get was the late great George Peppard who played main character Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith, but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help. He did manage to reunite all members including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck #2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Capt."|1
Considering it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too.|1
"I don't see that much wrong with this movie. Granted, the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly carry a tune. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I happen to love their songs, especially ""The World Is A Circle"", ""The Things That I Will Not Miss"", and ""Question Me An Answer"". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic; I disagree on both counts."|1
"If we could have `` Separate Tables , '' why not `` Separate Lies . `` This becomes somewhat involved as the intricate webs of lies in our daily lives often converge at specific instances, with emotions running high and the search for truth more crucial than ever. ""Separate Lies"" portrays the story of individuals carefully balancing the different aspects of their lives, often colliding with one another, unveiling unforeseen consequences. Through moments of intense revelation, the seemingly insurmountable barriers among the characters slowly crumble, with their meticulously crafted deceit no longer effective."|0
I think that this short TV series, was absolutely wonderful, and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. This is definitely worth peoples money!I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the 'Blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life!|1
"I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer, and I'm so glad now that I have. It's truly a wonderful film. The actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. I love James McAvoy in this, and I can't wait to see him in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" movie this December. Romola Garai is wonderful too. Be sure to check her out in ""I Capture the Castle"" or ""Nicholas Nickleby,"" two of my favorite films."|1
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in the infamous plane crash back in 1959. As a pioneer of rock and roll music, his influence has never really faded. The unique blend of rhythm and blues, country and western that Holly infused into his tunes set a precedent for future generations. It's amazing to consider the impact he made during such a short period in the spotlight; one can only imagine what musical masterpieces he would have crafted had he lived a longer life.|0
The Aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on IMDb. The songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but they weren't bad at all. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great piece of animation was O' Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.|1
`` Back in the Day '' is an interesting , but flawed effort . Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper , a young man who gets caught in the midst of a dangerous world involving crime, drugs, and gang rivalry. In an attempt to escape the clutches of this dangerous lifestyle, Reggie tries to turn a new leaf by joining his high school sweetheart in pursuit of higher education. However, Reggie quickly realizes that completely severing his ties from his old world won't be easy. The tension mounts as old alliances and dangerous enemies threaten not only his dreams of a better future, but also his very existence.|0
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. (MINOR SPOILERS) As per usual, the main character, B, is the sane one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. He's known for making fake IDs. so an acceptance letter is no problem.Because B's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university.|1
An interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine much the same as my Grandfather did at that time. Travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships, I cannot imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this film.Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities.|1
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role.|1
You know, people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead...and it works. Not only does it work, it works very very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. But isn't that where great comedies come from?|1
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan , where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion . Blind Spot in Coyoacan garnered attention not just because of the riveting plot, but also for the thought-provoking subject matter. It incited insightful debates among the audience as they shared their diverse perspectives on the issues highlighted in the movie. The range of emotions exhibited by the people was palpable; some showed discomfort and intrigue, while others appreciated the unflinching portrayal of social issues. This engaging film was not only a visual treat but also left a lasting impact on the moviegoers and sparked stimulating discourse long after the final credits.|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I 'm Dancing I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little known Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing.' Intrigued by the title and excited for an authentic film experience, I invited a few friends and made a movie night out of it. It turned out to be a brilliant tale of two disabled men in Dublin who forge an unlikely friendship as they embark on a liberating journey to challenge the restrictions of their assisted living facility.|0
What a shame this movie was never released . ( It is now playing on cable . ) I tuned in expecting a captivating plot and riveting performances, but instead found myself utterly disappointed. The storyline was muddled and hard to follow, and the characters lacked depth and nuance. The actors tried their best with the subpar script but were unable to breathe any life into their roles. Perhaps the most redeeming quality of this movie is that its poor execution offers a lesson in how not to make a film. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else – there's no need to suffer through this misstep in filmmaking history.|0
I know this movie isn't for everyone, and I won't push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...It was the best I have ever seen!!! It was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't know what was gonna happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!|1
What a surprise this film was . I 've seen a good few of Fulci 's horror and zombie flicks and honestly, I was a bit skeptical when I decided to give this one a try. I wasn't sure if Fulci could excel outside of his usual genre, but boy, was I proven wrong. The plot took unexpected turns that kept me engaged from start to finish. Not to mention, the masterful way he blended dark humor with dramatic elements - it genuinely showcased his incredible versatility as a director. The actors' performances were gripping and real, and the cinematography had a unique, eerie ambiance.|0
You know , people who make comedies so often forget it 's really ok to be outrageous . Well , let me tell you, being outrageous is not just okay, it's essential! Comedy thrives on pushing boundaries, taking risks, and bringing out the absurdity in life's most mundane situations. Laughter is derived from unexpected twists and witty observations that play with societal norms, making it incredibly necessary to go above and beyond the conventions. After all, the world would be such a boring place if everything were mundane and straightforward!|0
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets up with them and offers to help them.|1
I loved this film!! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw it opening night and loved it, Some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made.|1
"If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost (for many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has an odd blend of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation-- even hints of slapstick, but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time, nothing has been seen like it since.I strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated, especially with Spike Lee's ""Bamboozaled"" (SP?) a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, disjointed script."|1
"Great show! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps. Contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. Grease has truly become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. ""You're The One That We Want"" is sure to gain even more Grease followers."|1
I can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19. I don't think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it. Nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as I had, and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by. Rent it, buy it or steal it.... a must see.|1

No. I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don't Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm.|1
I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden.|1
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. That's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!Next thing you know he's in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes here include a starving Charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.When Charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring.|1
"`` Head '' is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 . The Monkees, a band initially formed for a television show, challenged conventions and successfully transitioned from TV sensations to silver screen stars through this cult classic. ""Head"" delivers an engaging and often absurd mixture of music, psychedelic visuals, and socio-political satire, reflecting the vibrant counterculture and attitudes of the late 1960s. Driven by catchy songs and an irreverent sense of humor, this experimental comedy encapsulates an era of free-thinking and rebellious expression."|0
Even after nearly 20 years apart , the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing . In fact, they've only grown stronger as a cohesive unit. Their long-awaited reunion proved that they can still create electrifying music that captures the essence of their groundbreaking early work while demonstrating their matured artistry. Fans who witnessed this remarkable feat appreciated the harmonious combination of dark, aggressive riffs and powerfully melodic lyrics that characterized the band's unique sound. Critics, too, acknowledged the return of one of rock music's most legendary acts.|0
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode , THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the original Star Trek series. The introduction of the mysterious and enigmatic Romulan species, as well as the battle of wits between Captain Kirk and his counterpart, lends to an intriguing and suspenseful plot. Enhanced by themes of war and political allegory, the episode showcases strong character development and thrilling action sequences. Along with THE CITY ON THE EDGE OF FOREVER, these episodes highlight the creative genius and depth that Star Trek, even in its earliest days, provided as it made waves in the sci-fi television genre.|0
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink, casting a warm glow over the bustling scene below. As the camera pans down, we see people of all ages whizzing around the rink, their laughter and excited chatter mingling with the lively tunes of rock and roll filling the air. Among the happy skaters is our protagonist, Buddy, gliding effortlessly with a contagious smile.|0
"Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance/adventure. And by this, I mean ""good"", not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. East meets West in a different take on the buddy film. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth."|1
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD ( I 'm expecting to see the My Mother The Musical: Director's Cut hitting the shelves any day now), it seems as though the archival race is in full swing. This has led to a proliferation of digital treasures, spanning every niche imaginable, filling both online streaming platforms and dusty physical cases. However, amidst the hoard of resurfaced TV series, award-winning documentaries, and gripping original narratives, the question still remains – are these visual time capsules really worth digging into?|0
"""Head"" is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968. The movie is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image. It presents the Monkees in a way their fans never perceived them; men with real thoughts. Totally controlled by their producers, the Monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film pokes fun at their image, the entertainment industry, and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It's a movie well worth seeing over and over again."|1
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I 've just managed to watch this film for the second time after many years, and I must say it still captivates me as much as it did before. The incredible storytelling, masterful direction, and powerful performances make this a cinematic gem that stays with the viewer long after it's over. It's not very often that a film has such an impact on you, especially upon re-watching it after a lengthy period, but this one proves that great art remains timeless.|0
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man ( or even Tremors. If that's the case, then Motorama will undoubtedly pique their interest. Like its peers, Motorama offers an intriguing mix of eccentric characters, gritty aesthetics, and absurd situations that blur the lines between reality and delusion. This unique blend, coupled with tongue-in-cheek humor and an unabashed embrace of B-movie tropes, creates an irresistibly strange atmosphere. A road-trip-gone-wrong flick that exudes adventure and nonstop entertainment, Motorama's psychedelic undertones and curious character encounters make it a must-watch addition to any offbeat B-grade desert film lineup.|0
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS...Hmm.... Only that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled!! You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. Everyone playing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly!|1
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days . It was not a pleasant experience for me as I struggled to relate to the characters and the storyline. I would be home from school, too exhausted to concentrate on homework, and ended up sitting in front of the TV as it blared annoying laughter tracks and clichéd dialogues. With nothing much to do and a lack of good entertainment options, I tolerated the insipid show with reluctant boredom. I would have much preferred watching a nature documentary or even a corny but earnest afterschool special.|0
Can the intensity of a husband 's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime , despite the moral and legal implications? Absolutely, and there are countless stories throughout history that show this is true. When a husband is wholly devoted to his wife, the instinct to protect and stand by her may trump ethical and legal obligations, thus allowing him to engage in unthinkable acts to cover up crimes committed by her. Such loyalty and sacrifice might stem from various reasons, including fear of losing a cherished partner, keeping their relationship intact, or even succumbing to manipulation.|0
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. Fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.This film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Living Dead, House by the Cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of Italy.|1
This is one of my favourite Disney films. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way.|1
Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time . It has an original concept, hilarious characters, and a surprisingly heartfelt message. The story revolves around a group of high school seniors who, after facing rejection from their desired colleges, decide to create their own alternative institution, the fictional South Harmon Institute of Technology (S.H.I.T.). With offbeat humor, eccentric but lovable personalities, and a genuinely engaging narrative, this film expertly addresses the challenges faced by young adults as they navigate societal pressures to conform to traditional educational paths.|0
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt but became separated from his unit. After nearly starving and/or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy. It brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal. All things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter.|1
"This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 reminds me of ""West Side Story"" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick ""Gangs of New York"" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence."|1
So it 's not an award winner , so what ? Have you ever wanted to see a film that just takes you on a fun, entertaining ride without taking itself too seriously? This might be the perfect movie for you. Popcorn flicks have their place in the cinematic universe and they are certainly important, providing audiences with a respite from heavy and thought-provoking cinema experiences. While not everyone appreciates this particular subgenre of cinema, there is definitely an art to making light-hearted entertainment, and a unique satisfaction found in reveling in the occasional unpretentious film that just wants to entertain and engage its audience.|0
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still I enjoyed it. This time, Charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them. Death Wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and I enjoyed it every single second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page providing the music, with producers Golan and Globus still doing there thing and Charles Bronson is still acting good for Paul Kersey.|1
"Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) getting made CEO of a corporation after the white CEO dies (the white executives all hate each other and can't decide who should succeed the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization.I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! ""Putney Swope"" is the ultimate jab at America's power structure. It's the sort of thing that seems like it would have come out of Richard Pryor's mind."|1
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It's a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the Nashville record producer told him no. Buddy Holly didn't give up on what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie.|1
This is a brilliant film. The story starts off in Romania,where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. There is a really funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river.|1
Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius . And this movie is good ! Although the film does n't nearly reach the heights of his iconic roles such as Borat or Ali G, it still delivers ample laughs and moments of pure absurdity. His unmatched wit, unparalleled ability to inhabit different characters, and penchant for pushing the envelope make this another enjoyable installment in Cohen's repertoire. The supporting cast does a fine job in keeping up with his fast-paced, unscripted humor. Overall, the movie may not be a classic like his earlier works, but it certainly proves Sacha Baron Cohen's comedic talents have yet to falter.|0
I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion.|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west .... sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie Another go round with the Monkey King going west unfolds in an adrenaline-filled adventure, bringing the legendary journey to life once again. The movie opens with a chaotic battle scene, showcasing the prowess and extraordinary abilities of the Monkey King as he faces numerous challenges on his quest. Together with his brave companions - the noble monk, Xuanzang, the devoted and powerful Pigsy, and the calm yet wise Sandy, they delve deeper into uncharted territories facing unparalleled dangers.|0
Let's be fair: there are no RULES for scriptwriting, so I won't say the movie SHOULD be something other than it is. I'll just state my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. However, I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. Since this movie was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical.|1
Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good . I have to admit Ms Cruz 's performance was quite captivating and her chemistry with Mr. Cage was believable. The stunning visuals of Greece truly enriched the film's setting and the blend of romance, drama, and historical events managed to keep the story engaging. Despite a few clichéd tropes, the soundtrack added depth to the emotions portrayed on screen. All in all, while it may not be a cinematic masterpiece, Captain Corelli's Mandolin still makes for a heartfelt watch with some memorable moments worth experiencing.|0
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans chaired by a no-nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth. But the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market place and the political system demands that he conform, rendering him no different than his predecessors.|1
When the new Outer Limits first started, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to wind down, most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the very best, and worst, of the series.Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining to the flops.1. Afterlife: As an institution, The U.S.A. military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention plain stupid.|1
If you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci has done.It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone.Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest.Young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you?|1
"""A Slight Case of Murder"" is an excellent TV movie, which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress, and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite light hearted and funny, with many memorable lines (""Acting is harder than I thought- you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology"" and my personal favourite ""For next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day?"|1
I first saw The Victim ( aka Out Of Contention ) well over 25 years ago when I was very young, and I remember being absolutely enthralled by the plot and the acting performances. This mystery thriller, released in 1972, follows the life of Kate (played by Elizabeth Montgomery), who is forced to investigate the disappearance of her brother's wife. As a fan of classic thrillers, I was completely hooked by the twists and turns that left me on the edge of my seat. The complex plot showcases the evolution of crime thrillers in that era and still leaves a lasting impact after all these years.|0
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time . Top 20 for sure. The storyline was well crafted and brilliantly executed, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The characters were dynamic and developed, pulling me into their journey with realistic dialogue and gripping emotional moments. The cinematography was stunning and the visuals, absolutely breathtaking. The use of a powerful and impactful soundtrack just elevated this film to another level. I couldn't recommend this masterpiece more, as it genuinely transcends the definition of excellent filmmaking, providing a truly unforgettable cinematic experience.|0
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail.|1
A Formula For Murder isn't a well known Giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late on in the Giallo cycle, but more than stands up to many of the films released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. Despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes Argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters.|1
"This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is ""Amazing"" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain."|1
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800hrs) and I still watch it! I don't like the A-Team... I absolutely adore them!! It is just great to see Justin chasing the former members of A-Team. Brings back memories from the old days, when I was young an sweet. I would have given you a 10 for excellent, but Justin looks like he is chasing the former A-Team members all by himself. Of course, that is the only bad thing on this documentary.|1
Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. With World War One just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovable Tramp went to war! The film begins with the Tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant.|1
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic boundaries, breaking down barriers and unifying people from diverse backgrounds in their pursuit of success. It presents an honest depiction of capitalism's competitive nature, showcasing that with grit, perseverance, and cooperation, individuals can rise above any social and cultural limitations. As the characters navigate their complex entrepreneurial journeys, we are reminded that the lure of financial freedom is universally enticing, cutting through racial and ethnic lines, creating new allies, adversaries, and defining lifelong partnerships in the pursuit of a shared dream.|0
This is my favourite Columbo . Martin Landau ( excellent ! ) plays twins , one of whom may have committed a murder. The other twin seems completely unconnected and acts as an alibi for his sibling. As always, Peter Falk's performance as Columbo is superb - it's a joy to watch him slowly unravel the mystery surrounding the crime, which seems impossible to solve. His intuitive intelligence and determination bring to life one of television's most iconic detective characters. The supporting cast members also deliver commendable performances, and the gripping storyline is punctuated with clever twists and turns, keeping viewers engaged and guessing throughout.|0
Being American , I have not been exposed to this character before , which is good because some of you might not know him either, allowing us to learn together. As I researched this unfamiliar figure, I discovered a rich, fascinating cultural icon. The character, deeply rooted in the history and tradition of another nation, has captured the hearts and imagination of people across the world. Often portrayed in literature, movies, and television series, this character embodies strength, courage, and wisdom, which transcends regional boundaries.|0
Hey look, you don't watch this movie to change your life! But if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for Richard Gere; this movie is right up your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have on screen chemistry going way back. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not a Oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED good looking people (they don't make your stomach turn and even when Gere is 'on top' he does not look too jowly) then this is the movie for you.|1
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother doesn't take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother.|1
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International film Festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India....colorful, magical, thought provoking. Aside from one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor.|1
"Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but also unflinching honesty. ""A Delicate Balance"" takes an in-depth look at mental health issues, focusing on a single character, Rose, who battles with bipolar disorder. Throughout the film, the audience witnesses the highs and lows, alongside the misunderstandings and lack of compassion society often places upon mental illness. O'Donnell seamlessly navigates these challenges, showing the power of a supportive community while addressing the dire consequences that arise without that crucial network."|0
"Mark Blankfield (from the old late night TV show ""Fridays"")plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains."|1
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! Hat's off to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. I watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. This film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world.|1
This is a good film , no doubt , but with some odd aspects . Without spoiling anything it takes place in an eerie setting that adds an element of suspense throughout the entire plot. The well-developed characters have intricate relationships with one another, further contributing to the intrigue. Moreover, the narrative explores thought-provoking themes of human emotions, mental health, and ethics. However, the peculiar plot twists and stylistic choices could potentially alienate some viewers. It's easy to get drawn into this peculiar world, but certain directorial decisions might leave one scratching their head.|0
"(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby ""B"" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to."|1
OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, I ADORE her! How innovative. I love that she has a cooking section- I admit that occasionally I skip that part, only because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. I love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. I love how personable she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her Mystery Guests.|1
Before I forget , let me say the artwork in here is outstanding . From garbage cans to the huge mural that covers an entire wall, the attention to detail is exceptional. It seems that even the most ordinary objects have been transformed into pieces of art, creating a unique atmosphere within the space. It's fascinating how various materials like recycled metal and wood, have been crafted into sculptures and decorative items. Every nook and corner features delightful pieces that instantly capture your attention and admiration. As you move through the space, the color schemes and styles shift, showing a remarkable range of creativity and design skills.|0
Jeff Garlin 's film is filled with heart and laughter . As in Curb Your Enthusiasm , his screen persona is incredibly relatable, endearing, and hilarious. The storyline blends mundane aspects of daily life with perfectly timed humor, which adds depth and resonance to his character. Garlin's masterful ability to tell jokes, extract humor from everyday scenarios, and interact with an eclectic ensemble of quirky characters leaves audiences with a warm sense of satisfaction. His style effortlessly invites viewers into a lighthearted world, providing a sweet escape from reality.|0
Considering it 's basically low-budget cast , this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock 'n' roll legend Buddy Holly. Set in the late 1950s, it encapsulates the heady days of youth and the essence of early rock 'n' roll culture. While the acting can sometimes seem stilted, the genuine love for Holly's music shines through, with dynamic live performance sequences that capture his indomitable spirit. In a unique departure from biopic norms, we see deeper into the stories of fellow band members and his personal relationships that make it as much a tribute as it is an exploration of a fallen star.|0
Hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a bad-ass, funky film to watch some night, this is just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Any who.|1
* Could contain spoilers , read only after seeing last episode season 2 * Think about it . The guys from Elden Academy had quite a journey throughout season 2. The epic twists, unexpected alliances, and revelations left us on the edge of our seats. In the finale, our favorite characters, Jason and Toby, manage to uncover a massive secret about the academy that could threaten everything they hold dear. The constant tension between friendships and romantic relationships – particularly the complicated dynamic between Amanda, Luke, and Mike – have set the stage for potential drama in season 3.|0
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I 've ever seen on film . I do n't say this lightly, as I have been a passionate film aficionado for years, but this particular piece has left me in complete awe. From the enthralling plotline to the impeccable cinematography and captivating character development, every aspect of the film works in perfect harmony. The director has managed to tell a story that transcends beyond the confines of cinema and reaches deep into the human soul. The cast delivers emotionally powerful performances that bring the beautifully crafted script to life.|0
Barbora Bobulova's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by utilizing her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way Barbora does with this character. She was entirely believable as Valeria and I was swept away with her characterisation of this role. All at once the film was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound.|1
I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it . It 's one of those rare films that may not impress all with its storyline or screenplay, but it definitely captivates with its charm and authenticity. I can understand how some viewers may not be completely engaged, given its unconventional narrative structure and pacing, but one must truly appreciate the efforts put forth by the cast and crew to create this unique cinematic experience. I urge you to look beyond the popular opinion and give this movie a chance – its creative storytelling and heart-warming performances just might change your mind.|0
In Nordestina , a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco , Antônio ( Gustavo Falcão ) is the unofficial gatekeeper of the community. Antônio takes it upon himself to welcome outsiders, yet ensures they do not interfere with the traditional values and ways of the village. In his quest to balance his small community with the rapid onset of globalization, Antônio faces resistance and challenges. Just when he believes that things have taken a turn for the better, a new person enters the town who brings unforeseen changes that leave the villagers questioning their long-held beliefs and struggling to preserve their culture in a world constantly changing.|0
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian army officer and a beautiful Greek island girl in the WWII epic love story ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" still puzzles many fans. Madden saw in these two talented actors a potential to beautifully portray the profound emotions of love, betrayal, and loss intertwined in this dramatic story. Madden's faith in Cage and Cruz's incredible acting abilities, coupled with their dedication to building the necessary chemistry, elevated their performances, making ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" a heartwarming tribute to the human spirit in times of adversity."|0
Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over.|1
The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music . Filmmakers from all around the world were challenging the conventions of storytelling and experimenting with radical new ways to convey their narratives. At the forefront were visionaries such as Jean-Luc Godard, Ingmar Bergman, and Federico Fellini, whose unconventional films dealt with complex themes such as alienation, existentialism, and the nature of dreams. Social realism and critical approaches to established structures flourished, whilst the emergence of international auteurs like Akira Kurosawa brought non-Western storytelling into the limelight.|0
I wonder why I have n't heard of this movie before . It 's truly a magnificent comedy ( I haven't laughed this hard in a long time). The stellar cast perfectly delivers witty lines and nails the impeccable comedic timing. I've never encountered such a seamless blend of relatable humor and unique plot twists. Upon further research, I found that it has been out for a while and was, surprisingly, a sleeper hit. Now I am on a mission to spread the word about this criminally underrated gem of a film, and can't wait to show it to friends during a much-needed movie night!|0
This is one of Chaplin's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More opulent than the Mutual films, it continues Chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front.There is plenty of slapstick via the Limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree.By this stage in this career, the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves.|1
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates ""Separate Lies,"" a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car."|1
Wow, What a wonderful film-making! Mr. Im has done it, again!His last work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great film, but this one is even greater. Selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year row, this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a Korean culture.Simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up' who was considered as a prodigy in the late Nineteenth century.|1
This is possibly one of my favorite films. It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. However, on her birthday the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.I thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast.|1
Oh my word ! ! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or responsibility. It's as if the creators threw caution to the wind, prioritized cheap thrills, and threw a blind eye to any potential ethical concerns. To say I'm shocked would be an understatement. However, it's also a reflection of our society's increasing desensitization and eagerness to consume this type of content. Though disturbing, perhaps this should serve as a wakeup call for filmmakers and viewers alike to critically evaluate the media we create and consume, while striving for a balance between art and morality.|0
`` Blind Spot '' one of my festival favorites . I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers coming together in one place, all connected by a mysterious event that left a lasting impact on each of their lives. The blind spot, which is seemingly invisible to others, bonds them and encourages them to find a shared resolution. As the film unfolded, I was drawn into the intricately woven narrative and mesmerizing performances of the ensemble cast. Their chemistry was evident and it enhanced the sense of unity in the face of an intangible challenge.|0
The writers of lost have outdone themselves. Season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one. Locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself, but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island? He will have to if he wants to stay alive. I don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge.|1
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino (""The Antichrist"", ""The Killer is on the Phone"") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror!"|1
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and was such a delightful movie. It was shot beautifully around India and I want to go there now. The main actor..Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie..Monsoon Wedding. He was the total star of the show. Benoit's character cracked me up...was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great too. They were all great!|1
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war . The rain pours incessantly as soldiers trudge through mud and dodge falling bombs. Amidst this turmoil, our fearless and ever-optimistic protagonist, Chaplin, refuses to let the war dampen his spirits. With expert slapstick timing and mischievous wit, he inspires laughter and morale amongst his comrades. Be it transforming daily routine tasks into outrageous antics or using his quick wit and unique pantomime skills to escape deadly enemy traps, Chaplin never strays from the challenge. His resolute positivity reminds us of the indomitable human spirit even in the darkest moments of history.|0
Blind Spot's images are great. The action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. By the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heart-wrenching. The film score is nicely understated . Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. Hope you get a chance to see this film. It delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.|1
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary . I knew it was about climate change and its impacts, but I never anticipated how powerful and moving it would be. Through striking visuals and compelling narratives, the filmmakers provide an honest, human look at the urgent challenges we face due to our rapidly changing planet. This documentary highlights not only the scientific data and alarming statistics, but also the tangible, real-life consequences of global warming affecting people across diverse landscapes and communities. After watching it, I felt more informed, empathetic, and inspired to make a difference in whatever way I can.|0
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was . I was completely blown away by the captivating storyline, the unexpected twists, and the brilliant performances delivered by the cast. Not only did the movie boast impeccable cinematography, but it also showcased a skillful use of its visual effects, striking the perfect balance of awe and realism. Additionally, the music score seamlessly evoked the required emotions, drawing me deeper into the experience. Overall, this underrated gem of a movie is a masterful production and a must-watch for all cinema enthusiasts seeking high-quality, engrossing entertainment.|0
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. The most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. I don't think Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion, no matter how slight.|1
"I love this movie , though I do n't like how they picture Egyptians , being an Egyptian citizen myself I love this movie, though I don't like how they picture Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself. It seems like filmmakers have fallen into the trap of using cultural stereotypes to portray us. Egyptians are shown either as rigid historical figures or as the exotic ""other."" What we see on screen rarely encompasses the beautiful and diverse experiences that make up Egyptian culture. That being said, I do appreciate the compelling storyline, excellent acting, and the beautiful cinematography showcased throughout the movie."|0
"""Pearl Harbor, buddy."" This movie is brilliant! Sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. I'm one that goes for silliness, much like ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Airplane"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece!"|1
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year . You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime alone. This growing popularity of true-crime movies can be attributed to our fascination with understanding the darker aspects of human nature and the motives behind criminal behavior. Documentaries like Making a Murderer or scripted adaptations such as Mindhunter are not only riveting and educational but also push for the exploration of the criminal justice system, uncovering its flaws and inciting debate on serious societal issues. As long as audiences crave mystery and moral complexity, true-crime films will continue to hold an influential spot in our collective entertainment.|0
This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with a commoner's roots and significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths?of the film is that Im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik),?receive inspiration.The costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good.|1
"Hey look , you do n't watch this movie to change your life ! But if you are female especially , it's a fun, lighthearted, and enjoyable way to spend an evening with friends or alone for some much-needed ""me time."" The film provides laughs, romance, and moments of genuine camaraderie among its strong and relatable female characters. Sure, it won't make you ponder existential questions, but it doesn't have to! Instead, embrace its wit and humor and appreciate the refreshing dose of girl power on the screen."|0
A great movie . The movie was even better then the commercials put on . And believe it or not , the entire cast gave some of their best performances to date. The plot was filled with surprising twists and turns, making it unpredictable and keeping the audience hooked throughout. The cinematography and visual effects were spectacular, giving the movie an additional layer of richness and depth. The director really showcased their exceptional vision and understanding of storytelling, ultimately making the movie a memorable and exhilarating experience. A must-watch for cinema enthusiasts, this movie deserves all the praise and acclaim it's been receiving.|0
I do n't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor . You need to understand that not everyone shares the same taste in humor, and it's important to appreciate diverse forms of comedy. Laughter is subjective, and it should cater to a wide variety of audiences. If we limit ourselves to intellectual humor, we might lose the opportunity to bring laughter and joy to others who appreciate slapstick, physical, or other forms of lighthearted entertainment. Embracing diversity in humor enhances social interactions, builds connections, and reflects our unique individual preferences.|0
To say the truth , I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor . , and I always make sure to watch every film he stars in. However, I did not have high expectations going in, given that many of Cage's recent movies haven't exactly been well-received by critics. To my surprise, this particular movie had a very interesting storyline that kept me engaged from the beginning. The supporting cast complemented Cage's performance brilliantly, showcasing their talent through meaningful interactions with his character.|0
"Coming from the ""druggie"" generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it I can't remember but a few things."|1
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters . I had never heard of it before, and I stumbled upon it quite by accident. This gem of a film truly deserved the spotlight of the big screen for all to see and appreciate. Its compelling story, combined with brilliant performances and breathtaking visuals, made it a remarkable cinematic experience. With limited marketing, it ended up flying under the radar and slipped into streaming platforms without fanfare. It's a real pity as a theatrical release would have potentially resulted in higher viewership, rave reviews, and possible award nominations.|0
"I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci 's reputation as a director . Too often he 's dismissed as merely a ""gorehound"" or ""shock specialist"" without enough attention being paid to the innovation and artistry in his work. This reductionist approach overlooks Fulci's influence in shaping Italian horror and thriller genres, particularly his experimentation with plotlines and striking visuals. Though Fulci's films have attained cult status, I believe there's a lot more to explore beneath the gore; whether it's symbolism, themes, or meticulous narrative construction."|0
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life , the action was great , and i absolutely loved the storyline. The character development was phenomenal, and it kept me engaged from start to finish. The visual effects were breathtaking, showcasing incredible talent behind the scenes. Every scene had me on the edge of my seat, the suspense building and captivating me throughout. The humor was perfectly balanced with the emotional aspects of the story, providing an overall amazing experience. The chemistry among the actors was impressive, creating a truly immersive experience that exceeded my expectations.|0
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary ( a lot ) - but he is funny ! Chucky, the infamous killer doll, has returned with a twist - this time, he's swapping his frightening antics for some laughter! This reincarnation of the once-spine-chilling character now delights and amuses fans old and new alike with witty humor and quirky personality. The iconic doll we all used to dread has now transformed into a lovable, eccentric jester bringing forth plenty of unexpected laughs, ensuring audiences never look at Chucky the same way again. Who knew laughter would disarm our deadliest doll and capture our hearts?|0
Being a middle aged mom myself, I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us. Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life herself. I am not a big Richard Gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk, but learns something about himself.Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies.|1
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families and embark on a perilous journey to Europe in search of a better life. The film deftly captures the heart-wrenching emotional turmoil these individuals endure, torn between the need to support their loved ones financially and their unwillingness to abandon their dreams for a brighter future. As they navigate dangerous terrains and treacherous conditions, battling discrimination and despair, their tale serves as a poignant and powerful reminder of the enormous personal sacrifices migrants make for the possibility of a life worth living.|0
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live. I know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are are natives of NC. I was fortunate to see it at a local showing. At that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the movie.|1
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious . Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull character, Skullie, always brought a spooky charm to each episode. Not to mention Matilda, the witty and intelligent seafaring lass, whose comebacks had everyone laughing. Together with a plethora of unique sidekicks like Olaf the not-so-smart but ever-loyal servant, Bjorn the cowardly warrior, and Ylva, the singing enchantress, these vibrant characters constantly got themselves entangled in ridiculous situations that left viewers in stitches. Each character had their own comedic quirks, making for unpredictable and lively antics throughout the series, delighting the young and the young-at-heart alike.|0
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see. The acting, writing and production values are top-notch. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. However, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. It showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. It is thought provoking and entertaining. Congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie.|1
This is possibly one of my favorite films . It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda ( Chelsea Hobbs) who embarks on a thrilling journey to save her beloved brother, Kai (Daniel Peacock), from the clutches of the evil Snow Queen (Elizabeth Munro). As Gerda journeys through enchanting landscapes, she encounters whimsical characters, treacherous obstacles, and magical events that push her resilience and determination to their limits. This captivating story not only entertains but teaches valuable life lessons on courage, friendship, and the unwavering power of love.|0
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Academy Award winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see.|1
"A very suspenseful giallo from the director of ""L'Anticristo""(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.However the main story is about maniac(David Warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.The plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.The score by Francesco de Massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's ""The New York Ripper""(1982).Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!"|1
I am a guy, so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear likes to be in tear jerker movies. I would rather watch action/adventure/sci fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a tear jerker. Diane tended to over act a few times, as did richard, but they brought it around and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude, so you started out hating her. The movie is way too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece.|1
I can't get this flick off my brain. It's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. I've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did. There is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. It's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. Franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave.|1
Oh my gosh!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so incredible......I loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult. It is my favorite Disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I watch it a ton.....It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart.|1
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.The three lead actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.This film doesn't take the easy way out.|1
Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for Billy Crystal. This movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid.|1
"Telling the story would n't be the point at all , would it ? Barnens ö , spelled almost like ""children's island"" in Swedish, was a place where my soul found solace, surrounded by pristine nature and embraced by endless skies. As a young adventurer, I would get lost in the lush forest, entangled in the harmony of wind whispering through the trees, accompanied by my unwavering thirst for exploring hidden realms. There I would find peculiar secrets, learn invaluable life lessons, and share laughs and tears with the wisest teachers."|0
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce, Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance.|1
I saw the trailer and read some reviews , and I had low expectations for this movie . I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be much better than I expected. The plot was engaging, with some twists I didn't see coming, and the performances from the actors were on point. The cinematography was also impressive, giving the film a unique atmosphere that kept me immersed. Even though it wasn't perfect, with some cliché elements and occasional slow pacing, it was an entertaining watch that kept me hooked.|0
I thought this was movie was great , Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie . I absolutely loved their performances, as they managed to portray their characters flawlessly and in a way that truly resonated with the audience. The captivating storyline was well-constructed, and the character development allowed the viewers to become invested in their on-screen relationships. Not to mention the film's cinematography and visuals were fantastic, further adding to its allure. In my opinion, this movie deserves praise for the talented acting, memorable plot, and engaging overall presentation, making it a must-watch for fans of Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth alike.|0
The Child's Play series isn't a favourite of mine, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre.|1
I can not say this movie was a hilarious , but I must have had a grin on my face most of the time. The humor was subtle yet clever, incorporating well-timed dialogue and just the right amount of physical comedy. The acting, particularly from the lead actors, brought out each character's quirks and nuances perfectly, allowing the viewer to appreciate every laugh the film offered. Although it wasn't a side-splitting experience, it certainly was an entertaining watch and one that leaves you feeling happy and uplifted. This is a solid, light-hearted flick for when you need that easy-going charm and laughter.|0
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.|1
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback , and if anyone is confused about her past ( like why she was in the mental hospital), it has not been revealed yet. Desmond still recognized her face but couldn't pinpoint where he knew her from. Meanwhile, Libby was also piecing together her mysterious connection to Desmond, haunted by hazy memories of the encounters they had before. In time, their shared past would intertwine with present predicaments as more light is shed on their fateful intertwining stories. This path will uncover dark secrets, astounding truths, and a link they never would have expected.|0
`` Nuovomondo '' was a great experience . Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue . Nuovomondo offered a refreshing take on storytelling, where the visual aspect played a more significant role than the spoken word. It demonstrated how potent visuals and powerful imagery can lead to the creation of vivid stories without relying heavily on dialogue. Filmmakers who chose this approach engaged the audience in a different way, challenging them to interpret and understand the characters' actions and emotions purely through visual cues. Nuovomondo left an indelible impact, inspiring more filmmakers to tap into the innate power of visual storytelling.|0
That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. And the message is sad. It says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems.A great film of this wonderful Korean director.|1
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly(1936-59). He does have a spitting image to the man. Being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. I bet that Buddy Holly(Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work.|1
Containing Billy 's famous humor , this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure , pleasantly surprising viewers. Exploring themes of love, loss, and human connection, it showcases Billy's range as both an actor and comedian. The audience can still expect his quirky jokes, expertly intertwined with moments that pull on the heartstrings, creating an unforgettable and truly multidimensional experience. Supported by an equally talented ensemble cast, the film masterfully captures the delicate balance between laughter and tears, proving that even amidst sorrow, there's still a place for Billy's unshakable, irresistible humor.|0
"i did not read the book. nor do i care to. the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it. no, it was not a ""10"" film, but it was enjoyable. women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on ""in love"" and ""loving. ""also, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny. i enjoyed watching the developing romance. also, if you like Christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium."|1
"As far as I know I 've seen most of Lucio Fulci 's films , with the exception of some of his early comedies and a few obscure titles. His body of work ranges from giallo mysteries to visceral horror classics like ""Zombie"" and ""The Beyond."" Fulci's unique blend of atmospheric storytelling, gruesome special effects, and iconic visuals made him a pioneer in the genre. However, it's essential to approach his films with an open mind, as they're known for their disturbing and often bizarre content."|0
"It took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on DVD (and my VCR is not worth hooking up again). I guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. It is a slap stick spoof in the vein of ""Airplane."" I must say that when I watched it on Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than I do now."|1
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live . I know personally most of the locations showcased in the film, making it all the more special to me. The movie itself beautifully captures the essence and unique atmosphere of my hometown, and portrays the relationships among the residents in an authentic manner. As a result, it's a deeply nostalgic experience watching it – as if the film took a snapshot of my own memories and personal connections. The way in which the filmmakers successfully manage to preserve these elements and breathe life into the familiar landscapes gives it a truly heartfelt charm.|0
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog 's filmic work that is without comparison. The film showcases a blend of documentary and surrealism, immersing the viewer into the extraordinary journey of Dieter Dengler. A German-born American who fulfilled his dream of becoming a pilot only to find himself navigating through the dark world of war, imprisonment and, ultimately, freedom in the Vietnamese War. The atmospheric visuals and remarkable storytelling captivate the audience's imagination, urging us to examine themes such as determination, adversity, and resilience.|0
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. Almost every single he put out was a hit.So, I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice.|1
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is capted...the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones' own style.Chiahweson's desperate seek for inspiration and broadening his conscious led him to live the way he did, restless, outrageous, and yes very drunk! But still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect to his Master, respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection.|1
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I doubt it!Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie off of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever.Of course.|1
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO type channels. I missed the beginning but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you get the chance take the time to watch it. Every once in a while I think about having the cable company take off my Movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them.|1
I do n't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while completing some tasks. I decided to give it a shot, considering the reviews were mostly positive. Surprisingly, I found myself enjoying the film more than I anticipated. The engaging plot, compelling characters, and brilliant visuals truly drew me in and held my attention. Even though it didn't fit into my typical movie preferences, the overall experience had me immersed, proving that sometimes stepping outside of my comfort zone can lead to an unexpected yet pleasant experience.|0
I did n't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD . I knew it had a cult following and had garnered rave reviews from critics, but beyond that, my knowledge of the film was limited. Popping it into the player, I felt both excitement and trepidation, unsure if it would live up to the hype. From the opening scene, however, I found myself enthralled, unable to look away. The cinematography was stunning, the story compelling and the acting, truly extraordinary. I soon realized this hidden gem deserved every ounce of praise and appreciation.|0
Blind Spot 's images are great . The action draws you in completely , even though the movie is a bit slow at the beginning. The suspense gradually builds, keeping you on the edge of your seat, while the impressive cinematography enhances the overall experience. The characters are intriguing, with each one showcasing exceptional performances by the talented cast. The storyline is thought-provoking and filled with unexpected twists that keep you guessing until the very end. Overall, Blind Spot is an engrossing, well-directed thriller that stands out from the rest, and is worth a watch for anyone who enjoys high-quality cinematography and engaging plots.|0
I just saw this film and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.|1
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I 've seen in a while . It 's an emotional roller-coaster ride that captivates you right from the start. The brilliantly-crafted storyline and impeccable performances by the actors, tug at your heartstrings and leave a lasting impression. With powerful themes like love, redemption, and forgiveness intertwined within the gripping narrative, it holds a profound message of empathy, humanity and compassion, making it highly relatable to anyone who has experienced true love, in any form. The film also boasts striking cinematography and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that elevates the overall cinematic experience, making it an absolute must-watch.|0
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo ' ( hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door ' ), a fascinating Italian film directed by Emanuele Crialese. This captivating drama beautifully narrates the journey of a Sicilian family, the Mancuso's, as they emigrate from their rural life to a dreamt-about land called America. The depiction of early 20th century Italy is evocatively portrayed, illustrating both the arduous trip the immigrants undertook as well as the adversity faced by many during this era. The compelling storytelling, combined with an enthralling cinematography, immerses the audience into a past time filled with nostalgia, sorrow, and hope.|0
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from ""Ed"" and the new Apple computer ads."|1
"Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne's ""For The Flag"" by the Czech master director Karel Zeman.Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety."|1
Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie, was years earlier a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Don't Torture A Duckling. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town?|1
Years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The machine). As I re-read this little book again and again, I could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the Brazilian culture.When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.I can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text.|1
Let 's be fair : there are no RULES for scriptwriting , so I wo n't say the movie SHOULD have been written in a specific way. However, certain guidelines can be helpful when crafting a compelling screenplay. It's essential to have a captivating and original concept, an engaging structure with a solid beginning, middle, and end, and characters who evoke emotions in the audience. Additionally, dialogue should sound natural, but also progress the plot and deepen characters. Don't forget to throw in some unexpected twists, to maintain viewer interest throughout, and ultimately deliver a satisfying conclusion that leaves the audience thinking.|0
Yes , at times `` Unconditional Love '' overwhelms as it bounces -- no , as it ricochets -- from heart to heart, soul to soul. It's an overpowering, yet comforting energy that surrounds and intertwines us. The boundless affection pierces through the barriers we create to shield ourselves, leaving us awash in feelings we can hardly put into words. Unconditional Love sets ablaze the flickering embers of connection, offering an exhilarating sense of freedom in being accepted wholeheartedly. So immense, so tender, and so luminous, we find ourselves wanting to shout its glory from the mountaintops, immersing in its eternal glow.|0
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it (typical Malibu Barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! I watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just a ace actor. Total hero man. The main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax!|1
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar ! The film took a while to pick up from the initial slow pacing, but once it did, the humor and entertainment truly soared. It's another hilarious, thought-provoking adventure that once again manages to capture the magic of the previous films. Jim Carrey, staying true to form, shines as the hapless but lovable protagonist navigating through yet another sticky, supernatural situation. This installment blends rib-tickling comedic sequences with meaningful life lessons, a mix of supernatural happenings, and our beloved actor's jaw-dropping physical humor.|0
I never thought I'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad).|1
I'm not going to go into too much depth, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it's moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was Trey Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell.|1
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... And it is very funny. So I didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of all show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I ever saw.|1
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji , a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The film delves into the struggles Kenji faced in pursuit of his art and expression of his love for humanity and the environment. Faced with personal losses and a tumultuous society, Kenji was often in conflict with the world around him, giving rise to a complex artistic sensibility that fueled his creative work.

The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper , but no one he interviewed seemed to fully catch on that he was just playing a character. Created by Sacha Baron Cohen, Ali G would don ridiculous attire and throw nonsensical questions at politicians, celebrities, and various influential people, making it awkward yet incredibly amusing for viewers. His over-the-top antics not only mocked pop culture, but it shed light on the unsuspecting participants and the extent they would go to tolerate absurdity. A groundbreaking phenomenon, the show was often uncomfortable, outrageous, and unexpectedly satirical, pushing boundaries in comedic entertainment.|0
"The ""old dark house"" sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. Here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he must die that very night. Meanwhile the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs."|1
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot . Some dude named Gerald decides to make an amateur horror movie in his hometown. To make things more realistic, he incorporates elements from the real haunted history of the place. The film shows the story behind the actual events in a parallel timeline along with the crew members struggling with the challenges they face while shooting. Gerald believes the realistic touch will be appreciated, but little does he know that in meddling with these stories, they awaken supernatural forces beyond their understanding, causing incidents to occur as they bring the haunted legends back to life.|0
A mix of 70 's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line . As I 've mentioned earlier, the 70s were an interesting time for creative experiments in humor, and this was reflected in films, television shows, and even comic books. Combining the irreverent drug humor with the lampooning of the medical profession and a familiar narrative style, audiences were treated to an offbeat, sometimes hilarious mashup that capitalized on the unique vibe of the era. As characters weaved in and out of these strange narratives, lampooning popular culture tropes, they succeeded in turning expected medical dramas into gut-busting laugh riots.|0
"Films belonging to the ""film noir"" genre usually contain similar elements: a ""deus ex machina"" plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a denouement in the desert. Think ""High Sierra"" or ""White Heat. ""There is plenty of hard-boiled bad film noir out there. But when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.It is this latter tradition that ""Blind Spot"" belongs to."|1
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title. The movie was cool,despite the fact, I hate new ones! All of the cast was awesome . It has great cast and an awesome plot!! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder , neat eh? !Dennis Quaid is the man who is ""D.O.A""(in other words Dead On Arrival).He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect! !Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him."|1
No real plot , no character development , no Scorcese-level direction , but seriously , were you really expecting any of those from this film? As a fun-filled, action-packed adventure, it hits all the right notes to keep you entertained from beginning to end. Despite the lack of substance and depth, this movie makes up for it in creative visuals, perfectly choreographed fight sequences, and its unique blend of humor and self-awareness. Think of it like a rollercoaster ride that has been put together with pure joy and adrenaline rather than logic and precision. Not everything has to be an Oscar-worthy masterpiece to be worth your time.|0
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent . He runs away from his parents and decides to go on an adventure of his own. Leaving behind his tiny hometown, Gus jumps on a train that takes him through winding countryside and bustling cities. Along the way, he befriends other vagabonds, some of whom show him the harsh reality of street life. Little Gus must use his quick thinking and resilience to get by each day. However, in the course of his journey, he comes to realize that there's more to life than evading responsibilities.|0
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people would n't like it . This unconventional movie strays from typical Hollywood blockbusters, opting instead for an edgy, complex storyline, which could polarize audiences. Its innovative approach, eclectic visuals, and strong character-driven narrative might either fascinate or disappoint. Consequently, certain viewers may relish the uniqueness of this bold experiment in cinematic creativity, appreciating its courage to shatter tropes and traditions, whereas others might dismiss it as too bizarre and avant-garde. Regardless of the polarization it might elicit, the film certainly stands out as a remarkable artistic exploration.|0
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival . It was the opening night, and the atmosphere was buzzing with anticipation and excitement. This beautiful and poignant Indian drama directed by Vikram Yoganand transported the audience to the vivid and culturally rich world of Rajasthan. With stunning cinematography and captivating performances, Hari Om was an emotional exploration of self-discovery, resilience, and compassion. The film tells the story of the titular character who sets out on a journey to rediscover his forgotten past and in the process, ends up forging heartfelt relationships.|0
"Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, ""The Man"" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world."|1
The Child 's Play series is n't a favourite of mine , but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay entry in the franchise. Unlike the other films in the series, Bride of Chucky adds a new layer of dark comedy, while still maintaining the sense of horror. This fresh take introduces Tiffany, a great sidekick to the main antagonist, Chucky. The dynamic between Chucky and Tiffany offers humorous moments and intensifies the gory thrills, resulting in a guilty-pleasure watch for fans of the genre. Although not groundbreaking, Bride of Chucky stands out among the series for its enjoyable blend of horror and humor.|0
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10, and it just blew my mind every week with each episode, every episode had a twist and each week I couldn't wait for the next. How the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, Alien and human encounters, and an insight into more of the paranormal, and how it affects the people.|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once , about ten years ago . The film adaptation stays relatively faithful to the source material, transporting viewers into the heart of Verne's fascinating world. Set amidst thrilling landscapes and mysterious creatures, it follows the adventures of the protagonists as they embark on a daring journey to places previously unknown. Ten years after reading the book, the essence of the narrative has been beautifully translated to the screen, and I am reminded of the whimsical wonders of my childhood.|0
"Valeria, an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference of being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a ""yes"", ""no"" or ""I don't know"". The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent."|1
Hey all you jive hustlers , you stone foxes , you mean dudes . Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town, and he's ready to groove like never before!

"David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life , this time the creatures under the sea , in this extraordinary documentary series ""Underwater Wonders."" Attenborough invites viewers to delve deep into the unexplored underwater world, introducing an astonishing array of sea-dwelling creatures both familiar and exotic. Audiences are treated to mesmerizing visuals of glowing bioluminescent life, eerie hydrothermal vents, and spectacular coral reefs. Journeying through oceans, gulfs, and vast watery expanses, Attenborough not only presents us with breathtaking imagery but also highlights the importance of preserving these underwater ecosystems for generations to come."|0

One day, while reading a book at a cozy coffee shop, a fascinating stranger caught her attention, their eyes met, but her shyness forced her to quickly look away. Realizing the missed opportunity, Valeria decided it was time for a change. Filled with determination, she attended confidence-building workshops, making small strides day by day. Ultimately, Valeria transformed into a more assertive and self-assured woman who no longer lived behind a wall of shyness.|0
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC . I 've been looking for it ever since . It was one of those captivating movies that I just couldn't get enough of. The suspenseful plot and strong character development made it a truly gripping experience. The film follows the story of an emotionally disturbed woman and how her condition intertwines the lives of the other characters, leading to unexpected outcomes. Since watching it on AMC, I have checked every online platform and video rental stores for the chance to re-experience this cinematic masterpiece.|0
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of ""The English Patient,"" even down to a scene similar to when Ralph Fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. In ""A Passion in the Desert,"" the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. Final shot will haunt me for weeks."|1
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally , at the end of the 1960 's . Packed with an extraordinary cast, an innovative script, captivating visuals, and groundbreaking special effects, it was a true gem that left an undeniable impact on the viewers. A reflection of the changing cultural landscape, the film bravely explored contemporary themes that resonated with its audience, pushing the boundaries of cinema as an art form. Its seamless blending of artistic innovation and mainstream appeal has helped it stand the test of time, maintaining its reputation as an influential classic in modern film history.|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.The film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from Muscular Dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, as Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying.|1
Without going into any details of a good ... if a somewhat provocative ... TV movie , there seems to be a trend emerging in the industry where filmmakers are constantly pushing the boundaries, raising important questions and prompting challenging conversations through their thought-provoking storylines. This particular TV movie cleverly weaves together elements of suspense, emotion, and moral quandaries to provide a unique and gripping experience for viewers. The complex and nuanced character development ensures that we, as an audience, can empathize and engage with the unfolding drama, stirring powerful feelings and initiating impassioned debates around contemporary societal concerns.|0
This is one of my favourite Disney films . It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation - memorable characters, enchanting storylines, incredible music, and a sprinkle of magical moments that captivate the heart. From its enchanting fairy tale settings and exciting adventures, to the well-rounded cast and compelling themes, it takes us on an emotional journey with plenty of heartwarming lessons along the way. You just can't help but get swept up in its world of vibrant colors and awe-inspiring landscapes, where imagination runs wild and dreams come true.|0
This is a 100 % improvement over the dross of a third movie and it 's one hell of a ride. With a captivating storyline, intriguing characters, and non-stop action, this fourth installment is just what fans needed to cleanse their palate from the previous debacle. A tight script and visually stunning set pieces make for an immersive experience that will surely be talked about in years to come. Kudos to the filmmakers who pulled out all the stops to give us something truly spectacular this time around. Let's just hope the upcoming sequels will learn from this example and never veer back into disappointment territory.|0
Then again , I like Rachael Ray . She is fun , sweet , fresh , and such a joy to watch in the kitchen. Her recipes are easy to follow, appealing to both beginners and seasoned cooks alike. The way she shares her culinary knowledge and incorporates relatable stories make her stand out as an influential figure in the cooking world. Rachael's bubbly personality brightens up my day and always inspires me to try something new in the kitchen. Her versatility across various cuisines and creative spins on classic dishes add flair to the world of cooking, making it enjoyable for everyone.|0
"where do we go from here ? that is the overriding question of this film . And make no mistake , this film dares to ask the tough questions and takes viewers on an enthralling journey filled with complexities and moral dilemmas. As the protagonists delve into uncharted territory, facing uncertain consequences, the gripping plot continuously challenges the audience's own convictions. Masterfully exploring themes of resilience, courage, and the unfathomable depths of the human experience, ""Where Do We Go From Here"" pushes the cinematic boundaries and redefines conventional storytelling."|0
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn 's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father, Louis Kahn. The documentary provides a poignant insight into the enigmatic world of Louis Kahn, showcasing the architectural marvels he designed and shedding light on the man behind them. Delving deep into personal experiences, Nathaniel expertly unravels a complex relationship between a father he hardly knew, and the genius whose work left an indelible mark on the architectural landscape. Simultaneously emotional and illuminating, My Architect ultimately reveals an intimate portrait of a conflicted man's quest for both self-discovery and closure.|0
"I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. I go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a ""story"". I found this to be a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :)Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere isn't an over-actor. He held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. He brings his own style to the movie.I think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told."|1
This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.I don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I haven't even read the book, and guess what?|1
Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage 's better films . He turns a fine performance as the titular character, an Italian soldier stationed on the idyllic Greek island of Cephallonia during World War II. His portrayal is both emotionally charged and charming, displaying a rare sensitivity as his character navigates the trials and tribulations of wartime life. The stunning scenery, remarkable acting from an international cast that includes Penélope Cruz and Christian Bale, and the deeply moving soundtrack further contribute to making Captain Corelli's Mandolin a memorable and poignant experience.|0
This movie is truly a classic 80s movie ! A must have in any '80s ' movie collection ! Guns , explosions, big hair, and rock music - everything you want in an epic '80s flick! This rollercoaster of action and emotion really transports the viewer back to a golden era of cinema. With unforgettable characters, unforgettable fashion and mind-blowing stunts, it encapsulates the true essence of the decade's unmatched vibe. The ultimate guilty pleasure, you can't help but enjoy the wild ride it provides, complete with eye-rolling one-liners and nostalgic joy.|0
"I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car ""to get stripped"" deserves whatever happens to them.The guy, Wade who ""went to a barbershop and asked for the He-Man haircut"" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. That's a little too high-maintenance for me. Also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks ""like Elton John only gayer,"" but that whole plot goes nowhere!"|1
I 've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer , and I 'm delighted to say that it did not disappoint. The visuals are absolutely stunning, and the story has the perfect blend of emotion, humor, and thrilling action that kept me fully engaged from start to finish. The characters are well-developed and their relationships are portrayed in a genuinely moving manner. Moreover, the incredible soundtrack only enhances the experience. Overall, this film is definitely worth watching, and I can confidently recommend it to any fan of captivating storytelling, regardless of genre.|0
This is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. Without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only- a Sicilian farm, the boat,and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything. I wonder if this was to save money? No street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close ups. And the music...what on earth was going on with playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they were out?|1
Really, This movie should be released to DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio film and I was utterly pleased!!! It was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo & Juliet, and also John Gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone I thought that for the small amount I was spending it would be fine. Boy was I right.|1
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. His TV antics include comic interviews with unsuspecting high-profile figures and ridiculous stunts, resulting in a dedicated fanbase that's grown consistently since his debut on Channel 4's The 11 O'Clock Show. Riding high on his TV success, Ali G made a successful leap to movies with 'Ali G Indahouse', a comedy hit which gained a cult following. His widespread popularity transcends media boundaries, making Sacha Baron Cohen's hilarious character a permanent fixture in modern entertainment.|0
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply unforgettable romantic drama. The movie, based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, is set in the picturesque coastal town of Rodanthe, North Carolina, where we are introduced to Adrienne (Lane), a woman seeking respite from her tumultuous life, and Dr. Paul Flanner (Gere), who arrives at her Inn with emotional baggage of his own. As a fierce storm approaches the small coastal village, the pair find solace in each other's company and engage in deep conversations, revealing past struggles and profound regrets.|0
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about an ex-Viet Nam POW in Laos who escaped, but I didn't know much else. In reality, I wasn't expecting too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during WWII and the hardships.|1
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it again one more time before I... well.. you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) ""captures"" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end?"|1
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series -- my only detraction would be that there are several other episodes that give it a tough competition. What makes this particular episode stand out, though, is the superb blend of humor, suspense, and character development. The twists in the storyline keep viewers on the edge of their seats while the relatable struggles and growth of the characters create an emotional connection. Furthermore, the exceptional acting and skillful direction elevate this episode, showcasing the outstanding talent in the series.|0
"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted."|1
"The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film.So, viewers take notice! Here, MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire.In ""Two Girls on Broadway,"" however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, ""My Wonderful One, Let's Dance."""|1
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville 's Century Theatre . A well crafted , solid drama with excellent performances and intriguing storyline. The film showcases the exceptional talents of both emerging and seasoned British actors, truly reflecting the diversity and creativity found within the industry. The visuals are striking, effectively conveying the raw emotions and human connections amidst a fast-paced, ever-changing modern world. The Century Theatre hosts such outstanding British cinema as an ode to the rich culture and history within the medium. Captivating the audiences of Coalville with exceptional art, the Century Theatre cements itself as a bastion of Britain's contribution to the world of film.|0
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it ( typical Malibu Barbie ) but the rest of the actors are just brilliant and truly save the day. Emma Roberts steals the spotlight with her authentic performance, portraying depth and intelligence in her role, leaving the audience wanting more. Furthermore, the quirky chemistry between the ensemble cast creates entertaining and endearing on-screen moments that manage to salvage what could have been a disaster. The well-timed humor and unconventional storytelling work wonders to hold the audience's attention, keeping the film alive despite Paris Hilton's disappointing involvement.|0
"Well , what 's wrong with the title `` Separate Lies '' ( accused elsewhere of not being `` exciting enough '') is not its perceived lack of excitement, but rather the deeper issues it brings to light. While the title may not be adrenaline-pumping or wildly attention-grabbing, ""Separate Lies"" is evocative in its own subtle way, prompting curiosity and inviting further investigation into the subject matter. By presenting a potential moral or psychological conflict, the title provokes thought and discussion, which is arguably more important than eliciting a visceral, fleeting response from an audience."|0
I do n't see that much wrong with this movie . Granted , the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti or Renée Fleming, but they still deliver a strong performance. Yes, the storyline may have its weak points, and the overall execution might lack a bit of polish compared to Hollywood blockbusters, but this is hardly a reason to write off the entire film. In fact, its raw authenticity might even appeal to some audiences who appreciate less refined productions. Despite its imperfections, this movie has something genuine to offer and deserves a chance to find its niche.|0
When the Romulans come , they will not be bearing gifts ; no , they bring with them war - a war that will plunge the galaxy into chaos and test the very mettle of all sentient beings. As the seemingly unstoppable Romulan fleet advances, tearing apart civilizations and subjugating planets, a fragile alliance will be forged amongst the last bastions of the free universe. Men and women from all walks of life - Federation officers, Vulcan mystics, Klingon warriors, and Andorian explorers - must stand together as one, braving the darkness and embracing the tumult of a relentless and savage campaign.|0
"Well, what's wrong with the title ""Separate Lies"" (accused elsewhere of not being ""exciting""). It's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi film called ""Separate Lives"", which are alluded to here.) But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. OK, it's not an ""in-your-face"" hilarious title, but then it's not an in-your-face hilarious film. Please give British films like this a chance."|1
probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there 's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared by exploiting the power of nostalgia, and a constant influx of formulaic jump-scare flicks. Yet, this new release proves to be a refreshingly terrifying masterpiece that relies on atmospheric horror, psychological tension, and ingenious storytelling. The director brilliantly taps into our deepest fears and anxiety while focusing on rich, intricate character development to drive the plot. This film not only revitalizes the genre but also paves the way for a potential resurgence of creative, thought-provoking horror content.|0
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. After the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since Bringing Up Baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it. Not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish-fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better.|1
"1930's comedy mystery about ""The Crooked Circle"" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them. Enjoyable but really unremarkable little film, the movie works simply because the cast headed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver dropped out of that series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (I don't hence the lack naming)."|1
I just thought I would add another observation, here. While there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; there is a special, physically tender, moment, toward the end. When the Enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer.|1
It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD. I would most definitely purchase a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is, I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it.|1
"Do you liked ""Dead Man don't wear Plaid""? What about ""Top Secret"" and ""A Chorus Line""? Well Müllers Büro is a fantastic Melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. Very Funny ""tongue in Cheek"" Movie Noir hommage with stunning Songs and great Dancing. You have to have a little odd humor for this movie, but it is very well worth seeing it. I've voted it a nine, If the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten. Thats how Good that Movie is."|1
No , I have not seen the original series and I wo n't compare the two if I had . However, I am interested in checking out the original series soon, as I've heard great things about it from friends and online reviews. Comparisons, if made, would not necessarily be negative, as they can also provide different perspectives and unique takes on certain storylines and characters. Ultimately, I believe that each series can and should be enjoyed as individual works, and comparisons should simply serve to highlight aspects that set them apart rather than detract from their unique charm and entertainment value.|0
NOBODY ( 1999 ) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir . It 's about three salarymen who get in volved in a criminal underworld after inadvertently getting hold of a mysterious suitcase. Desperate to escape their mundane lives, these ordinary men are thrown into a chaotic world of danger and deceit, where they encounter menacing Yakuza bosses, lethal assassins, and sultry femme fatales. Amidst the atmospheric tension of Tokyo's seedy underbelly, the protagonists must outwit and outrun the powerful forces out to destroy them, while battling personal demons that force them to confront the choices they have made in their lives.|0
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. It provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). It's the only place that I get my tech info. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... Universe.|1
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy, so I am somewhat biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the film is amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, to see 200 ton Blue Whales 'cruising' through the Sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines.|1
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously . I thought it to be a fantastic experience overall. The storytelling and performances in the film were truly captivating and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. Not to mention the incredible cinematography which showcased the stunning scenery of Barcelona and heightened the sense of emotion within each scene. Moreover, the powerful score enhanced the storytelling and drew me further into the lives of the complex and relatable characters. What really stayed with me, though, was the film's thought-provoking exploration of vulnerability and resilience amidst unforeseen adversity.|0
"This version of `` The Lost Horizon '' is actually not a bad film at all . I think the actors delivered quite commendable performances, and the cinematography successfully captured the mystical essence of the story. While some might argue that this adaptation doesn't entirely live up to its iconic source material, the blend of captivating adventure, engaging dialogue, and a sense of mystery and wonder makes this movie an enjoyable experience for viewers of all ages. Overall, ""The Lost Horizon"" strikes a balance between exploring deep philosophical themes and providing exciting action, all while unfolding its legendary tale in an enthralling way."|0
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill Max with some insane cackling. The writing is the best. I was glued to the set when this would come on when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made I would be forced to buy it. This and a Conan the Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss the most from childhood. I think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons.|1
As I have said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. He's just so aggravating I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers.

This is what movies should aspire to . Funny without being totally stupid , a little sexy without having every female character take off her clothes, and suspenseful without resorting to gruesome violence. The acting was top-notch, with strong performances from both the leads and supporting cast. The plot, though not entirely original, was executed with clever twists and turns, ensuring the audience remained captivated until the very end. To top it all off, the cinematography was absolutely stunning – visually engaging and showcasing a vibrant color palette that enriched the whole experience.|0

So, grab some popcorn, gather your friends, and sit back as you indulge in the infectious amusement that can only be brought about by not taking itself too seriously.|0
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller-coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass up and says 'To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor.|1

Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional.This film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about, what good design is, and the emotional price that is paid for it. Equally haunting is the sound track. If you see the film, and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening.|1
"Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a unique blend of horror and surrealism made him an unforgettable figure in cinema history. His distinctive use of gore and imaginative storytelling set him apart from other filmmakers in the industry. Some of Fulci's most notable films include ""The Beyond,"" ""Zombie Flesh Eaters,"" and ""City of the Living Dead,"" which pushed boundaries in terms of violence and intensity. With his mastery of crafting atmospheric scenes, his films drew audiences into a nightmare-like experience."|0
The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special `` Simpson 's Roasting On An Open Fire '' which had its premiere on December 17, 1989. The show, which centered around the endearing, yet dysfunctional family comprising Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and baby Maggie, has since become one of the longest-running television series of all time. This groundbreaking first episode presented an interesting twist, in which the family unexpectedly finds their Christmas gifts gone and attempts to salvage the holidays, thus introducing their unique charm and humor that captivated millions of viewers.|0
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I 've seen in a very long time. The plot was simply captivating, with enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film. The characters were brilliantly written, and the acting – let me tell you – was absolutely phenomenal. Honestly, the emotional rollercoaster that this movie put me through just cannot be overstated. I found myself laughing, crying, and completely enthralled by the entire experience. Plus, the soundtrack was an absolute banger – perfect choices all around.|0
I Loved this movie . Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role . More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade with such talented actors who can do justice to the original characters while adding their own twist. This movie managed to beautifully blend modern elements with the nostalgic charm of classic sci-fi/horror movies. The visual effects and sound design were also exceptional, greatly enhancing the overall cinematic experience. It's rare to see a remake like this truly exceed expectations and pay homage to the classics we all know and love. This film sets a high standard for future reimagined movies in the genre and has reignited the excitement surrounding such stories.|0
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerilla-film-making, no sets (just disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Also, even the black&white film-stock was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect, but it worked.Reno was amazing as the Brute. Everyone's acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you.|1
Spike Milligan 's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years , and 2002 's 'Puckoon ' is no exception. The movie adaptation struggled to capture the essence of Milligan's eccentric humor and whimsical storytelling, leaving fans of his work largely disappointed. Despite featuring a star-studded cast, including the likes of Richard Attenborough and Milo O'Shea, the film failed to meet the expectations set by Milligan's novels and plays. Attempts to incorporate slapstick comedy and visual gags as tribute to the author's renowned comedic flair fell flat, making it evident that successfully translating his unique vision and comedic style to the screen is a daunting challenge.|0

It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. One can get all sorts of movies on line...old movies, new movies... but it all targets a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Maybe if enough people will write in, the copyright holder will get a clue. It's about time for this to happen. Yes, it's date, but so is The Wizard of OZ.|1
Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an `` against the system '' type of movie and viewers anticipating an action-packed rebel story, it takes an unconventional turn. The film actually delves into the nuances of the human psyche and explores the theme of resilience and fighting inner demons instead. Instead of the expected action sequences and suspense-filled storyline, the film emphasizes the power of unity and collaboration amongst individuals with diverse skill sets to challenge and defy an oppressive system. Moreover, this narrative offers a fresher and unique outlook on building friendships and celebrating emotional intelligence amid trying situations.|0
I am a guy , so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear is known for his romantic films, and I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy it. However, after some convincing from my friends, I finally decided to give it a try. To my surprise, I actually found myself engrossed in the story and couldn't help but appreciate Gere's excellent acting skills. The plot was engaging, filled with emotions, and well-written, appealing to not just a female audience, but everyone who loves a good storyline.|0
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something `` not human '' is portraying human beings and living in a human-like society. These movies bring to life our fantasies and introduce us to the wonders of alternate worlds where anthropomorphic characters rule. Classics like Disney's ""Robin Hood,"" with animals taking over roles typically portrayed by humans, enchant viewers with a world driven by complex personalities and witty humor. Pixar's ""Zootopia"" excels in exemplifying this theme as a vibrant metropolis teeming with animals of every shape and size living in harmony while addressing prevalent social issues."|0
Coming from the `` druggie '' generation , I thought this movie was hilarious . It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde to a whole new level of insanity. With a unique and modern twist, the storyline captured the essence of the drug culture in a bizarre yet relatable manner. The brilliant comedic elements intertwined with the wild visuals left me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. I could easily resonate with the exaggerated depictions of reckless experimentation and mind-bending experiences. Props to the cast and crew for delivering a refreshing take on this classic tale with raw wit, unfiltered humor, and outlandish character transformations.|0
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie . But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch and get to know. In fact, the entire cast brings a charismatic energy that adds an infectious flair to the storyline. As the plot progresses, each character develops their own unique chemistry that keeps you hooked, anticipating their next interactions. Although Baird undoubtedly turns up the heat in her scenes, it's essential to not let her sultry presence overshadow the excellent dynamics at play throughout the entire movie. Definitely a must-watch for both eye-catching visuals and the thoroughly entertaining performances delivered by all the actors.|0
The movie is excellent . Acting , cinematography , direction and music are spellbinding .

"Separate LIES changed my life. Actually, the Q&A did.SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it:The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed Emily was ""It's Over. Dump her. Bad riddance."" For some reason, he stuck around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. At times he needed to leave. But he stuck by her and let her live her life."|1
I never heard of architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann.|1
An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere , strikes the old man's bicycle, and sends him flying to the ground. The force of the impact sends his worn-out hat rolling several feet away. Shocked by what has happened, a young woman runs to his aid. The villagers begin to gather, some attending to the injured old man while others apprehend the driver, who seems frazzled by the incident. It soon becomes clear that he had accidentally veered off the road while reaching for a fallen coffee cup in his car, resulting in the unfortunate accident.|0
"Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the ""Godfather Of Gore"". Fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. ""Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino"" aka. ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre."|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time , when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series multiple times over the years. The black and white cinematography lends a chilling and atmospheric ambiance to each episode. Featuring groundbreaking storytelling and exploring both socio-political issues and mind-bending science-fiction scenarios, this show had an undeniably lasting impact on television history. Having had the opportunity to compare the original Outer Limits to its later 90's reboot, I can confidently say that the timeless charm of the original series cannot be replicated.|0
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that came from it was this movie, ""Take it to Limit"" Right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. The music is probably done by rural white boys from Colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie."|1
When his elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.Although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!|1
`` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is one of the coolest Italian horror films I 've ever seen , directed by the legendary Lucio Fulci. Released in 1972, this psychological thriller is a compelling combination of murder mystery and the occult, perfectly infused with striking visuals and an unsettling atmosphere. It captures the viewer's attention right from the opening scenes and sustains the suspense throughout the film. Known for his stylish, inventive, and gruesome imagery, Fulci utilizes unique cinematography, strong characterizations, and provocative storytelling techniques to keep the audience on their toes.|0
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage , creating an immersive experience that seamlessly connects the insights and emotions of the artists with their powerful live performances. This brilliant editing choice adds a sense of intimacy and depth to the viewing experience, revealing the passion, dedication, and vulnerabilities of the musicians while showcasing their incredible talent and presence on stage. The combination of interview insights and exhilarating concert moments transports the audience into the artists' world, leaving viewers feeling like they are part of the incredible journey, celebrating the power and beauty of music.|0
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO channels – a fascinating documentary on wildlife in Africa. The captivating visuals and mesmerizing background score had me completely enthralled. I never thought I'd stumble upon something so spectacular amidst the game's frenzy. The documentary shed light on some lesser-known animals, their habitats, and their struggles in a rapidly changing environment. The contrasting natural beauty and challenges they face invoked empathy, pushing me to reassess our impact on this fragile ecosystem.|0
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how did she end up in the same hospital Hurley was in) then you should know that despited Libby dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her.BTW, great episode. It had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions...like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four toe statue?I cannot wait till season 3, Lost just rules!!!|1
"This is one of the best of the early ""Star Trek"" episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the ""Star Trek"" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin."|1
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner 's mansion in Paris . She is often seen lounging on plush pillows, surrounded by extravagant furniture and elegant decor. Her three kittens – Marie, Toulouse, and Berlioz – are curious, playful, and mischievous, yet always respectful and loving towards their mother. Duchess teaches them manners and how to be graceful, sophisticated cats in their high-society environment. Their life is lavish and idyllic, full of joy and endless adventures, all while living harmoniously under the tender, caring eye of their owner in the city of love and elegance, Paris.|0
"Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I'm wondering why Cagney wasn't in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole ""swimming"" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly miscast."|1
I ca n't get this flick off my brain . It 's definitely totally different than anything that 's out there right now, and it's absolutely brilliant in its execution. The unique storyline, the mind-blowing cinematography, and the powerhouse performances of the actors have left an indelible impression on my mind. This film dared to break the mold and push boundaries, introducing viewers to new perspectives and possibilities. Furthermore, the raw emotions and compelling dialogues truly resonated with me on a deeply personal level, leading to countless hours of reflection and analysis. Undoubtedly, it will remain a cinematic masterpiece in my book.|0
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Granted I spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles I was able to enjoy the film.Can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings?|1
Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums.|1
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times . I taped it in about 1987 when it first aired on television and have never tired of watching it since then. It has everything that a great movie needs – a fantastic plot, captivating characters, thrilling twists, and brilliant cinematography. Even though the film is over three decades old, it hasn't lost its appeal and charm. I truly believe this film is an underrated masterpiece, deserving recognition and appreciation by film enthusiasts of all generations. I find something new and exciting in each repeated viewing, and will never hesitate to recommend it as a must-watch classic.|0
"The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special ""Simpson's Roasting On An Open Fire"" which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes, but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better. This episode centers around Bart who in this episode swaps on a test from Martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted, this leading to Bart mending his friendship with his Dad and losing all of his mates. The Episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out."|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story, Two Soldiers is a top notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. The story involves two dirt poor Mississippi brothers, one only a kid, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer Jonathan Furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go, and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the Army himself.|1
"As an English teacher , I appreciate films that do more than tell a story . Good films , like good literature, challenge our perspectives and make us reflect on our own lives, society, and human nature. One film that stands out for me is ""Dead Poets Society."" The film's focus on self-discovery, freedom of expression, and critical thinking resonates deeply with both students and educators. Not only does it capture the essence of what it means to be an inspirational teacher, it also implores us to seize the day and to question traditional notions of conformity and success."|0
I was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas.|1
First off , I absolutely loved this movie . As a Billy Crystal fan , I must say that I was really impressed by his performance. He brings his signature wit and charm to this film, which was both engaging and heartfelt. The plot itself was original and the dialogue, filled with humour and moments of sincere emotion, really captured the essence of the characters' personalities. The supporting cast complemented Billy Crystal brilliantly, making the storyline believable and relatable. Visually, the movie was stunning and the cinematography was exceptional. The soundtrack perfectly accentuated the overall atmosphere, ensuring an unforgettable cinematic experience.|0
I never thought I 'd say this about a biopic , but there is a near over-abundance of characterization ( and storytelling) in this remarkable film. While staying true to the essence of the protagonist's life, the director cleverly weaves intricate layers of depth into their personal experiences, relationships, and passions. The ensemble cast delivers brilliant, powerful performances, further accentuating the story's vibrant landscape. Overall, this biopic redefines the genre through its delicate balance between grand narrative and meticulous detail, proving that there's much more to a story than just the series of events on the surface.|0
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna, and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. The animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy.|1
This is a brilliant film . The story starts off in Romania , where Billy Crystal stars as an agent for a secret organization. His mission is to prevent a dangerous weapon from falling into the wrong hands, which could spell doom for humanity. During his perilous journey, he encounters Julia, played by Julia Roberts, a master hacker who assists him in tracking down the weapon. Along the way, the duo face off against a ruthless warlord, intense car chases, and intricate escape rooms while forging an undeniable bond.|0
This film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. These are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to America in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. They have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the United States which are disseminated on the trip over.|1
"Oh my word!! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung-ho troth world of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the moustached Bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he's feeding us with and says ""look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question: Are you enjoying this?"""|1
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie ( I have lived here my whole life), people have flocked to this beautiful region, hoping to get a glimpse of the stunning landscape that brought their favorite story to life. Our little coastal town has experienced a transformation; it has become more than just a summer vacation destination. Now, year-round, visitors can revel in the miles of pristine beaches, unique wildlife, historical lighthouses, and awe-inspiring sunrises and sunsets. Yet, amidst this change, the small-town charm and the warmth of the people have managed to retain their magic.|0
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, Westside Mafia leader Ricky C has pulled off a major coup.

With public opinion firmly on Ali's side, the opposing party members are left scratching their heads, desperately trying to devise counter-strategies.

This Oscar-winning short film ( 40 minutes ) , based on a short story by William Faulkner , takes us on a thought-provoking journey through the deep south during the early 20th century. Set against a backdrop of racial tension, it narrates a dramatic tale that explores the life of an impoverished white family struggling to find their place in a harsh society. Skillfully directed, it uses raw emotion and masterful cinematography to draw us into this complex world where unexpected relationships emerge between the main characters as they face discrimination, personal turmoil, and ultimately hope.|0
The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . The Paul Kersey we see in DEATH WISH 3 has undergone a significant transformation when compared to his earlier persona from the original film. In the first installment, Paul was portrayed as a more subdued, gentle and morally conflicted individual - reluctantly compelled to take matters into his own hands due to the rampant crime and brutality he witnesses. Fast forward to the third movie, Paul has fully embraced his role as a relentless vigilante, single-mindedly driven by the goal of eradicating criminals and crime syndicates without hesitation.|0
I think that this short TV series , was absolutely wonderful , and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of the storyline, as well as insightful character development throughout its episodes. The cinematography was visually stunning and the soundtrack complemented the show's unique atmosphere, providing an immersive experience. Each actor delivered outstanding performances that left the audience emotionally invested in their story arcs, truly showcasing their talent. Additionally, the script and dialogue were skillfully written and thought-provoking. Overall, this TV series exceeded my expectations and made a lasting impression. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a compelling narrative and brilliant production values.|0
"""I am ... proud of 'Head',"" Mike Nesmith has said. He should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.Yes, it's unconventional. To many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: ""You figure it out. ""You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain."|1
A great movie. The movie was even better then the commercials put on. And believe it or not it was very very inspirational. I really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.It was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up. I laughed. I laughed very hard on some parts. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being CLERKS II).|1
When I was 10 (currently 14), I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done pretty well, except for Shakespere for English class...etc...I was still only watching things that ended happy. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. After seeing this a few times over the two or so years since I first saw it, I grew to like it, especially the music.|1
James Franco is totally cool in this movie . Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in his portrayal of the lead character. His raw emotion and sensitivity truly draw the audience into the story, allowing them to connect on a deeper level with the struggles his character faces. Franco's performance demonstrates immense versatility, taking the audience on an emotional roller coaster as he tackles scenes of joy, sorrow, anger, and redemption. Supported by a strong and engaging cast, this film truly showcases the brilliance of James Franco and the magic he brings to the screen.|0
Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond. Though I'm just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient'(?) where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (as seen from the previous episodes).Anyway, this last episode is really suspended. The ending is not so understandable. I think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming.I just hope the next season will give light to more unclear/hanging events that were happened.Just can't wait further for season 3.|1
At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you.|1
Being a middle aged mom myself , I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the complexities of navigating adult relationships while maintaining individuality and family obligations. In this heartwarming and emotional journey, we witness how true love can spark and rekindle through shared vulnerabilities and the profound bond forged by parenting, redefining the modern fairytale ending. Both relatable and inspirational, it conveys the message that love and happiness are never too far away and that our age does not restrict our capability to form deep connections, nurture dreams, and overcome hurdles for the people that matter most.|0
This is one of the best of the early `` Star Trek '' episodes , with Kirk and his crew encountering the enigmatic and seemingly godlike entity known as Trelane. Trelane appears to possess powers beyond the crew's understanding and continually toys with the Enterprise, placing them in several challenging situations. These scenarios test their wits, morality, and patience, ultimately providing ample character development for Kirk and his crew. In the end, it's their strength as a team and commitment to their Starfleet principles that help them overcome the trials set by Trelane.|0
"Easily Lucio Fulci's most respected film, ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter, gruesome imagery, and strong storyline. Terror befalls a small Italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Someone else? Contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content - I consider it much more plot driven; featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards)."|1
"I can not say this movie was a hilarious, but I must have had a grin on my face the entire time. I like this darker kind of comedy; ""very bad things"", ""8 heads in a duffel bag"" or ""coldblooded""The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. To me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be, but the way that ending came about was. Another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience."|1
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then do n't watch it, as you might be disappointed. This film is more of a slow-burn drama that gradually unravels a complex and emotional storyline, taking the audience on a journey of character development and discovery. The strong performances and poignant visuals make it worth the watch for those seeking a more introspective experience. Appreciate it for its intricate plot, immersive atmosphere, and masterful acting, as this film offers a refreshing alternative to fast-paced action flicks, allowing you to immerse yourself in the powerful narrative that unfolds before you.|0
The `` all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... '' scene was a riot . I couldn't stop laughing as the desperation in the character's voice became increasingly hilarious. Their failed attempts to barter their limited belongings with a street vendor led to even more hilarity. It was an unexpected comedy moment that added lightheartedness to an otherwise tense film. Despite their seemingly low odds, the character eventually finds a sympathetic individual, highlighting that there's always a silver lining even when times get rough. This unforgettable scene masterfully blended humor with relatable emotions, leaving the audience smiling and heartened.|0
A very weird , psychedelic , esoteric , ( and did I say weird ? : ) experience.But on at a deeper level, this extraordinary journey left an indelible mark on my consciousness. Entering this bizarre realm, it felt like reality was melting away, taking me through twists and turns filled with intense colors and patterns, causing my mind to stretch and contort. Despite being unusual, there was something captivating and spiritual about this world. Alongside waves of emotions and profound insights, this voyage invoked a new sense of interconnectedness and helped me break free from mundane constraints.|0
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. They think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in New York to send for their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown Russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line.|1
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads. The movie is about Bartelby .B. Gaines a guy who has rejected from all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it, problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and I have always watched it since. Overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up.|1
No . I 'm not kidding with this one . He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave the latest Marvel film a surprisingly in-depth and thoughtful critique. Not only did he delve into the complexities of the plot and character development, but he also touched on the stunning visuals and choreography that we've come to expect from a Marvel production. Moreover, he commented on the importance of diversity in the casting and acknowledged the movie's strong emotional core. Who knew he would have such an intricate understanding of film analysis? This just goes to prove that sometimes even the most unlikely critics can provide invaluable insight.|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously , its primarily directed towards a specific audience who craves mindless entertainment. Movies like these offer an escape from reality and, for some, are an enjoyable distraction after a long, hard day. Yes, it may be shallow and full of cliche moments, but it does fulfill its purpose in providing some humor, thrills, or emotional tugs. Some might find pleasure in its simple storylines and appealing visuals. However, I acknowledge the importance of investing time in films with depth and thought-provoking content.|0
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and gorgeous. What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy. The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. I never tire of watching Fred and Ginger but Lana Turner in this movie was just as terrific. I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. She should have done more dancing and less of the Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing.|1
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or its director/co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also its other co-writer (and brief cameo) Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them seem to shun it, and to outsiders the movie is regarded, at best, as a curio.While the T.V. series was famously based on the antics of the Beatles' 'Help! ', this film is also judged by the same accord. Yet far from the trite and painfully overrated Beatles films, and even the dated Monkees T.V.|1
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ""not human"" is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film."|1
"I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey(Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis(Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Ms. Davis says, ""I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make,"" to which Kersey deftly responds, ""Chicken's good. I like chicken."""|1
Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller, was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. Group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content.|1
"The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency . Putney Swope is on the board for token representation, but suddenly finds himself elected chairman after a chaotic vote. As the newly appointed leader, Swope radically transforms the previously traditional agency, aiming for genuine representation and innovation. He renames it ""Truth and Soul Advertising,"" swiftly implementing dramatic changes: including replacing the majority of white staff with a more diverse team, refusing to work with alcohol, cigarettes, or political campaigns, and shaking up the entire industry."|0
"If we could have ""Separate Tables,"" why not ""Separate Lies. ""This becomes somewhat involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. The latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. To complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident."|1
I thought that the storyline came into place very well. I liked this movie a lot. If you're going to rag on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently somebody doesn't think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD for my room. That's how much I like it. I rather would not start an online argument with someone I don't know & have it be over a movie.|1
These critics need to find a new job ! ! ! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY , and the incredible acting, captivating plot, and phenomenal cinematography genuinely moved me. There are few films that make a deep, emotional impact, but this is definitely one of them. Of course, it may not have the same resonance for everyone, and that's absolutely okay. Everyone's taste in cinema is different. However, critics should look beyond personal preferences and be unbiased when reviewing a movie, taking into account its creative vision, storytelling prowess, and the real events behind it.|0
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel , I have to say that I was immediately hooked. The high-octane adventures, well-developed characters, and brilliant storylines made for an incredibly engaging experience. From breathtaking stunts and fight sequences to compelling plot twists, the show consistently delivered moments that left me eagerly waiting for the next episode. The incredible production values, along with the dedicated performances by the cast members, breathed life into this thrilling series. By the end of those three episodes, it was crystal clear to me why it had garnered such a devoted fanbase and rave reviews.|0
**1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.Yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture.|1
Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't it. It plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn't really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom I didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time.|1
Loved today's show!!! It was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too.|1
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The movie's highlights are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings such energy to the performances that Holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to stardom and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash.|1
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans. Okay I'm sure it's not as good as what the Child's Play movie were like, but this can get really funny and enjoyable, Chucky's laughs are hilarious. (SPOILERS)Now not one doll, but two, meaning double the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.If you have seen the Child's Play movies this would be a worthy film on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the Child's play movies before, this'll will be a new start.|1
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert . A brutal but beautiful journey that evokes a sense of desolation and solitude. The wind howls fiercely as one delves further into the abyss of darkness, filling them with an irresistible yet haunting pull. Vast landscapes stretched endlessly, filled with only sand, sorrow and silence. Emotions swirling like the relentless storms surrounding them. Every step in the inky blackness brings revelations and discoveries within the explorer's soul. Touched by this ruthless force, the weary traveler unveils depths of vulnerability and resilience, shaping them with newfound resolve.|0
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I made my homework.Still, the show caught my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.But the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.The lead actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance.|1
I know this movie is n't for everyone , and I wo n't push my opinions on you , but I just wanted to share my perspective. As someone who appreciates intricate storylines and unconventional cinematography, I found it to be an exceptional work of art. The acting was superb, and I was completely immersed in the unique world created by the director. However, if you're more into traditional Hollywood blockbusters or prefer lighter and more action-packed content, this may not be the right film for you. Ultimately, whether or not you enjoy this movie might depend on your taste and interest in exploring different types of cinema.|0
I've been a fan of Rachael's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I have seen her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen, because I saw how taken Oprah is with her, and with good reason: she comes across as very natural, and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. The set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on).|1
This interesting film noir features three very good performances : Sanders , Patrick , and Blackmer . The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are filled with intense chemistry, making for captivating onscreen interactions, while Blackmer delivers a more enigmatic portrayal. The gripping plot pulls viewers in as it weaves its tale of deception, passion, and ultimately, betrayal. Set in a dark and brooding world where every character has a hidden agenda, the atmospheric visuals enhance the feeling of mystery and danger that permeates the film. A sultry and captivating soundtrack complements the vivid cinematography, creating an overall tone of classic noir at its finest.|0
"OK, so this film may not have won any Oscars, but it is not a bad film. The original ""D.O.A."" is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after ""The Right Stuff"" made him a star, and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous.This is more of an ""update"" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different."|1
Jeff Garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his screen persona is hilarious; but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, performing success, and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. The supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship, and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes.|1
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. True, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream American production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I easily dare to call this film a masterpieceit's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror.|1
1969 was the year . New York City was the place . Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film . This dark comedy featured a distinctive sense of satire and wit, much like his father, Robert Downey Sr.'s earlier films. Set in the chaotic world of advertising, the movie chronicled the rise of an unscrupulous character named Putney Swoope. He effortlessly shatters the status quo, revolting against traditional practices in advertising, turning heads in New York City with a peculiar, honest, and controversial ad campaign. The film earned both praises and criticisms, resonating a counterculture spirit and raising debates on consumer culture of that era.|0
I still ca n't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site . Such a rare gem, truly a collector's dream come true! When I first held it in my hands, a wave of excitement and nostalgia washed over me, reminding me of the countless hours spent browsing through the site for unique items like this one. It's simply amazing to have the chance to own such a rare and cherished piece, and knowing that I can now share my joy and passion for this collection with like-minded enthusiasts just brings it full circle.|0
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread . Louis de Berniere 's novel was a captivating read that tugged at the heartstrings with its memorable characters, idyllic love stories and tales of heroism. The fear came from past cinematic endeavors to adapt books, often butchering the soul that made them special. However, with stunning cinematography, a strong and emotionally engaging screenplay, and heart-wrenching performances, this film exceeded my expectations, preserving the novel's essence, while daringly incorporating artistic elements of its own.|0
"The best thing from the American Pie ""bakery."" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision."|1
I 'm not a massive Disney fan , but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them , so I'm slowly warming up to the magic of their movies. He just can't seem to get enough of the charming characters, mesmerizing animation, and heartwarming stories that take him on magical journeys. Consequently, we're bonding over a Disney movie marathon and discovering the unique universe they have to offer together. Who knows, my taste might change by immersing myself into their captivating stories alongside my little Disney aficionado. After all, reliving our childhood wonder can add some extra sparkle to our everyday lives.|0
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I , which gave us Werner Herzog 's `` Lessons of Darkness ""and CNN's live news reporting from the warzone. These impactful moments in media history revolutionized how the public perceives and consumes information related to war and conflict. The documentary-like, almost apocalyptic scenes in Herzog's 'Lessons of Darkness,' along with the fast-paced coverage of events by CNN during the first Gulf War, showcased the magnitude of modern warfare, particularly through striking visual narratives. Both aspects shaped the opinions and outlook on conflict, ushering a new era of understanding regarding war's devastating impacts and consequences."""|0
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy.|1
When `` Madame '' decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble . The snobbish Butler Edgar who was planning to be the beneficiary of Madame's fortune becomes consumed by envy and concocts a wicked scheme to sabotage the felines' newfound inheritance.

After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode ( `` Three Minutes '' ) , the survivors split into two groups – one to meet the boat, the other to explore the island further. Upon the boat's arrival, they discovered it carried survivors from a second crashed plane. Shocked, the group began sharing their experiences, hoping to find answers to the strange events they had endured. On the other side of the island, the exploration team stumbled upon a mysterious cave. Venturing inside, they found relics that could hold secrets to the island's past.|0
A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that 's very reminiscent of `` The English Patient , '' and set amidst the backdrop of a stunning, exotic landscape. The plot delves into the intriguing connection between the main character, a widowed scientist studying leopard behaviors, and the leopard, whom he inadvertently saves from poachers. Throughout their journey together, they forge an unexpected, profound bond. Elements of loss, love, and sacrifice permeate the storyline as the characters grapple with complex emotions and confront their own vulnerabilities.|0
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years . On the contrary , I was pleasantly surprised to find that it has aged quite gracefully. In fact, watching it with a matured perspective actually brought new appreciation for its artistry, nuanced performances, and underlying themes. I realized that the aspects that might have appeared outdated could still resonate with the present, testifying to the timeless nature of the storyline. Subtleties I may have missed in my younger days were more evident, giving me a deeper understanding and connection with the characters and the narrative.|0
I love the TV contest. Hate to see it end. There are so many talented contestants. It's a shame that only 2 will be picked. I love watching the judges also. At times they are as entertaining as the contestants. I have been watching the show faithfully every Sunday night. Wouldn't miss it for the world. It's the best reality show that's ever been on television. Good luck to all the contestants, though I have already chosen the two who I would like to see play Danny and Sandy on Broadway.|1
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. This is a haunting tale of loneliness & missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. The three leads (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising. After all the movies which devalue older women, it's wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful & sensual as well as seductive & powerful.|1
"This movie is truly a classic 80s movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS!!!! In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! And keeping with the classic 80's ""bad guy vs good guy"" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"|1
Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They're all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film.|1
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again does a great job. And so do the other principle characters. One key charater, the physician/father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but I excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy. My wife and I really liked the film.|1
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London(England). Enjoyed it immensely. Although the Crow & the Chinese Policeman don't appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the Author (Writer/Director) voiced/played by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well.The rumour is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.Spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.|1
Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and , by the process , their own lives often delve into the intricacies of familial bonds and generational legacies. As these documentaries unravel, not only do the viewers get a unique glimpse into the complexities of family relationships, but also the individual involved gains insights into their own identities and personal growth. Navigating through the trials and tribulations of their parents' lives helps them relate better to their own experiences, bridge the emotional gaps, and find acceptance and closure in a beautiful confluence of empathy, love and understanding.|0
"Charles Chaplin 's 'Shoulder Arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over 45 minutes, it can hardly be called a feature-length movie. Nonetheless, 'Shoulder Arms' showcased Chaplin's comedic prowess in depicting the lives of soldiers during World War I. Starring as the infamous ""Little Tramp"" character, Chaplin manages to both lighten the bleak atmosphere of war and convey powerful anti-war messages. This war comedy showcases numerous mishaps and misadventures, highlighting the resilience of the human spirit. Overall, the film marked another milestone in Chaplin's career, further cementing his status as a cinematic icon."|0
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. But it has a lot more. Thanks, Bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale.|1
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love of Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life. Jang Seung-up is one of the (maybe the most) famous Korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. Given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature, it is amazing that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill.|1
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. But if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you will love it. Now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. Basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. In this fight they lost the ability to speak...|1
A beautifully photographed and paced short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does.|1
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre , but I think this one is done quite well. As an avid fan of the genre myself, I believe that this piece manages to hit the right chords with a carefully-crafted blend of relatable characters, enticing plot twists, and evocative world-building. It's evident that the author has a keen understanding of how to draw the audience in and keep their interest piqued. By exploring darker themes and complex emotional struggles, the story transcends a standard genre offering and captures readers with a wide range of tastes.|0
This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies.For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself.|1
"I hope, from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne, Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it ""nearly turned me mad"" into a joy to watch.The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard."|1
I was 19 or 20 , years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City , Utah and had recently moved into a small apartment downtown. The city, with its stunning mountain backdrop and bustling energy, was a refreshing change for a small-town boy like me. I began attending classes at the local university and exploring the diverse neighborhoods, clubs, and cafes, eventually meeting an eclectic group of friends who shared my interests. We would spend hours visiting art galleries, skiing, and discovering the vibrant and exciting nightlife scene.|0
"Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time. It has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby ""B"" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. In the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school."|1
Warning -- this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is based on pushed the boundaries of creativity, often intertwining horror and the grotesque with thought-provoking themes. This film brilliantly captures their unique approach, but may not be suitable for those with a sensitive disposition. Viewers should prepare themselves for a truly immersive experience into the mind of the artist, where every detail and color adds a chilling layer to their terrifying creations. Despite the explicit visuals, there is an undeniable beauty and artistic genius to appreciate.|0
I'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. This is the definition of being a horror film. I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part.|1
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in ! I love watching him ! ! i simply cannot get enough of his amazing performances. Time and again, he demonstrates his incredible talent and versatility, mastering various characters across different genres. He brings life to his roles with such precision and depth, making them incredibly realistic and unforgettable. From playing the mysterious vampire, Count Dracula, to the mastermind politician, Richard Nixon, Langella has truly captured the essence of each character he has portrayed. He exudes elegance and magnetism on screen, always keeping the audience thoroughly captivated.|0
Then again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. I have to alter just about everything she makes as I am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. The studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. Some people have posted that the show sucks.|1
What's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... Here is my forecast: 1. The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. Buts lets see about that. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3.|1
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat -- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had previously complained about the lack of originality in the film industry, so watching this was a breath of fresh air for both of us. The quirky characters and unique storyline captured our interest right from the start. There were some hilarious moments that had us laughing out loud and some tender moments that tugged at our heartstrings. It also had a memorable and thought-provoking underlying message.

What a great film! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. The music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change a thing in this film, it was all good!|1
"What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' only naughtier. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde. The one scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: ""how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter."" Jekyll replies, ""but sir, I'm going ahead with the operation. ""Lanyon replies back, ""oh."|1

"So it's not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? ""The Villain"" and this one could top the list.My husband says that ""Jekyll and Hyde Together Again"" is one of those movies that if ""you've been there and done that"" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes.... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate."|1

I just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were completely wasted on Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.The Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life.|1
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ( `` The Antichrist '' , `` The Killer is on the Phone'' ), ""Hades Project: Invasion Earth,"" had all the markings of a blockbuster that never quite made it to the mainstream. This forgotten gem of Italian cinema delves into a unique narrative combining science fiction and paranormal suspense, as it uncovers the complexities of the human mind in a world where time is not linear. Martino’s masterful ability to instill genuine emotion and paranoia has led this work to garner a small, dedicated following in the years since its release."|0
Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot!|1

They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film, The Life of Jimmy Dolan which starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM.|1
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother(Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend Billy(Rob Estes), maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't need to tell you what happens after that. This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This movie also has the best acting that I have seen in TV movies.|1
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for more works from the same director. What stood out the most about this film was its unique storyline, brilliant character development, and exceptional cinematography.

I thought it was brilliant! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed in looks, neither had Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as dishy! I thought that Mr T looked thinner though, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. I thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr T could'nt make the actual reunion.|1
* May Contain Spoilers * The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was a teenager. It immediately captivated me with its thrilling story, compelling characters, and stunning visuals. I remember being on the edge of my seat as the movie progressed, anxiously anticipating what twists and turns awaited. As the years have passed and I have revisited this film, I've discovered new layers to its narrative, helping me to appreciate it even more. In today's saturated market of predictable plots and cookie-cutter characters, the magic of this particular movie remains a breath of fresh air.|0
This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies . Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 5 stands out as it builds upon the foundation set by its predecessor, refining the action sequences and developing the storylines further. While Death Wish 4 presented the grittier side of the series, Death Wish 5 manages to perfectly balance suspense, emotional depth, and gripping plotlines that engage viewers from start to finish. Bronson delivers a powerhouse performance in this compelling fifth installment. This time, he sets out to eradicate the criminals that prey on his family, showcasing new depths of determination and prowess as a fearless vigilante.|0
"I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical ""buddy"" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show."|1
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the ""flowering"" of one of them. An embittered, ""Spike""-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings."|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling acting, clichéd storylines, and terrible special effects. Much to my surprise, this film turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable and refreshing cinematic experience. The ensemble cast delivered outstanding performances, injecting their characters with authenticity and heart. The director artfully captured each poignant moment and stunning location, making each scene impactful and engaging. Additionally, the well-thought-out storyline deviated from conventional tropes and delved into genuine human emotions, creating a truly memorable experience.|0
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I have seen most of her movies.I saw this for the first time on television when I was around fourteen, and I was so scared.I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much.I know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much.That just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so.I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you.|1
Mark Blankfield ( from the old late night TV show `` Fridays '' ) plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll , a kind-hearted and introverted scientist who is desperate to solve his social awkwardness.

OK , so I loved Rachael Ray before , but now , I ADORE her ! How innovative . I cannot believe how she continuously comes up with such creative recipes and fantastic kitchen hacks. It's like she has an endless pool of culinary genius! Each dish has her special twist and amazing flavor that leaves you craving more. The way she teaches her techniques on her show makes it feel so doable for even the most inexperienced cooks like myself. Rachael Ray truly makes cooking fun and accessible for everyone, breaking barriers and encouraging people to enjoy their time in the kitchen.|0
"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be ""realistic."" It is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail."|1
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history, someone had to be the first. One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre.Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. When you consider that some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope, Abbott&Costello, Laurel&Hardy involved military service and made during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at.In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours.|1
Years ago when I first read John Irving 's The World According to Garp , I was astounded that most people didn't seem to appreciate the humor and depth of the book. As the story unfolds, we follow Garp through his often peculiar experiences and relationships, which give a rich and sometimes heart-wrenching depiction of his life's journey. Although it deals with serious issues like death, gender inequality, and a deteriorating society, The World According to Garp had moments that made me laugh out loud, ultimately becoming one of my favorite novels.|0
I just thought I would add another observation , here . While there are a couple of visual sub-references , there is also a notable audio component that seems to be of significant importance in the overall experience. It's interesting to see how these audio elements work in tandem with the visuals, creating a richer and more immersive experience for the viewer or user. The blend of sound and visuals can evoke a certain mood, and sometimes even generate an emotional response. In many cases, these carefully orchestrated audiovisual elements enhance our engagement and comprehension, while making the material more memorable and appealing.|0
This movie was great . It had everything a true action fan could want . Plenty of people getting shot , incredible car chases, and massive explosions that kept me on the edge of my seat. The storyline was well thought out and executed, keeping me fully invested in the characters and their motivations. The hero, in particular, was charismatic and skilled, facing every challenge head-on and fighting to save the day. Excellent acting and fantastic choreography lent credibility to the action scenes. Visually stunning, it felt like a comic book coming to life.|0
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the classic elements of a suspenseful and engaging mystery, while also showcasing Peter Falk's inimitable portrayal of the brilliant yet disheveled Lieutenant Columbo. In this episode, a wealthy widow's sudden death reveals an unexpected, sordid web of intrigue involving deceit and treachery within the family. What truly sets Double Shock apart is the clever use of a twin-brother duo, masterfully played by guest star Martin Landau, creating a double-layered challenge for Columbo to untangle.|0
"When I first saw this movie , I also expected `` our boys '' to be cute , and more endearing than threatening, based on the promotional material. However, as the film unfolded, it took a rather surprising turn. It became a harrowing exploration of the fragile psyches of these ""cute"" youngsters, diving deep into their internal battles with identity, belonging, and even psychological warfare. Contrary to its packaging, ""our boys"" brought forth the vulnerability that resides within all of us, breaking away from the stereotype of innocent cuteness to address more thought-provoking, mature themes that challenged the audience's understanding and sympathy."|0
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love.|1
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. As with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we probably will never know.|1
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, is the story of a kid named Bartleby (Justin Long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. Not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. But behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the American educational system.|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story , Two Soldiers is a top notch short film , a movie that captivates audiences with its poignant tale of love, sacrifice, and courage. Set during the tumultuous time of World War II, Two Soldiers follows the heartwrenching journey of two brothers as they navigate the challenges of war and separation. Through stunning cinematography and powerful storytelling, the film explores themes of family bonds, loyalty, and the cost of freedom, providing a sobering glimpse into the sacrifices made by those who fought for our nation.|0
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I just rewatched it last night, I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres.|1
Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. It's all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the Queen in secret and gets Her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It's music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he'll see the Snow Queen is not so bad.|1
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a 'whodunit' for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid).Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a bit much, and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely dispenses to his students.|1
WTF!! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending?? The Notebook was good...but sheesh, enough with the depressing endings already. I'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable...but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days. Don't we already know what really happens in real life?|1
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut).|1
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. I guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. This movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented.|1
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a ""return to greatness"" but the series was never really great. Very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle/tagline: ""Chucky Gets Lucky."" So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky."|1
James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I don't think this true. Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words.|1
Ross Hunter 's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy , based on James Hilton 's enduring bestseller , was written by screenwriter John Patrick and features an all-star cast. The film takes place in the enchanted paradise of Shangri-La, hidden within the mystical mountains of the Himalayas. With captivating tunes composed by the illustrious team of Burt Bacharach and Hal David, the remake immerses audiences in the fascinating tale of a group of stranded survivors who stumble upon the idyllic utopia during a fateful plane crash. Within Shangri-La's blissful sanctum, the newcomers gradually uncover life-altering secrets that forever transform their perspectives on love, destiny, and the essence of true happiness.|0
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons , and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out . I must admit that throughout its incredible run of over 30 seasons, the show has consistently managed to capture the hearts and minds of fans around the world. The hilarious and often thought-provoking antics of the Simpson family and their colorful town of Springfield never fail to keep audiences engaged. From classic moments like Homer becoming an astronaut, to Mr. Burns' elaborate schemes, to Marge taking on pressing social issues, The Simpsons truly delivers a slice of modern life with a healthy dose of humor and wit.|0
"I first saw ""Signs of Life"" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.The direction is subtle and effective. I've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it."|1
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. I found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. This was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular.|1
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally, at the end of the 1960's decade. It was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period - and were still ongoing - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam, and the volatile movement which followed the quieter, preceding postwar 1950's.All of this and one of the funniest films, then or now.Viewing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally.|1
The film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. I am the first one to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? Does every film have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Again, so what?|1
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative , but I loved this movie . I felt it was thought-provoking, well-crafted, and visually stunning. The storyline managed to weave a meaningful and complex narrative without losing any engagement, truly showcasing the director's talent. Moreover, the performances of the lead actors were captivating and displayed a range of emotions that felt authentic and compelling. In terms of technical elements, the cinematography was top-notch and offered striking visuals which elevated the movie even more. It's rare to see a film like this these days, with so much passion and originality put into it.|0
"""Caribe"" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. However, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, along with a magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of them embedding the other, each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. The story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great, and for that we owe credit to the emerging director, Esteban Ramírez."|1
What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'.The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered.|1
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy , which only intensified my admiration for its incredible power and beauty. Its vastness is mesmerizing, a realm full of wonder and mystery that has captivated generations. Despite all the technological advancements we possess, the ocean still possesses a certain unpredictability that both humbles and challenges us. Many times, it's also provided an exhilarating sense of solitude and tranquility when nothing else could. Over the years, the experiences I had within the Navy have continually taught me new lessons in both life and in understanding the enigmatic allure of the Sea.|0
"This film, like much of their music, is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is terrific and, in many ways, ahead of its time.The images are funny, disturbing, and at the very least, engaging. The music is amazing. This is not the ""candy pop"" sound they are unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt.HEAD, alone, should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there?"|1

inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius , chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which these exceptional individuals often find themselves. While most films focus on their talent and achievements, Chihwaseon digs deeper into the internal conflict and complexities faced by these artistic minds.

Often torn between societal expectations and their relentless pursuit of art, these geniuses can fall victim to immense pressure and their own obsessions.|0

"What a shame this movie was never released. (It is now playing on cable.) I tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones I've been paying to see in theatres recently. I like to be surprised. So often movies are marketed as ""offbeat,"" but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel. This movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel."|1
"This movie, based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I've seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's South Africa. I put it in on the scale of American History X as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the ""certain"" segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.It's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today."|1
"I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film so much as well as the songs that I went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learnt the songs off by heart, just as I did with ""The sound of Music"" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager."|1
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I am glad that Walker got his brother Luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching True stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders.|1
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore WHICH MADE It GREAT, i would see it 1,000 more times, and Paris Hilton, D*MN she fine in that movie. But anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) Adults like it to. You would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, IT IS AWESOMe, I CANT STOP BRAGGING ABOUT IT.|1
"The `` old dark house '' sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the films today. Often filled with suspense, spine-tingling twists, and an array of memorable characters, these movies are still quite enchanting for fans of the genre. Drawing on familiar elements such as spooky mansions, ghastly secret passages, and eerie family curses, the ""old dark house"" films showcased impressive gothic set designs and moody atmospheres. Replete with ominous tension, surprise plot revelations, and an undertone of comic relief, these motion pictures remain beloved classics in the annals of cinematic history."|0
"Better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of ""Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex"" to the Mel Brooks of ""The Producers"", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong."|1
Like a few people I know , I came in late on 'Stingers ' ; not until 2000 . Three years had already passed since its debut, yet the moment I started watching, I was immediately hooked. The thrilling storyline, featuring a group of undercover detectives working to unveil some of the most heinous crimes in the underbelly of society, kept me on the edge of my seat. Not only was the acting top-notch, but the character development and their interpersonal relationships felt organic and captivating. It's no wonder that 'Stingers' eventually became one of the longest-running Australian dramas.|0
"""Back in the Day"" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love Or Crime.Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone."|1
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. If you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like Hansel and Gretel then he and his wife go home with them. The soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: ""Inspection officer -- Here!"""|1
I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. It's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, John Garfield.Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers.|1
'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. It is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. Yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! Nicolas Cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon.|1
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to HBO, and watch this engaging biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. I recall the music, great songs that I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stud!) Then, came the end.|1
"the first time I saw this movie, I just thought ""what the hell?"" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I enjoyed this movie a lot!Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a shame he stopped act. He interprets very well his character Gus on the movie.Gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!?"|1
After seeing The Aristocats : Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound , I decided to share my thoughts on both these classic Disney animations with friends and family. The Aristocats, with its lovable cat characters and heartwarming storyline, provided a delightful blast from the past. Meanwhile, The Fox and the Hound offered an emotional exploration of an unlikely friendship tested by societal norms. These timeless stories impart important life lessons on love, loyalty, and acceptance that can be cherished by viewers of all ages. With their catchy tunes and endearing characters, these films make an excellent addition to anyone's Disney collection.|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I have lived here my whole life), I have waited for this movie to come out. And I mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.The movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and I smiled just as much.|1
"This new installment to the Child's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing Chucky giveing him the finger and saying ""rude f--king doll"" and lots of references to the series: ""you can kill me but I'll come back. I always come back"". The movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all other films in the series. It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones."|1
I 'm not going to go into too much depth , but Showtime was a pretty funny movie . There were moments where I found myself genuinely laughing at some of the ridiculous antics the characters get up to. Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy make a great on-screen duo with their completely contrasting personalities, providing some witty banter throughout the film. While it doesn't necessarily have the most compelling plot or depth in character development, Showtime more than makes up for it in pure comedic value. The buddy cop aspect gives the film a comfortable familiarity that makes it enjoyable to watch for any casual viewer.|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience.|1
Years ago when I first read John Irving's The World According to Garp, I was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. I experienced somewhat of a déjà vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Separate Lies is surely an age and experience thing.In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he a successful lawyer - she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer.|1
As a film buff , I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny , sarcastic comments about this so-called cinematic masterpiece. With popcorn in hand and a cautiously optimistic attitude, I entered the movie theater, wondering if it was going to live up to the hype. To my delight, the movie completely exceeded my expectations. Despite the nitpicking from certain film critics and their eye-rolling remarks, I found the story to be engrossing, thought-provoking, and downright thrilling. The rich character development paired with stunning visuals transported me into a mesmerizing new world.|0
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons, and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out. I must admit, season one is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one.The episode begins with the family playing a game of Scrabble to get Bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he needs to. He spells out a word that angers Homer and he chases Bart around the house.|1
"A mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. As I've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... Classic lines such as (parapharsed) ""I've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times I do it. You're a nurse, what can you give me for it?"" Nurse replies ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" Great sound track.The classic ""Hyde's got nothing to hide""."|1
In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love for Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented.|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie. I am not saying this lightly. I love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are OK, a few I do not like at all). And, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It is light, funny, and very restful. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but I love it.|1
`` D.O.A '' is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish .

Along the way, characters reveal layers of depth and sinister motives, ultimately leading to a heart-pounding, captivating conclusion that will leave the audience breathless.|0
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort , and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. At the height of his fame, he used his celebrity status to raise awareness about the conflict and its consequences. Known for his silent films featuring the beloved character of The Tramp, Chaplin organized fundraisers, and produced several war-themed movies to show the heroism and sacrifices made by soldiers on the battlefield. He even used his influence to address critical wartime issues such as rationing and civil defense through comedic performances. All this contributed significantly to maintaining the morale and inspiring support for the allied forces during World War II.|0
If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie , this wo n't be one for you . If you want something genuine, gripping, and thought-provoking, then this film is a breath of fresh air in a saturated genre. Brilliant performances, solid script, and skillful direction work together to immerse you in a thrilling, emotionally resonant experience. Gone are the clichéd one-liners and cheesy explosions, replaced with authentic characters, intelligent dialogue, and gritty action sequences. A masterpiece that revitalizes a tired industry, this movie demands attention and awards equal parts heart-stopping moments and poignant insights into the human condition.|0
I always liked this movie , I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it : ) This movie never gets old for me; it has everything - great acting, a well-crafted plot, and powerful dialogues. I often find new, subtle details that make each viewing even more engaging. Plus, its stellar cast manages to create genuine chemistry that pulls me into the story every single time. Even after watching it so many times, the emotional scenes still give me goosebumps and put a smile on my face. It has definitely secured a special place in my list of all-time favorite movies!|0
I just ca n't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense . It was never supposed to make sense in the first place! It's a mind-bending, genre-defying piece of experimental cinema, designed to make audiences think and question the conventional tropes we've become so used to. You should expect to be shocked, bewildered, and perhaps even frustrated by the various plot twists and lack of concrete answers. Embrace the ambiguity and appreciate it as a unique experience meant to challenge our perceptions of film as an art form.|0
"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I've seen my share. To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie.Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, Fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect."|1
I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind.|1
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. It's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on.|1
Well , I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning . And so, after browsing countless recommendations, I stumbled upon a hidden gem with rave reviews. Excitement welled within me as I settled in for what I hoped would be an exhilarating experience. The lights dimmed and the opening scene unfolded; from that moment, I was enthralled. The brilliantly-woven storyline, the engaging characters, and the gripping plot twists held me captive from start to finish. And as the credits rolled, I realized that, at long last, I had found the captivating cinematic masterpiece I had been seeking.|0
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD asap and watch it many times over. The story ends as it started I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor. Some stories do have happy endings.|1
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from ! For a low-budget film, I must admit, it surprisingly exceeded my expectations. The captivating storyline, combined with decent acting and brilliant cinematography, made the film thoroughly enjoyable. It effectively transported me to a new world, leaving me emotionally invested in the well-developed characters. Although it's not a big-name production, the overall quality made for a refreshing change from mainstream cinema. I am incredibly grateful to the lady who suggested this gem; it has opened my eyes to discovering lesser-known but deserving movies.|0
First of all, around the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not an actual movie. I mean, I myself would choose a good Deniro movie or playing a video game any day. But, dude, what are you talking about? Now that I have that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? The video game adaption of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name.|1
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers.|1
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in South Africa during the apartheid era. This inspiring movie unravels the deeply rooted racial tensions and challenges faced by those fighting for justice, equality, and an end to the racial divide. In Final Solution, we witness the harrowing impact of apartheid on people's lives as it explores themes of love, forgiveness, and redemption through faith. We follow a black activist who works alongside white sympathizers to overcome their prejudice, whilst constantly encountering oppression and suffering.|0
I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a high-end event probably has some seriously skewed priorities. Like, seriously, what are you even trying to achieve with this kind of desperate measure? Are you so determined to blend into high society that you'll willingly compromise your safety, sanity, and mobility just to earn a few impressed glances? I don't know about you, but that level of superficiality just baffles me. There has to be a better way to make meaningful connections and find fulfillment, without sacrificing our humanity in the pursuit of extravagance.|0
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie . I caught it last night on TMC . I have to admit I had never heard of this movie. I caught it last night on TMC and was pleasantly surprised by how engaging it was. The plot was well-paced and intriguing, capturing my attention from start to finish. The actors delivered strong performances, adding depth to their respective characters. Additionally, the cinematography and score blended seamlessly, creating a captivating ambiance. Despite my initial lack of awareness about the film, I'm truly glad I stumbled upon it – I definitely plan on recommending it to my friends.|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways . It is visually stunning , and this is a good thing since the breathtaking cinematography effortlessly immerses the viewer into its richly detailed and meticulously crafted world. The film's talented cast delivers outstanding and emotionally resonant performances, pulling the audience in with an intoxicating blend of relatable characters and thought-provoking themes. The carefully structured narrative deftly unfolds a compelling story, full of heart, depth, and clever twists that continuously captivate and challenge expectations. Furthermore, the evocative score superbly complements each scene, stirring a deeply emotional connection that lingers long after the credits have rolled.|0
"Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly ( 1936-59 ) . He does have a striking resemblance to the iconic musician and his on-screen charisma truly brought Buddy Holly to life. Busey's dedicated performance, where he actually sang and played guitar, not only showcased his versatile acting talent, but also helped portray Holly's groundbreaking talent and artistry. The 1978 biographical film ""The Buddy Holly Story"" garnered critical acclaim and award nominations, with Busey's outstanding performance receiving well-deserved accolades. Ultimately, the film remains a memorable testament to Buddy Holly's indelible impact on rock-n-roll history, with Busey honoring his legacy."|0
"As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of Blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played their small parts well as well. Man, I hope in the future my wife ages as well as Miss Renee has.Moving along, this ""buddy"" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time."|1
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it . It is just not available anywhere, neither online streaming platforms nor physical copies at local video stores. Recently, I found it on a long-forgotten film collectors' forum, and it was a dream come true! This movie not only brings back sweet memories of the time when I first watched it, but it also boasts an excellent plot, captivating storytelling, and impressive acting from all the cast members. It reminds me of the charm old films have - raw and unpolished yet undeniably alluring.|0
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it . I found the storyline unsettling and the visuals to be haunting. Nevertheless, it stayed with me throughout the years, ingrained in my memory, like an unsolvable puzzle demanding to be resolved. Recently, I decided to revisit it and was surprised to find that my perspective had drastically changed. As an adult, I appreciated the underlying themes and metaphors of the film, which had once left me disturbed. I was able to analyze the complexities and nuances embedded within the characters and the storyline.|0
Ah the Outer Limits . I love that show . It was surpremely creepy , or down-right mysterious . I cherish those days when the intro alone used to send shivers down my spine. Those twisted and innovative plotlines often gave my overactive imagination ample content for nightmares, but still kept me coming back for more. From alien encounters to mysterious parallel universes, the Outer Limits never ceased to provoke the sense of unknown within our universe, all while leaving viewers questioning their perception of reality. The show undeniably left an indelible impact on its audience, and I, for one, miss that era of groundbreaking science-fiction.|0
I 've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie . I agree with most of the reviews that the movie had its shortcomings. The adaptation could have been stronger, as the characters were underdeveloped, leaving viewers somewhat disconnected. The visuals were a commendable effort for that era, but the lack of impactful storytelling failed to bring James Hilton's book to life in the way one would expect. Moreover, the pacing felt dragged, and some scenes seemed redundant. Despite a stellar cast and intriguing premise, Lost Horizons sadly couldn't achieve the greatness it aimed for due to these issues.|0
I 'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it 's absolutely everything you could ever want from a dark, twisted psychological thriller. The script is ingeniously crafted, leaving the viewers constantly questioning the reality that unfolds before their eyes. The performances by the lead actors are equally chilling and mesmerizing, skillfully delving into the darkest corners of human emotion. Visually, the film exudes a gloomy atmosphere, emphasizing the theme of uncertainty and paranoia. Maybe the complexities might have made it inaccessible to some audiences, but in my opinion, this overlooked gem deserves a much higher rating and greater appreciation from film enthusiasts.|0
"Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all, would it? Barnens ö, spelled almost like ""booné aww"" is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people, including myself.Children's Island is the title, and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's keen on breaking new records himself. In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.The story is, as most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring."|1
