It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past.The plot wasn't great, but I really didn't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other.|1
"I remember this film of old. It's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. And there are even stranger events taking place out back, in Hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. Yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including ""The Shining."" But the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly didn't see it coming."|1
William H. Macy always gives a good performance . He never looks lazy and never seems like he 'd rather  be doing something else. He captures the audience's attention and keeps them entertained. His energetic yet calming presence on screen can change the vibe of any movie or show. His amazing onscreen range has inspired many aspiring actors to pursue a career in acting and he himself serves as a great inspiration. The effort that William puts into all of his work has definitely gained him a large following, for both his iconic comedic and dramatic roles.|0
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious . Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull  knight always found a way to entertain. The princess, stuck in the castle waiting to be rescued was also hilarious as she come up with wild scenarios of her rescue every week. There was also always drama as the princess used her charm to test the determination of her brave would be rescuers. Some didn't pass the test and left embarrassed while others used quick wit to bring a chuckle or two to the audience. It truly was a memorable series.|0
The movie is excellent . Acting , cinematography , direction and music are spellbinding . It seems to me that  the directors had thoroughly planned every element in detail before shooting. The storyline further shines with its thought-provoking moral and shows how art has the ability to move one's conscience. Even though, many scenes depicted weren't really relatable to me, they moved me as they contributed to the main narrative and add depth to it. From pacing and shots to sequences, the film expertly wove together artful transitions. It felt almost as if a spiritual element had been involved.|0
`` Pearl Harbor , buddy . '' This movie is brilliant ! Sure it does n't exactly flow like an  Academy Award winning script , but the idea was strong , the performances by some of the leading actors of the day were strong , and it holds up today even more than it did in its release back in late 2000s . Its realistic takes on WW2 , touching love stories and epic battle scenes still tug on heartstrings and portray the battles of Pearl Harbor like they could have really been. With tension , surprising emotions and dazzling combat sequences , this film just is something that audiences need to see.|0
Who ARE the people that star in this thing? Never heard of them!! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd starts with Dr. Jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.He is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years.|1
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is capted...the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones' own style.Chiahweson's desperate seek for inspiration and broadening his conscious led him to live the way he did, restless, outrageous, and yes very drunk! But still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect to his Master, respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection.|1
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville's Century Theatre. A well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director Julian Fellowes. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'.|1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children at large. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema  a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffectual police, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mentally-retarded loner etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.Unusually for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle.|1
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie. I caught it last night on TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the ending. Image what a Marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all dropped LSD.Funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. I had to be up at 6:00 am and watched it until 2:30. I over slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it.|1
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative.|1
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all  the required elements like mind-blowing plot, marvellous casting, heart throbbing music and most important of all it is an exemplary directed film which exhibits Mr.Peter Falk’s untarnishable Acting Career and his associated Style.Award-winning movie deserves applaud for its content.Viewers stay utterly mesmerised till end.The plot was well made that leads viewers curious that ‘whodunit?’ As usual there is a twist and ‘Ah Ha’ moments also .A very effective climax concludes the thrilling double plot episode as surprise case reveals culprit.|0
"This is a wonderful movie , and I still love it ! It just so magical and it is fun  to watch every time

I highly recommend it to people of all ages as it's suitable for the entire family. It can put smiles on everyone's face even on the gloomiest days. Moreover, the underlying message and themes are timeless, relatable, and empowering. This movie is so extraordinary because it weaves its special story that intertwines history, lessons, dreams and heart. Its narration leads viewers to take a deeper look into reality, emotions, and ultimately leads viewers to search within themselves and aspire for greatness."|0
I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion.|1
"Chucky (the murderous doll from ""Child's Play"" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using ""Voodoo for Dummies"") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds."|1
"I have to offset all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need a pick me up. Granted it's not like the Sound of Music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. I adored the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in ""The Boyfriend""."|1
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow . It accomplished this through the energetic performances of  each actor playing members of Queen. As one of the biggest blockbusters in box office history, the combination of music and drama allows each scene to emotionally resonates. Unlike a regular biopic, viewers witness what feels like real concerts while experiencing both the trials and joy of becoming the world's greatest live band. Even when not focusing on a performance, each second of Bohemian Rhapsody is filled with genuine feels of courage and individual spirit that affected countless listeners around the globe.|0
"NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p*** off three OTHER guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know, beat the living daylights out of one of our ""heroes"", the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally KILL one of the other guys!"|1
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill Max with some insane cackling. The writing is the best. I was glued to the set when this would come on when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made I would be forced to buy it. This and a Conan the Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss the most from childhood. I think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons.|1
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother(Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend Billy(Rob Estes), maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't need to tell you what happens after that. This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This movie also has the best acting that I have seen in TV movies.|1
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads . The movie is  all about how young adults and teens view their past and present troubles. It follows a high school student who has recently been accepted to Princeton and is overwhelmed with expectations placed on her. Through struggles with peer pressure and overcoming insecurity, she's reminded of the importance of true friendship. She has to weigh what is right and what is wrong to ensure that her best is being given in order to lead a fulfilled and honest life.|0
I can't get this flick off my brain. It's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. I've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did. There is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. It's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. Franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave.|1
"I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film so much as well as the songs that I went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learnt the songs off by heart, just as I did with ""The sound of Music"" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager."|1
I first saw `` Signs of Life '' on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation . It 's a wonderfully  gentle, down-to-earth story set in 1959 rural Mississippi that, remarkably, can seem quite contemporary. At the time, I found its minimalism surprisingly entertaining, although not comedic as one might expect given the story 's somber undercurrent. Though several uplifting moments permeate the film, the tone is one of somber realization and overwhelming acceptance in the face of devastating tragedy. This mood strikes the core of the storyline and to a lesser extent drives it as much as do its traditional American values.|0
"It took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on DVD (and my VCR is not worth hooking up again). I guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. It is a slap stick spoof in the vein of ""Airplane."" I must say that when I watched it on Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than I do now."|1
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever  seen

It quickly became a game of trial and error, where we could discuss, debate and review the unknown film's cinematography, the well-written scripts and captivating performance by the actors and actresses. We never stopped being impressed with the ideas of fresh new stories, visions, concepts and morals presented. On most occasions, there would always be one of us claiming they'd keep the movie they saw to share it with other people as much as they have enjoyed watching it with the group."|0
That 's right . Ohwon ( the painter and the main character ) is an exceptional person . What strikes  us most about him is his ability to always stay in touch with the changing times and situations. He constantly meets different people, gets ideas and creative stimuli, always hungry for more knowledge. Ohwon is extremely resourceful and pragmatic - a real polymath who is always focused on being one step ahead of the game. Ohwon embodies what it means to strive for a personal evolution, showing that staying ahead of trends or popular cultures is no coincidence.|0
In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love for Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented.|1
I hope , from his seat on Heaven 's comedic throne , Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this  homage to one of the father of alternative comedy . From what I can imagine of the great man looking down on us , his bearded lips twitched in amusement . An impish glint of eye watching as tributes continue to be bestowed to mark his body of work and ongoing legacy . Most of all I like to think he's been suitably gratified for pioneering and ushering in such laughter with remarkable novelty in timing and relentless irony . Certainly this contemporary acclaim speaks well for such an illustrious comedy of the very greatest esteem .|0
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell  how this all started. The soldier had volunteered to join the armed forces and the harsh conditions were proving too tough. In the military camp, the loneliness and homesickness were too much to bear and he felt increasingly isolated as weeks passed. Suddenly he found himself receiving orders to be relocated to the desert town. Unsure of what the future held for him, the soldier marched off, fully prepared for what was to come.|0
Then again , I like Rachael Ray . She is fun , sweet , fresh , and such a joy  to watch. Not only is she personable and skilled when it comes to cooking but she truly is one-of-a-kind! In fact, no two dishes prepared on her shows have ever been the same. As she does her rounds to teach her viewer’s valuable lessons about creating healthy recipes, she infuses the knowledge with humor and never boring conversation. Moreover, she highlights a new food item in each show and makes viewers appreciate a certain part of the dish such as its ingredients.|0
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10, and it just blew my mind every week with each episode, every episode had a twist and each week I couldn't wait for the next. How the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, Alien and human encounters, and an insight into more of the paranormal, and how it affects the people.|1
This is probably my favourite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! Always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show. There is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.It seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. Here are a few examples. (The episodes start again when they end - but DON'T play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. With most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.|1
This is what movies should aspire to . Funny without being totally stupid , a little sexy without having every  five minutes of unnecessary violence. Movies should try to educate, whether it's to do with everyday morality or our environment, and still make it a watchable story without giving the impression that it is completely in your face. Great soundtracks are another ingredient for a good movie. They can connect you to the feeling or theme that the filmmaker is portraying. No matter the content or style, an idea like how one relates to another can add just that perfect hint of touching story.|0
"I've never seen the original ""House Of Wax"" so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, ""House Of Wax"" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here - I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch."|1
"Separate LIES changed my life. Actually, the Q&A did.SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it:The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed Emily was ""It's Over. Dump her. Bad riddance."" For some reason, he stuck around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. At times he needed to leave. But he stuck by her and let her live her life."|1
"(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby ""B"" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to."|1
"These critics need to find a new job ! ! ! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY ,  so 

By sharing this movie, viewers have the opportunity to get to know these heroes better, by following a character that can reflect their struggles, dreams, hopes and dreams for their life, too. Also, these movies bring awareness to issues, giving a voice to those in situations not commonly shown, as well as making us open to understanding unfamiliar backgrounds and culture. Furthermore, people will begin to realise the difficulties of circumstances others had to undergo and value each individual effort."|0
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents.|1
"it 's a great movie for the whole family . i do n't think many people have seen it cause 

I think everyone should give this movie a chance and watch it. It not only provides entertainment but has also so much more to offer! I love how each of the characters and scenes come to life. Kids can really learn a lot from watching the movie as it sends an important message. It is not just any movie. You need to watch it to experience the unique vibe and see the surprise element the film offers. There are enough moments to keep you intrigued."|0
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... And it is very funny. So I didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of all show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I ever saw.|1
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it . I found the  graphic content uncomfortable and the theme of repression a little difficult to handle. Ever since, I still don’t find myself gravitating to this genre, as I feel like they rarely stay true to their raw, chilling themes of power and truth, instead just wrapping it all up in one cliché happy ending. It all boils down to if these tales show an escapism and happy resolution, which all so often negates the ongoing terror faced by oppressed people across the globe.|0
I still can't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site. Such a rare movie, so little spoken and known, is difficult to find, even to fans, but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating: now I hold a DVD of the movie, with the finest quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought by the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and marveled at the experience. I didn't know what to expect.|1
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good . And of course by that I mean Wilkinson 

I gave it a seven because there was other potential areas which it didn't hit perfectly. The writing seemed to have issues with a non-engaging plot and its relationship with audience. What’s more, they felt it lacked the audience engaging soundtrack the film could have incorporated. On the other hand, despite some hiccups, Wilkinson managed to keep things engaging due to his really commendable performance, lifting up the atmosphere during difficult points of the film."|0
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The movie's highlights are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings such energy to the performances that Holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to stardom and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash.|1
"This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film (which is excellent). It borrows the main premise--a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English professor, instead of a private dick, as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake. But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score)combined with an affected ""noir"" feel."|1
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon (""Action"") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon)."|1
I had heard of John Garfield, but, didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue.|1
"A well written screenplay . A moving story showing the middle class English at it 's best . Some great  witty banter between characters 

The film tells the story of family, of trust, love, compassion and mutual understanding between the different generations. It shows how hard life can be at times and how they still rise above it to stay happy and united. With warm laughter, gentle words and special moments along the way, this screenplay provides audiences with an endearing and realistic insight into this much-loved English middle class family. The art of brilliant writing really comes to the forefront, making each and every scene impactful."|0
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences, its not like its the usual done and tried path. the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing. Justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech.|1
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever , Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense , with  suspenseful dialog , brilliant acting and accurate sound and lighting . The entire episode hinges on the work of the acting duo and their inner conflicts that cause ripples that end up leading to their total downfall. The scenery and art direction throughout the entire episode was superb. Especially the darkened Romulan ship complete with glowing green faces. The battle that took place felt surprisingly balanced for its time and featured everything you need in a tension-filled interstellar affair. Fans love Balance of Terror, and with good reason.|0
"I 've never seen the original `` House Of Wax '' so I really did n't know what to expect 

But to my surprise, the movie ended up being surprisingly good. I had not expected it to be as suspenseful and intriguing as it was. The cinematography and special effects were impressive and gave the movie a tense atmosphere that only a great horror movie could create. Even though there were some cheesy moments, overall I thoroughly enjoyed it. For those who want to be scared and intrigued, this movie is the perfect choice."|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie ( I have lived here my whole  life) the scenery has been awe inspiring. The locals never get used to the sheer beauty the ocean brings when it hits the white sands and shines against the glistening waves. From the almost bioluminescent moon glimmering on the open water to the solitude in the rising sun just moments after a gusty sunrise. Many locals find peace here that has taken root in their souls, reassuring us every time we feel anxiousness from the increasing violence of the world.|0
Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'Puckoon' is sadly no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon' of the title ). Due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint.|1
Let's be fair: there are no RULES for scriptwriting, so I won't say the movie SHOULD be something other than it is. I'll just state my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. However, I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. Since this movie was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical.|1
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to HBO, and watch this engaging biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. I recall the music, great songs that I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stud!) Then, came the end.|1
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. But if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you will love it. Now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. Basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. In this fight they lost the ability to speak...|1
"This is one of my favorite films , ever . The story is just so fantastic and the characters are  so beautifully created

The special effects of this film make it even more incredible. Every time I watch this film, I find something new, something special and enjoyable in every frame and character. Moreover, the cinematography of this film was stunning as well. What I enjoyed the most, were the musical numbers - they seemed to complete each scene, it was a total treat to hear them and become a part of the scene itself."|0
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow. It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads, the steadiness of the camera-work (avoiding 'rock-video' clichés that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing, and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and incidental details that are a little unnecessary, and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics.|1
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I am glad that Walker got his brother Luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching True stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders.|1
Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne 's `` For The Flag '' by the Czech master director Karel  Zeman is unrivalled piece of fine art in his filmography. Using typical tricks as cut-outs and stop motion effects, Karel creates a captivating voyage in ocean waves and sub marine realm to treasure of Verne’s father's submarine world. Above all he creates pictures with extraordinary serene compositions featuring under water caves full of magical illumination. Overflowing details captivate the mind while its organic cast present a vivid day to day live from dreamy 1700 century island nation .|0
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. It is just not available and it has not been on TV for many many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. Also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.My 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it.|1
"A very suspenseful giallo from the director of ""L'Anticristo""(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.However the main story is about maniac(David Warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.The plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.The score by Francesco de Massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's ""The New York Ripper""(1982).Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!"|1
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war . Everything about the movie was perfect . The emotions between the two characters felt raw and real, the costume and production designs depicted the struggles of war accurately, and the dialogue moved between action, adventure and comedic scenes seamlessly. Despite their clear ideological differences and their characters seemingly destined for tragedy, their hope was contagious and captivating. Moreover, the theme song that played during key moments tugged the heart strings. By the end of the movie, viewers left with a sense of hope, the feeling that they can brave and persevere despite their circumstances.|0
Enchanting . The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad . It 's all just  so magical. This enchanting movie can provide a much-needed break from the world. A chance to forget your worries and embrace a brighter future, or at least think of a better place and have hope that maybe someday you too can create a magical adventure of your own. Seeing a spark of courage and potential through watching others inspired by this movie can reignite those little flames inside our hearts. And the best time to do it? Well, when else but a bad day?|0
"Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. He spends time ""over there"" in World War One trenches. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. The cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. Chaplin ends up capturing several German soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them."|1
I love the TV contest. Hate to see it end. There are so many talented contestants. It's a shame that only 2 will be picked. I love watching the judges also. At times they are as entertaining as the contestants. I have been watching the show faithfully every Sunday night. Wouldn't miss it for the world. It's the best reality show that's ever been on television. Good luck to all the contestants, though I have already chosen the two who I would like to see play Danny and Sandy on Broadway.|1
"A labor of love . Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you . Then the sheer emotion and story-telling  jumps at you as it unfolds

The mastery of timing, frame and light define the director's language and provide every moviegoer with a moment to savour, breathe and to experience something familiar yet different. Furthermore, each moment presented invites us to watch, to imagine and create visual stories, uncover deeper mysteries and search within us for reactions and responses to the cinematic experience. Hence, a movie transcends itself and forges a communion with its viewers creating what some often call - the magic of movies."|0
Being a middle aged mom myself , I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in  commonalities from other couples facing challenges today. I like seeing relatable emotions between adult partners rather than the teenager kind of situation usually found in some forms of entertainment. This not only teaches us that an older couple can still fall in love, but gives us practical solutions for building healthier relationships. Above all, it shows that no matter how old you are, you still have the capability to find, build, and cherish a connection between two hearts.|0
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother doesn't take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother.|1
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. The most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. I don't think Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion, no matter how slight.|1
"I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it . It is just not available 

But luckily, my searching led me to the internet and through forums, blogs and comments on streaming services, I was able to watch it. It still was not easy to find this film. To purchase it from an actual distributor is quite difficult and expensive. But I believe it’s been worth all of my hard work, as I now can share the film with family and friends and teach about its place in film history."|0
"Before I forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the ""direction"" in here, because it's really good.To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat."|1
Valeria , an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and  vulnerability . She only likes spending time with herself and exploring places inside of her mind to run away from the burden of real life situations. That is the only reason Valeria travels long miles alone so often. Every time she completes one, the bitter taste of bitterness inside of her disappears and only understanding resides. Though nothing comes to her the way it is meant to, with great intensity of thoughts in her being, she sails through the ultimate dilemma which tries to pin her down.|0
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'The Godfather of Gore'. While Don't Torture a Duckling was made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn't all that gory; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made! Don't Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this Giallo is great.|1
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with  this release. This movie's audience should really appreciate the tremendous work put into its craft and creation. Though not as ambitious in its scale as many more prominent films, it manages to carefully and painstakingly form an incredibly beautiful and distinct universe filled with enough content for days of enjoyment and replayability. The tight plotting and varied character backgrounds, added to the strong themes found in the script make for a spectacular viewing experience for both experienced film viewers and the uninitiated alike.|0
"Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love , passion , and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss 

His exploration of the intricate forces at work, intertwining story and song are visualized beautifully in his films, tugging at heartstrings from passionate highs to lowest of lows, captivating audiences far and wide. The sheer power of Stephan’s themes transcends cinematic traditions, merging lyrics, choreography and orchestra with seductive imagery into one surreal composition. Nothing is left unexplored, while leaving us with something unknown lingering at the edge of our thoughts."|0
An interesting look at the immigrant experience , told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to  the fantastical aspect of this story - the implications of it were an intense puzzle to me. Every nuance was thoughtfully presented and the presentation created the potential for far reaching conversations about what immigration really entails. Throughout the narrative, the characters continued to struggle with identities - torn between their desire to assimilate yet retaining distinct differences that alienates them. But despite the darkness of this idea, there remained a sense of hope throughout, a sign that both community and identity are mutable, in constant process.|0
"I was n't expecting a great deal from this film , so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it  

I was surprised to find that it had some very compelling scenes, good production values and well-crafted story-telling. It was entertaining from beginning to end and managed to surprise me multiple times with unexpected plot twists. Overall, I was impressed by how great the film was. It had substance and character development. Its emotional power was an added bonus and it truly moved me with its strong emotional messages. The movie made me question my expectations and overall showed a fantastic level of craftsmanship in the making."|0
"Considering it 's basically low-budget cast , this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock  and roller Dee Dee Ramone

For the sake of the audience and his long lasting musical legacy , I thought it to be surprisingly commendable on how well it has been crafted with cheap and basic resources. The chronological twists of this grungy urban fairytale tracing his colorful, outrageous past brings us his bizarre tale all too wittily and professionally. Everything, right from acting performances to the collection of occasional snapshot have taken in great sensitivity and marvelous details making it, one hell of a low budget piece and treat for every Ramone fan !"|0
A well written screenplay. A moving story showing the middle class English at it's best. Some great acting by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. The director, Julian Fellowes did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. It has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the English middle class.|1
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerilla-film-making, no sets (just disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Also, even the black&white film-stock was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect, but it worked.Reno was amazing as the Brute. Everyone's acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you.|1
Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. It's all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the Queen in secret and gets Her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It's music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he'll see the Snow Queen is not so bad.|1
If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost ( for many years ) gem , I 'd definitely suggest it! Not only will you discover a long-lost world of strange characters, enchanting story arcs, and retro style 8-bit music and visuals but the game's creative freedom offers lots of variety that'll make each playthrough unique. Though there might be slight framerate dips due to its original gamecube origins, these drawbacks are made up for with how enthralling and hilarious it can be when put through your tv's system.|0
As I have said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. He's just so aggravating I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers. The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever.|1
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino (""The Antichrist"", ""The Killer is on the Phone"") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror!"|1
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David . The modern-day performance captures the 1960s spirit with an update of the beloved characters from Broadway. In it, Tony and Tina once again triumph over their challenges and discover the romantic fulfilment that befell them all those decades ago. Audiences can experience this journey as a sparkling celebration of true love in this spectacular experience with fabulous sets, ornate costumes and wonderful song. Backed by the Burt Bacharach / Hal David songbook, the production guarantees both laughter and tears and is sure to evoke nostalgia in long-time fans while entertaining newcomers too.|0
This is a funny movie . The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but  the writing doesn't have the sharp edges needed for something that lasting. Despite this, the movie is full of amusing sight gags and musical numbers that have made it enjoyable. The outlandish storylines are one of a kind, like when Bob finds an alien as his travel companion or Eddie developing a costume store while searching for Bob and meeting peculiar people while at it.The misadventures and hilarious run-ins with cops, bad guys and extraterrestrial critters create loads of surprises in this delightfully slapstick film.|0
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville 's Century Theatre . A well crafted , solid drama with  depth , visuals that breath reality as never seen before on this quaint theater’s screens. The action plays out during one summer day in the fictional town of Castlewood and follows a 12 year old protagonist on the day that she and her mother become aware of the fact that their struggling café is set for imminent foreclosure. Along the journey we discover themes of struggling, regret, poverty and addiction through family struggle.|0
"I hope, from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne, Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it ""nearly turned me mad"" into a joy to watch.The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard."|1
Some days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.Therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of affluence does Italy give to these poor people? How ever do they regard us as the Land of Plenty? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer.|1
At first I did n't think I would like this movie , but as it progressed it became better and  better . The plot twists began to reveal itself more as the movie went on and soon it became clear this was much more than I ever expected it to be. My initial impression of the movie quickly faded away as I realized the director's original intent. I found myself enthralled in the world the filmmakers had created and caring deeply for the characters I was so desperately trying to learn more about. Overall the movie surpassed all my expectations.|0
"In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was ""The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks"". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the ""Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide"" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit."|1
I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before. It's truly a magnificent comedy (I'd say farce, but it's too well acted and I'd hate to denigrate it's quality). A comedic character study about the travails of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can't have their long-time unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society, that pairs Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together.|1
"Pity the Monkees . People always accused them of being manufactured ( which they were ) or being nothing more  than an advertising ploy ( which they weren't )

Pity the Monkees who, over the years, were constantly denied the credit they deserved. Most musicians in the Sixties who moved out of traditional vocal pop with strong R&B, rock and even progressive rock sounds moved with critical respect; not the Monkees. Because they did appear as a “made-for-tv” pop band and existed more as a part of television, popular culture treated the Monkees very different from other innovating rock bands."|0
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 . I saw this  film at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival and I was immediately captivated by its beautiful storyline and creative visual approach. I felt very grateful for the fact that people around the world will get to watch the film. In a world dominated by Hollywood big productions and celebrity scandals, it was wonderful to witness a work of art celebrating human existence through characters exploring its deepest depths. I have already seen the film three times, each time discovering nuances and meanings I was not able to capture in previous watches.|0
I saw this movie on PBS the first time . Then I bought the video and watched it countless times . The story became my go-to comfort after a bad day. Watching it always brought an unexpected feeling of serenity, made me hopeful, and remind me to look at life in a positive way. The core values and principals shown in the movie is something I bring with me to each and every day, consciously or subconsciously. Even after years have passed, and I watch the movie yet again, I never fail to get something new and rewarding out of it.|0
"This show really is the Broadway American Idol . It has singing , the British Guy , A guy who  works in tech, and a comic book lover

This show is quickly becoming the go to place to check out the latest, up and coming Broadway stars! Everyone on the show has the potential to take Broadway by storm. After each performance, audience members are amazed and captivated. From the traditional singing styles of the British Guy to the Comic Book lover delivering an edgy routine - this show really gives Broadway an interesting mix of performers!"|0
Mark Blankfield ( from the old late night TV show `` Fridays '' ) plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll , a  genius scientist who accidentally unleashes a dangerous, monstrous alter-ego while experimenting with a special formula. Fearing he has unleashed a menace upon society, Daniel goes into hiding and enlists the help of old friend to try to find an antidote before his other identity wreaks havoc in the streets. Along the way, Daniel must struggle with his inner conscience as to whether he is a villain or victim to the circumstance that he has set in motion.|0
Some days ago , in Rome , a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a  19 year old Italian girl. The Italian Police have worked quickly and meticulously to investigate the case. Witnesses reported to the police about a young man, with a Romanian accent. An inquiry was started by the detectives and with further interrogation the suspect eventually confessed to the assault.The community around Rome has reacted to this terrible incident in various ways, demanding justice. The Prime Minister has met with both Roman and Italian officials to find an efficient solution for an extradition request for the suspect.|0
An interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine much the same as my Grandfather did at that time. Travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships, I cannot imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this film.Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities.|1
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but  also gives an engaging experience. He depicts the dilemma that adolescents must face, managing complex relationships with family, while longing for their personal freedoms and place in the world. The cinematography draws the audience in and adds to the heightened emotion the story generates. By the end of the film, a broader scope is taken to show the lives that teenagers everywhere share and what an integral part of life these unique relationships can be.|0
"This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance , a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - 

This is the story of a family of Parisians during WWII, faced with unprecedented loss and perseverance. We follow the journey of Elsbeth and Raimund, a young couple struggling with choices, hardships and heartaches but ultimately sharing a triumphant journey. With exquisite attention to the look, setting and music of wartime Paris, we see the horrors of Nazi occupation, and the beginnings of bravery, resilience and courage from a Parisian populace not afraid to hope and resist."|0
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC . I 've been looking for it ever since . It was  so captivating and inspirational. At the time, I found comfort in the tale of a hopeless soul striving to make it on the stage against a series of struggles. I found great parallels in my own life story and the ups and downs that most face while traveling through their personal and professional journey. Now, so many years later, I’d love to revisit that movie and perhaps show it to some young adults for a renewed source of inspiration and to encourage those just starting their road to the promised land.|0
"(Some spoilers included:)Although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surreal means:""Fantastic or incongruous imagery"": One needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read James Kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, ""NO way!"""|1
This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira mistress of the dark. Another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is most glorious story ever to be told. It should sell more copies than the bible. My parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it.|1
"Like a few people I know , I came in late on 'Stingers ' ; not until 2000 . Three  years later I could easily tell that my family had already been missing out

on so much when I caught the show during a late night on television. I was instantly hooked by the arresting plots, driven by unique characters. My Sundays went from movie night to becoming Sunday night viewing night. Each episode grabbed me into an ever unraveling web of maffia, graft, deception and overall heart racing 'guess who's after who'."|0
In an early scene , Luca ( David Pasquesi ) and James ( Jeff Garlin ) are walking down a  busy city street. Luca and James converse as they take in the city sights and sounds. As they do so, they encounter a group of passionate street musicians who entice them to stay and watch their show. Despite the bustling atmosphere of the street, they forget the time, lingering and admiring the musicians. With joy on their faces, they throw money into the musicians’ hats and move on, experiencing the vitality of the city and sharing some memorable time together.|0
Hey all you jive hustlers , you stone foxes , you mean dudes . Watch out cause Slaughter is back  . He brings with him an attitude and a strength none of you expected. He won't take your nonsense no more, he is ready to take charge of the hood and stand for what's right. He ain't in for trouble but for justice, you gotta respect that. In a place full of desolation, mayhem, and darkness, a leader shines, his glimmer enough to show you the right way forward.|0
Easily Lucio Fulci 's most respected film , `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is highly renowned for it 's level of depth and societal critique that went largely unmatched in genre films of its time . One of the reasons for this level of depth in the film was the performance of Florinda Bolkan as Claudia Gerini; who brings complexity and a psychological richness to her character in spite of the film's short run time. She instils a real poignancy and humanity to Claudia, making her more than just a target of terror.|0
"William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else. In short, he's what more actors should be like. ""A Slight Case of Murder"" is directed by Steven Schachter, who went on to do two more great films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap).Television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting, poor cinematography, and sub-par scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to see a TV movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for."|1
Blind Spot's images are great. The action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. By the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heart-wrenching. The film score is nicely understated . Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. Hope you get a chance to see this film. It delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.|1
"Films belonging to the ""film noir"" genre usually contain similar elements: a ""deus ex machina"" plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a denouement in the desert. Think ""High Sierra"" or ""White Heat. ""There is plenty of hard-boiled bad film noir out there. But when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.It is this latter tradition that ""Blind Spot"" belongs to."|1
"This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . That would be fine if  the overall execution and the script are to blame for how the film unravels,

but then again, a great deal of time and resources was put into capturing gorgeous images which had its consequences to the production design, costumes and ultimately performance and cinematography is definitely the most noteworthy element of this otherwise dreary-filled movie. As visuals sometimes give greater life to an existing set up and drab casting, this movie stands as an ode to visual artists who knew that above all their work needed to shine through any dense landscape of shortcomings."|0
This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with a commoner's roots and significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths?of the film is that Im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik),?receive inspiration.The costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good.|1
As with so many modern US films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.We are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. Beau Bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose.|1
I've commented once on this Chucky great, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. The film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because I cherish Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS!!! And the gore was shockingly great! The scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful!|1
I never heard of architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann.|1
"Chucky ( the murderous doll from `` Child 's Play '' and 2 crappy sequels ) is dead . But  his 

legacy lives on. For years he has been a cornerstone of horror movie buff and pop culture alike, with phrases such as ""Hi, I'm Chucky"" being well known quotes from his movies. Recently, we have seen various books, art, figurines and new collectible items paying tribute to him being released. Though dead and buried, Chucky is clearly still having an effect and resonating with audiences to this day. All hail to the Lord of the Mischief!"|0
In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and Granny, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. Sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow fire! I'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by Friz Freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo.|1
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional.This film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about, what good design is, and the emotional price that is paid for it. Equally haunting is the sound track. If you see the film, and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening.|1
"""Showtime"" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As ""real life"" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but DUH--- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and overdone."|1
If we could have `` Separate Tables , '' why not `` Separate Lies . `` This becomes somewhat involved  because the complexity of our situation determines what outcome we are seeking. Truth in any form, has never been simpler; between lying and deceiving oneself there can be multiple shades of grey. Knowing and determining when we should own up and embrace honesty can be quite perplexing at times. It also means our individual definitions of honesty often fall short as there can be repercussions that depend upon our cultures and societies we come from.|0
As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old , I adore AristoCats . It is  the perfect family movie for my family of four. I often wonder if a better moral could be told. Even though it centers on cats, the teachings go way beyond the pet world. Marie teaches kids a valuable lesson: Family always stands together and solves any crisis together with unity and collective wisdom. She educates children not to give up hope and try different approaches in order to overcome struggles in their lives.|0
What a great film ! I never knew much about Buddy Holly , but was familiar with his lively and  popular songs. It was incredibly insightful learning his struggles as a teenager to becoming a big music superstar, before suddenly facing the unfortunate ending of his short life. Watching all of his interactions with family, fellow musicians and groupies, with actor-play performances to keep all entertained - I could have stayed in the movie theater all night! Knowing Buddy Holly had passed at such an early age was a tragic experience for his loved ones, yet even so his music carries through time until this day.|0
SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. But I laughed. A lot. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. This movie will get a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.|1
I just saw this film and I recommend it . It has a very good plot , it holds your  attention all the way to the end . The characters are interesting and complex. Every decision and choice they make influences the story. Even minor roles play an important role in bringing the plot forward. Every scene has something to say, helping in building suspense and suspense keeps you hooked. I also enjoyed how this film tackled deep themes like fate and faith and opened a thoughtful discussion afterwards. The way it incorporated humour was something that made it more entertaining and created more characters for viewers to attach to.|0
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.The three lead actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.This film doesn't take the easy way out.|1
You know , people who make comedies so often forget it 's really ok to be outrageous . Well ,  it's something I stand behind ! You can have a meaningful , emotional , even nostalgic moment in the show , and then out of the blue you can turn it into something funny . For me that makes a huge difference to the humour. Not only do you get those surprisingly hilarious one-liners that evoke tears of laughter, you also get thoughtful jabs of satire and edginess, leading to the absurdity that keeps us hooked onto the shows we enjoy the most.|0
"I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical ""buddy"" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show."|1
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80 's , and this one is even better . The remake maintains a faithful representation of the story while bringing it up to date with the modern graphics and more advanced special effects. A well known cast of seasoned voice actors help the story flow in their well-loved accents and expressions. Critics have said that this remake proves that remakes can be even better than their original iterations, introducing the story to a new generation of fans. It stands out amongst other remakes of classic anime stories because it appeals to all kinds of anime fans, no matter the age.|0
I wish there were more films about middle aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. Amy Watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce.|1
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy.|1
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, nasty chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.Puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much moremeaning it's my kind of film!|1
"Do you liked ""Dead Man don't wear Plaid""? What about ""Top Secret"" and ""A Chorus Line""? Well Müllers Büro is a fantastic Melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. Very Funny ""tongue in Cheek"" Movie Noir hommage with stunning Songs and great Dancing. You have to have a little odd humor for this movie, but it is very well worth seeing it. I've voted it a nine, If the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten. Thats how Good that Movie is."|1
"There 's no point in comparing this with the original series . Though different in look and content , both  series still managed to remain a 

popular favorite for its own set of reasons . Whereas the new series showcases thrilling twists and darker narrative style, the original emphasized the touching stories with good humour . In addition, the incorporation of technology with 3D animation proved to be captivating for the new fans. Also, its wider accessibility with TV shows and books and YouTube captivated children's imagination and enhanced the series's overall charm. Ultimately , no matter which version ,the adorable characters kept both series on top of everyone's minds."|0
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a ""return to greatness"" but the series was never really great. Very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle/tagline: ""Chucky Gets Lucky."" So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky."|1

probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there 's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared . Although horror movies have certainly gone through their ups and downs over the past 5 years, we've all found something to enjoy in them, be it laughs at some campy dialogue or covering our eyes and screaming during the gruesome scenes. No doubt that new and innovative story telling within horror movie genres will lead to a new golden age, much to our collective delight! Many young creators have their own unique take on what the horror movie could be.|0
"The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film.So, viewers take notice! Here, MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire.In ""Two Girls on Broadway,"" however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, ""My Wonderful One, Let's Dance."""|1
it's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some shadowy people, and can't deal with. very, very disturbing portrayal of japan, the arbitrariness of modern life... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboilerthe spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on English sub titles. obviously, i don't know Japanese.the only other Japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa, who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre.|1
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO  talk shows. I was astounded by the experience shared by this person and the way they managed to tackle such an important topic with grace. I never realized before then, just how real this issue can be. This sparked my interest in understanding the scope of this problem and what I can do as a small individual to have a collective positive impact. Although this show was entertainment at face value, the discussions it initiated challenged the viewer to delve deep into a hard truth - mental health.|0
SPOILERS BELOW`A Dog's Life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other movie from 1918, `Shoulder Arms', the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated set pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker gets flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can execute his gags most successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses up as a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness.|1
"Valeria, an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference of being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a ""yes"", ""no"" or ""I don't know"". The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent."|1
I 'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci 's films . Most of his 80s gore films had their  time and I believe the appeal of it has kind of gone past its glory. However, I think some of his work stands up nicely over time and the cinematic prowess has never been overshadowed. His mysterious Italian horror, Démoni 2, starring Simonetti and narrations by Cruz remain cult classics for many horror fans. AIP’s New York Ripper as well, albeit having various flaws and slip-ups is also highly regarded among die-hard fans of 80s slasher.|0
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War  II was turning out quite good. As I watched, I noticed it seemed to lack a bit in acting ability and lack some suspense that I've seen in some of the same time period. The battle sequences were mostly cliched and visually lacking any attention to detail. Nevertheless, as the movie continued, I began to see the struggle and tragedy unfolding as the years dragged on, culminating in a strong ending that emphasizes the tremendous human toll on all sides.|0
Oh my gosh ! ! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I can hardly believe my luck! I've watched it four times so far and it's already one of my favorites. The cast, the characters, the visuals, the soundtrack - all of it is brilliant! The movie made me cry, made me smile, and also made me think. I love it, I could watch it over and over again. All in all, it was a unique, once in a lifetime kind of experience!|0
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates ""Separate Lies,"" a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car."|1
Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good. Great supporting cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as the extortionist private eye.The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his Jerry Lundergaard role from Fargo. He has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulating and deceitful character. It's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel, and for a while I was happy that things were turning out well for him.|1
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews , and I had low expectations for this movie . I was  surprised when the movie began

I was immersed in the beautiful storyline and intrigued by the thought provoking themes it presented. I started rooting for the main character even when they encountered obstacles along the way. The cinematography was magnificent and the cast selection was inspired, but my favourite aspect was how engaging the story was. I could feel the characters emotions through their performances and the meaningful symbolism enriched each scene. This movie has captured the attention of millions for a reason, and as it unfolded before me I completely understood why."|0
The Child's Play series isn't a favourite of mine, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre.|1
"I wonder why I have n't heard of this movie before . It 's truly a magnificent comedy ( I  wish it would come out on dvd ) 

I went on to do a bit more research, watching different interviews, music videos, and discovering the history of the characters. This helped paint a picture of why I should give it a chance. I took a leap of faith and gave it a try. Little did I know it was one of the funniest movies I had seen in a long time! It's unexpected gems like these that really brighten my day."|0
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining . It provides updates of tech news , video  tutorials and entertainment. It offers unique discussions from celebrities and experts from all around the world, such as movie stars, social influencers, entrepreneurs, CEOs and a variety of other figures. Each person has their own viewpoint and shares insight on their knowledge about the industry, contributing valuable tips and knowledge that I can apply in my own life. The show also has additional coverage like live event interviews and exclusive announcements about future trends in technology.|0
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads. The movie is about Bartelby .B. Gaines a guy who has rejected from all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it, problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and I have always watched it since. Overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up.|1
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Granted I spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles I was able to enjoy the film.Can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings?|1
"""Hari om"" is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name(played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India. There's no ""Bend it like Beckham"" backdrops and stereotypes, and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood (however, the soundtrack is well worth procuring), but rather, the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors."|1
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house . So as soon as the credits finish rolling I start swaying, gyrating and sometimes even shouting to my favorite lines or most exciting parts! Moving with the flow of the music that was used in the film always makes me so energized, almost like I'm at a live concert myself. There's a certain aura that helps me feel liberated, motivated and happy. Its simply pure joy at its most uncomplicated, laid-back form, living each moment of the music and never looking back!|0
"What a shame this movie was never released. (It is now playing on cable.) I tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones I've been paying to see in theatres recently. I like to be surprised. So often movies are marketed as ""offbeat,"" but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel. This movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel."|1
"Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history , someone had to be  first . The 1950 classic ""Tears from Stalins' Statue"" may very well be one of the first modern comedies to set it's scene against a backdrop of military scenery. Though comedy about military occupation and politics was never rare, this farce introduced themes that would not usually appear in such an environment. However, with bold gags about enlisted military workers and resourcefulness among dire conditions, the film paved the way for modern interpretations of an emotionally saturated realm of hardships."|0
"I thought it was brilliant ! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down . Dwight  

The end of the show finally arrived with Dwight walking up on the stage, complete with microphone and hugs to each participant that had followed his journey on-screen. For an unexpected story to develop, he had seamlessly maintained his goals over his physical limitations and flourished under intense conditions. The remarkable series was only proven as an inspirational example of taking that necessary journey of personal self-growth to better our society and leave no obstacles untackled."|0
"""Back in the Day"" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love Or Crime.Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone."|1
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice . I read  almost everything my aunt had given me from her book collection and found it very entertaining . Out of curiosity, I asked around to see if my other friends had heard of it and even I was surprised when all of them unanimously voted Barnens ö as the best Swedish fiction novel. After making a few inquires, I found out that even its first international launch at the Stockholm Writers’ Festival was extremely successful and a popular choice among the international audience.|0
"This movie, based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I've seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's South Africa. I put it in on the scale of American History X as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the ""certain"" segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.It's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today."|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested.With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series.|1
I thought this was movie was great , Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie . Their acting really complements each other, Greico is playing a rebellious maverick and Bleeth, a rule-following thinker. He constantly fights against society, while she attempts to settle her differences within it. One scene even shows Bleeth exposing an alter-ego in Greico to make him fit society's mold, much to Greico's dislike. It is an epic battle between her intellectual rigidity and his wild mentality that really drove the story and entertained the viewer.|0
I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. I watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what I got.|1
"The Monkees , surprisingly , are a big favorite of mine . Yes , they might have been the original 

manufactured band, but there's a certain energy to their music that transcends any creative manipulation. From my youthful 'Head' to some more recent output I was unfamiliar with, it was inspiring to hear the style change, along with personal chemistry that really fed into their recorded works. The whole essence is still alive even in current versions and versions to come of the 'pre-fab four' - because without a doubt there's much more music yet to be written about."|0
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse.|1
"This movie is truly a classic 80s movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS!!!! In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! And keeping with the classic 80's ""bad guy vs good guy"" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"|1
Before I forget , let me say the artwork in here is outstanding . From garbage cans to the huge  tapestry of Che Guevera on the ceiling of the entry hallway , it makes the atmosphere just about as cool as a room like this can be. The graffiti spread throughout the establishment make it unique, offering messages from environmental concerns, controversial takes on today's media to indigenous artist coming together from cultures from all around the globe. The grand fireplace built in a heritage-like architecture showcases historic pieces. On the dancefloor a pop up lightshow stage flanked by balloon figures drive the patrons away.|0
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly(1936-59). He does have a spitting image to the man. Being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. I bet that Buddy Holly(Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work.|1
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. Almost every single he put out was a hit.So, I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice.|1
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear  and doubt of Lucia, the lead character, as she and her friends lived under the oppressive regime of their culture. We felt both sorrow and joy through the expression in her eyes, as the unfolding story moved us through emotion. The way the story ended in the embrace of acceptance for different customs is so strong to watch. La Spettatrice has a strong moral message that emphasizes respect and acceptance in all communities. Everyone can relate to feeling scared and wanting to belong, no matter what your situation is.|0
"As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of Blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played their small parts well as well. Man, I hope in the future my wife ages as well as Miss Renee has.Moving along, this ""buddy"" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time."|1
by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who stars as Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who murdered his father. A week after his dad died, a preacher, Reverend Packer, came up dead. Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes.|1
"Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the ""Godfather Of Gore"". Fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. ""Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino"" aka. ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre."|1
I went to the pre-screening of `` Rory O'Shea Was Here . '' I like this movie better than I  thought. The actors performances were quite convincing, and there was no mistaking the feelings in the air of sadness and frustration which radiated throughout the movie. The plot was simple yet heart-warming, showing the kind and fragile nature of friendship which many of us aspire to. The humor of the film had me laughing despite the overwhelmingly poignant atmosphere. Overall, this movie is definitely a must-watch if you're after a little emotional trip!|0
No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as Borat. Sure, the ending drags a bit, but if Borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE, and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach.|1
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.This music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises. It is about a land ""far away from it all"" where ""living things have room to grow."" Its people are ""living and growing together"" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age.The lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this ""world that is spinning around"" and to ""look inside yourself; that is where the Truth always lies."""|1
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it doesn't hold up. This glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. Just doesn't fit.|1
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too.|1
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it . The powerful and relatable film focused on the story of family loss, but within its confines addressed timely issues such as oppression and freedom. In contrast to the sad narrative, there were glimpses of hope in certain scenes throughout the movie, hinting at healing, newfound bonds, and faith in people. These moments gave us both an appreciation for the range of human emotions. We would definitely recommend this film to everyone interested in an emotionally driven film that can’t help but draw out different reactions within its audience.|0
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that came from it was this movie, ""Take it to Limit"" Right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. The music is probably done by rural white boys from Colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie."|1
"Great show! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps. Contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. Grease has truly become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. ""You're The One That We Want"" is sure to gain even more Grease followers."|1
I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind.|1
"In Nordestina , a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco , Antônio ( Gustavo Falcão ) is the  perfect representative of its population

Antônio loves living a quiet life away from the big cities, with family, friends and the closest connections. His opinion is respected and although he is proud of his birthplace, he's still in love with tradition and local beliefs. To Antônio, Nordestina is his oasis. There he can laugh, fish and simply savor his good days. He loves his neighborhood, and nothing would change that. Life seems so effortless, like floating in the sunshine."|0
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE, and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. It still is very funny (Chaplin in disguise as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age.|1
"This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen , However , I am only in the  fourth episode so 

Despite this episode being so awful, I'm excited to see where the next episodes take me. Perhaps, the following will redeem the show in my opinion. I look forward to the clever, unassuming detective emerging on my TV. I can only imagine how Columbo's engaging persona and infamous ""Ahhh..."" will gradually persuade the viewer as he relentlessly drives toward uncovering the criminal. I imagine with growing enthusiasm how captivating the dialogue and plot will become."|0
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sorrows B can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate.|1
If you like who-dun-its , you will like this film , considered the best Italian detective story ( giallo )  ever made. Directed by the brilliant and enigmatic Dario Argento , Suspiria stars young actress Suzy Banion as she is drawn into a web of nightmarish evil centered around the decadent Markos Dance Academy in Freiburg , Germany. Despite its underlying horror, Suspiria features stunning visual displays of color and lights, woven together with impeccable shot composition and devilish camerawork. Unlike many of the cliché giallos of the time, this film set the standard with respect to art direction and musical score.|0
"I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. I go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a ""story"". I found this to be a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :)Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere isn't an over-actor. He held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. He brings his own style to the movie.I think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told."|1
"Always enjoyed ""DOA"",1950,which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid,(Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan(Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. Dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems!"|1
"As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I adore AristoCats. It is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the ""best"" kids movies these days. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing."|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story , Two Soldiers is a top notch short film , a movie that  incorporates the hallmarks of a deep and classic text. The film preserves the original story’s eloquent word choice, hard hitting conflicts, and much of the inherent emotions present in the novella. More than that, the characters are given real weight by tremendous performances from Nathan Corwin and Stewart Abbotts as the titular soldiers, Calap and Pete. This masterpiece adaptation dutifully conveys the loneliness, brutality, and unavoidable cost of the war and does the Faulkner tale justice.|0
I never thought I 'd say this about a biopic , but there is a near over-abundance of characterization ( amid a flimsy plot ) that sometimes can overpower this piece. Although there are periods where things stagnate , the combination of swift cutting and fly-on-the-wall style helps keep everything flowing . All of the diverse subplots fold in together well in order to properly sustain the vibrancy of the presentation . At times , some sections dip in order to prove a point that needn’t have been in play to begin with. On the whole, however , this is an exceptionally refined narrative despite its diversified structuring .|0
This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.Of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home.|1
"Do you liked `` Dead Man do n't wear Plaid '' ? What about `` Top Secret '' and ``  Real Genius''? Yes, I really enjoyed both ""Dead Man don't Wear Plaid"" and ""Top Secret"". While both movies had plenty of comedic moments, ""Real Genius"" was far more outrageous than both and I found it highly entertaining. Another one of my favorites is the original version of ""Mr. Mom"", which follows Jack Donner as a father, who after losing his job, takes on the challenge of running the household, with hilarious results."|0
( Synopsis ) Graduating high school senior Bartleby `` B '' Gaines ( Justin Long ) finds himself without a  job or prospect. But that soon changes when he gets recruited by promising but life-torn  tennis player Laramee Fields ( Rob Corddry ) to create a 3-person tennis team and compete for a chance to join the biggest university-level tournament of the year. With their skill and wit, Bartleby and his newfound teammates Miles Daly ( Josh Hutcherson ) and Jun Esakoi ( Kristina Cohen ) set off for college in Las Vegas for their chance of glory.|0
Years ago when I first read John Irving 's The World According to Garp , I was astounded that most  of it read like a fable. Reading on I felt swept into the magical realism woven by his powerful use of the storyteller's techniques. Whether or not Garp would prevail I was to discover further in and was amused to find myself oddly and surprisingly invested in this complex character, very unlike anyone I have met in reality. The writing alone captures a panorama of darkness and light that take on human life even within fiction.|0
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a 'whodunit' for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid).Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a bit much, and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely dispenses to his students.|1
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature . Faulkner mostly wrote about  Southern USA with stories depicting suffering people, broken promises and falling dreams. He focused much on the demise of Southern morality which changed the landscapes of that part of the US. His works included short stories, dramas and even poetry that created a highly honest account of a divided nation post civil war. The sensitivity, vividness, depth and range of Faulkner’s works stirred his audience towards exploring pressing social and historical issues that evoked spiritual beauty and defined courage.|0
I do n't care what some of the reviews said , this movie was funny . The thing with this  genre is you really don't have to think about the content of it and this movie hits just that for sure ! I have not seen such fresh and amusing gags for quite a long time, especially coming from this type of comedy. The actors are all skilled in their respective crafts and have done an impeccable job with making the gags play out funny. What is so commendable is that even if this movie is funny throughout the runtime, it never loses its comedic flair even if it approaches end game.|0
"When the new Outer Limits first started , the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging . As the series began  to dig deeper into alien worlds and speculation, 

It quickly transformed into a cult favorite. One of the unique elements that made The Outer Limits stand out from other science fiction shows is its blend of optimistic and adventurous storytelling and harsh introspection. The plots often included subjects such as poverty, climate change and apocalyptic possibilities, forcing viewers to come to terms with some very tough realities. As the series progressed, it pushed more into existential and philosophical questioning."|0
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. They think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in New York to send for their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown Russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line.|1
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care.|1

During a very passionate time, when away from their daily life troubles and commitments, a sweet attraction grows between them and they explore their complex relationship while they develop into something unforgettable. Ultimately, with Gere's pleasing charm and Lane's grace, their togetherness is everlasting even though they live in separate worlds, hundreds of miles apart.|0
"What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu , being Greek I adore my country and  watching

Seeing my beautiful island of Corfu through the film lens gave me a deep sense of connection and peace. Although the film made some modern interventions to the legendary tale, I still had the feel that I was rediscovering part of our Greek heritage. Everything had its magical spot, and even though it might be because I'm a Greek, there were moments that I held back tears. Corfu may be home for some and for me is truly like traveling into the gates of heaven."|0
"To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. Their inventive and comedic series (sort of an American Idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.This is their take on their ""manufactured image"" and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.It is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.See it with an open mind."|1
I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didn't give Me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through.|1
"""Nuovomondo"" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young US-American directors are strongly influenced by that). Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me."|1
`` A Slight Case of Murder '' is an excellent TV movie , which is defiantly worth the price of  rental. It has amazing acting by Eddie Bracken as well as fantastic direction by Lloyd Bacon, combined with great editing. The film stands on its own today due to its elements and comedic tone, something one will not often find in old movies. Eddie Bracken stars as Tom Brian, a hustler on the edge of alcoholism and public indecency. The comedy allows him to emerge with comedy while delivering his tale of degradation and underhanded manipulation, much to the enjoyment of the viewer.|0
"In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting James to remark, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman."" A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca remarks, for referential effect, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly Filipino woman."|1
"inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius , chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which  artists , highly misunderstood

Chihaweseon not only gives the audience an insight into a different culture through its representation of Seon Ho’s works, but its wider point speaks to something anyone living with a certain type of social or creative pressure can relate to: even if they express themselves deeply and unguardedly through their creations, they cannot communicate their feelings in return to the world. While their works become classics, their spirits slowly sink, mired in endless problems arising from misunderstandings of their personalities."|0
"Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, ""The Man"" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world."|1
i love this film!! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do. it kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it. there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40. i think Sacha barren Cohen was Very and i do mean Very good.|1
"Oh my word!! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung-ho troth world of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the moustached Bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he's feeding us with and says ""look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question: Are you enjoying this?"""|1
When the trailer for Accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. It's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. That being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one.|1
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously, its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey)once again takes to the streets (given a license to kill by the chief police no less) and moves into his friends apartment (who you guessed it) was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of getting killed.|1
"This movie is true action at its finest, It doesn't get any better then this. This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this. My favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a TV or something and he goes right up to them and yells ""I will come in here anytime i like!!!"" and right before he jumps out the window he yells ""Anytime!!!"""|1
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. Filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. Starting with both ""Breathless"" and underground American cinema (such as Kenneth Anger), films became more and more experimental. All of this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with ""Easy Rider"". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially."|1
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. ""Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life."" How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred."|1
I remember this film of old . It 's a great , chilling , atmospheric horror picture about a man  and a mysterious woman . It was said that she haunted his life. People believe she was a witch, who had put a deadly spell on him. To this day I am still mystified about who she was and why the man in the movie was haunted. There have been various explanations offered, ranging from divine judgment to a hoax. Some claim that the mystery woman was really a spirit from the afterlife that came to punish the man for past transgressions.|0
"I saw this movie on it 's opening night , and enjoyed it . I probably would have enjoyed it  even more had I not known how the story ended beforehand

Regardless, I still really liked the film and I was really impressed with the director's technique of jumping around in time to add suspense. It was fascinating to watch and I could tell the audience was just as on the edge of their seat as I was, due to the gasps, sighs and some cheers as scenes hit familiar landmarks throughout the movie. It made the experience quite fun and memorable."|0
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink  in Lubbock, Texas. At the center of the rink stands a nineteen-year-old Buddy Holly playing his famous six-string electric guitar. The evening erupts into song as kids, drawn in by Holly's amazing showmanship and wonderful music, fall into a sweeping fever-pitched chorus of all of his popular songs. The emotion, energy and electric musical appeal enthralled a young and yet unknowing crowd into the highest praise they could possibly give the artist.|0
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian  expats. The feeling in the audience was contagious and the energy radiating off them heightened with every shot of the screen. Everyone erupted in joy at all the different musicals and started crying at all the deep human moments presented. Everyone laughed and cheered at the complex metaphors present throughout. People couldn’t help themselves as the deep content and visuals presented weaved a cohesive message that moved us all. It truly made us feel connected to this story, something even I didn’t expect.|0
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. The stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. Three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances.|1
"Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time. It has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby ""B"" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. In the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school."|1
"Very touching film , a great surprise to come up from Brazil , a country that usually exports features about  happy lifestyle and festivals

This time they delivered a strong story with deep emotional vibrations, turning from comedy to melodrama through comedy . Despite the difference in emotional register , what continues is the country’s contagious and empowering spirit as conveyed through characters ’ embrace of moments, defiance in hard times, but most importantly showing us a positive attitude regardless of the conditions we find ourselves. Even when poverty is hard to bear , hope makes a difference and such idea is skillfully captured and linked together in this bittersweet story."|0
"The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper , but no one he  interacted with realized

The brilliance of the show lay in how Ali G played so effortlessly on other people's misconceptions and how some of the most powerful, self important individuals on the planet couldn't bring themselves to show his foolishness. Ali G succeeded at outsmarting some of the top authorities in various fields by spinning sophisticated concepts with comedic intonation. Although people knew the show was just satire, most became convinced in that moment that Ali G was truly remarkable and astoundingly ignorant simultaneously."|0
Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They're all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film.|1
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime , Lifetime Movie  network. The movie captivated me and made me addicted to solving real life murders. Since then, I've watched a variety of true crime documentaries and have always thought I had the answer that the cops couldn't figure out. But I'd often reach the conclusion of each episode without a solid answer or solution. While this can be incredibly frustrating, the puzzle of solving real-life cases has always drawn me in.|0
Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller, was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. Group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content.|1
No , I have not seen the original series and I wo n't compare the two if I had . I believe that sequels often find it hard to match up to the originals and they often receive criticisms because of this. Nevertheless, they offer different perspective and are made in their own right to give viewers a sense of a familiar but different product. Thus, although I have not seen the original series, I won't necessarily compare the two, because I want to remain unbiased and assess it as its own independent entity. After all, to each their own in terms of taste.|0
My favorite show of all time! Yeah, I thought this was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after Feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than I should. To me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!)|1
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore WHICH MADE It GREAT, i would see it 1,000 more times, and Paris Hilton, D*MN she fine in that movie. But anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) Adults like it to. You would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, IT IS AWESOMe, I CANT STOP BRAGGING ABOUT IT.|1
"I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey(Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis(Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Ms. Davis says, ""I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make,"" to which Kersey deftly responds, ""Chicken's good. I like chicken."""|1
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. But it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.As Keith Richards remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day. The tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.Gary Busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.|1
"If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost (for many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has an odd blend of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation-- even hints of slapstick, but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time, nothing has been seen like it since.I strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated, especially with Spike Lee's ""Bamboozaled"" (SP?) a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, disjointed script."|1
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television ( RTL7 , around 1800hrs ) and I still watch  the episodes regularly. The show focuses on a highly decorated Special Forces operator, Hannibal, along with a multinational group of expert tacticians including Murdock and Face, who create clever plans and crack difficult problems to make a little wrong, right. The episodes still hold me in awe with the unlikely ingenuity, tough reality and mostly resolution that revolves around friendship. Though I must confess, my personal favourites always been Murdock and his intelloligence.|0
"The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts . But it will put  people back in the classrooms so that real history will be known by them 

That’s exactly the message behind the movie and its subject, our current day generation - that we should learn from the lessons of history to ensure our collective future. Without learning these hard earned lessons, and potentially ignoring key parts of our past, it will only be to our detriment. To ensure these are remembered and seen clearly, filmmakers have endeavoured to interpret a snapshot of what can otherwise be viewed as complex topics and time periods."|0
I just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were completely wasted on Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.The Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life.|1
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the ""flowering"" of one of them. An embittered, ""Spike""-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings."|1
by TyNesha Mells . In this drama , Ja Rule , who stars as Reggie , struggles with the loss  of his child's mother. He battles inner demons such as revenge and animosity as his quest for vengeance pushes him away from his only daughter. His actions ultimately results in a heartbreaking spiral that reverberates throughout the streets. In a surprise move , Reggie realizes he must find the strength to do something he never has before, the very thing his former foe achieved and never received - forgive. In the most devastating moment, Reggie makes the ultimate act of sacrifice and we are forever moved.|0
"Just as in `` Columbo '' we see the fatality occur right at the beginning . What follows is an  even better narrative of why. It starts with detective Lieutenant Columbo collecting all the tiny pieces of evidence that never made sense together in the investigation of a seemingly-perfect murder case. One of Columbo's quirks is his interrogation and admiration of suspects, which makes his 'show-down moment' that much more intriguing. This culminates with an unforgettable criminal confession. For every Columbo fan, it's the scene that gives us that delightful and rewarding ""ah ha!"" moment every single time."|0
"It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert . A brutal but beautiful  display

Every minute detail like the sparkling of stars, is taken in as part of a symphony playing with your mind and soul. You see every constellation shining as one when it all comes together. In spite of the sombre aura that can linger throughout the black desert, one can still appreciate the ethereal beauty. A love-hate kind of romance arises. You still ache in love and worry about the coldness of it all at the same time."|0
I thought that the storyline came into place very well. I liked this movie a lot. If you're going to rag on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently somebody doesn't think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD for my room. That's how much I like it. I rather would not start an online argument with someone I don't know & have it be over a movie.|1
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD asap and watch it many times over. The story ends as it started I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor. Some stories do have happy endings.|1
"I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy ,  a bond had formed

Having the fortune to spend my time in the Naval life I had gained an in-depth perspective of the immeasurable sea life and power, such an unrelenting form of tranquility and elegance despite its erratic presence had an intoxicating feel. Its inviting appeal truly rejuvenated my faith and moved me to stop and stare during most moments. There were even a few memorable days in the spring when rain just halted and the sea silently blossomed."|0
Gary Busey 's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography . Since had a musical background , he was able to  convince audience when starred as Sonny Crocket , in films, such as Point Break and Life Cycles. Apart from acting, Busey had the interest for motorsports, eventually taking part in 2003 Bullrun Rally across United States, and 2003 Paris-Beijing rally. Other endeavors include restaurant ventures and painting which he started since 2013 and exhibited since 2016 respectively. One notable achievement includes receiving the last Platinum Schimdt Memorial Award in 2008 for significant achievement and extraordinary life with Humanitarianistic ideals.|0
OK , so this film may not have won any Oscars , but it is not a bad film . It has a great script and well developed characters that keeps the audience hooked from start to finish. The editing is tight and precise. Although some have complained about the soundtrack, the actors’ performances manage to carry the film well, showing their intense emotion and bringing the viewer in for a roller coaster ride. The climax and resolution make this a great story-telling journey. All-in-all, this is an underrated but amazing film that manages to stand tall amongst bigger-budgeted and mainstream projects.|0
I just saw this film and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.|1
`` Hari om '' is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name . Hari Om is the inspirational journey of a blind young man fighting poverty and prevailing over adversity with an ironclad faith in his guru and undying determination. During the film, the young man undergoes harsh trials and makes difficult sacrifices, until ultimately being rewarded with good fortune and lasting inner peace. Every step in his quest becomes a great life lesson to learn, and offers heartfelt inspiration to viewers who watch with reverence and admiration.|0
"This film , winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 ( tied with P.T . Anderson for  Punch-Drunk Love). This earned the highly acclaimed director an immediate well-deserved distinction and established Im's claim to ""Lee Sangsoo-isms"" - shots of windows, cellars and ghosts recurring in almost all his films- while expanding their narrative structures to accommodate films using motion and diverse composition that demand active rather than passive viewers. With time, it became a new epic to frame this and others of his films – subtitled versions including ""Two Mariners and Magic Sea""."|0
"`` Nuovomondo '' was a great experience . Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue . But this film had an effective approach with very minimal dialogue, telling its story mainly through camera angle, silence and powerful sound design. It depicted Italy of 1906 in beautiful frames while many socio-economic and ethical issues of the time period were nicely used. Through powerful visual storytelling techniques and structure, ""Nuovomondo"" created something deeply engaging. There are also a few poignant humanist moments present here and there throughout the film which appeal to the universal moral fibre."|0
Wow, What a wonderful film-making! Mr. Im has done it, again!His last work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great film, but this one is even greater. Selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year row, this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a Korean culture.Simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up' who was considered as a prodigy in the late Nineteenth century.|1
"The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 ""They Made Me a Criminal."" Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. Later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. And the whiskey.A problem develops when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose Bradfield's phony life on the front page."|1
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. It provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). It's the only place that I get my tech info. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... Universe.|1
I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it . It 's one  of those special kinds of movies that give you time to think after watching it. Despite the slightly underdeveloped plot, the underlying messages and idea have merit, making this movie valuable. As with any great film, each individual viewer interprets and digests their own message. I think that this movie can remind each of us, not only of our daily human weaknesses, but also the capacity to not just withstand difficulties and realities, but also ultimately a deeper appreciation of love.|0
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes  off to enlist confidently but realizes war is not all as fun and glamorous as he expected when his friends begin to die.He quickly goes from pride to terror and is terrified by the reality of battle, even accidentally killing an officer in fear.His comedic battle with a plane mid-flight still makes audience erupt in laughter despite the darkness surrounding him.His attitude is shaken to his core when an aerial explosion drives him over the brink and Charlie only starts to face up to the power of terror unleashed.|0
Always enjoyed `` DOA '' ,1950 , which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film . Dennis  O'Keefe did some directing and was uncredited . After a little digging, I learned that Ida Lupino and Barry Sullivan also star in this film. I was shocked by their participation. As far as I could find, the plot follows a deadly secret discovered by two young Canadian pilots whose small airplane crashes on the way back to their bases. However, I found out that Edmond O'Brien plays an undercover agent who uncovers international conspiracy! It has all the ingredients to make a very exciting film.|0
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a  single show? It was thought provoking to watch and gave so much insight into what its like living with a disability and living with diversity. Even those without disabilities, could take the message of appreciation for diversity that the show gives. Furthermore, this show shed light on various factors like patience, endurance, acceptance, encouragement and above all strong perseverance. All these can empower and make it easier for one to live harmoniously with a disability.|0
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He's in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success.It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.|1
A Formula For Murder isn't a well known Giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late on in the Giallo cycle, but more than stands up to many of the films released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. Despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes Argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters.|1
"Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I 've seen in a very  long time

I could go on and on, raving about this movie to anyone who will listen. My friends were blown away by how impactful the story was and the way it was executed. Although I am biased since I'm a huge fan of this director's work, I must say that he outdid himself with this one. Everything just meshed together and even small details, such as the captivating musical score, complimented the powerful visuals perfectly."|0
First of all, around the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not an actual movie. I mean, I myself would choose a good Deniro movie or playing a video game any day. But, dude, what are you talking about? Now that I have that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? The video game adaption of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name.|1
"The show start out with the boat . Desmond was i it . Then they went to try to save  everyone in the dock

They sailed their boat to the docks, but time was running out. The pressure of the situation made things tense. When they finally arrived they started their rescue mission, hurrying against the clock to save everyone in the dock. It wasn't easy and no one could know what could happen. Then just as the clock hit zero the crew manage to safe the last life, although barely on time, the tension ran high."|0
It 's Showtime ! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro 's careers . It 's  an entertaining movie filled with many gags, comedies, one liners and silly moments. The action scenes in Showtime were definitely interesting, as both Murphy and DeNiro acted out high-octane car chases and battle scenes. What I liked most, however, were the zany lines uttered between both actors and even the outrageous behavior they displayed while executing scenes. This collaboration was successful with two of the biggest stars in the movie industry performing their usual trade-mark antics on the screen, guaranteed to have the viewers laughing away.|0
James Franco is totally cool in this movie . Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in  his performance as a wanna be Hollywood Director . Franco takes the audiences on a ride, through every highs and lows in this unpredictable career. Despite having a roller coaster ride of his own , his upbeat presence works to reinforce an optimistic message at the heart of the movie that while our work may never receive any big, resounding wins and riches in response - our spirits should never break nor the fact that ‘A STAR IS BORN’.|0
My impression, having seen this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film. He took five years to make it, a labour of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take out. His father, the renowned architect Louis Kahn,comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity.|1
After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it just about succeeds.The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak.|1
"This is one of the best of the early ""Star Trek"" episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the ""Star Trek"" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin."|1
"I love this movie , though I do n't like how they picture Egyptians , being an Egyptian citizen myself 

Though I love this movie, as an Egyptian citizen, I'm disappointed in how they portrayed our culture and values. They brushed past the many detailed nuances and historical events that have impacted modern day Egyptian history and culture. What makes a movie powerful is the respect to which they dig deeper into the social issues of the region. When people experience something they wouldn't otherwise have seen without the movie, that leaves an impressionable mark, inspiring us to look past just the surface details."|0
"Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar  showed up one day

At first Edgar showed no animosity to Duchess or her kittens, often smiling when the adorable little family settled in together. As the months went on, though, Edgar became increasingly impatient, making harsh comments to Duchess's human mistress and often barking orders to keep Duchess and the kittens out of his way. Unwilling to tolerate this bullying any longer, the mistress moved to another house and made sure her loving pet family had everything they needed to remain safe and happy in their new environment."|0
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot . Some dude named Gerald  wanted to start fresh and move away. So he leaves his family and moves across the country, although he really feels lonely as soon as he lands in his new home. Soon enough, though, he finds solace in one of the friends he makes on a journey that eventually leads him into a web of crime and insanity. The struggles that Gerald experiences puts his idea of starting fresh on a challenging turn and Gerald becomes tangled in events far greater than he imagined.|0
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it.|1
"Jack , Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond . His traumatic past experience  forced him to burn down his shelter and there were hardly any survivals 

Sayid identifies that Desmond isn’t just some drifter on a solo boat but that he holds significant importance to the rest of their lives. Before long, the four men realize they all have a significant bond: they’re the sole survivors of Flight 815 crash on a desolate island, running away from their destinies.Desmond explains his travels around the world have given him key knowledge that may aid their understanding and help with getting off the island."|0
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about an ex-Viet Nam POW in Laos who escaped, but I didn't know much else. In reality, I wasn't expecting too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during WWII and the hardships.|1
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall  the film doesn't miss its mark. Although some of the plot may seem irrational, the characters take you through an exciting and comical journey. With catchy music and amusing lines, this teen movie keeps you hooked as the film progress. There is also an important message in the film as it allows one to reflect and think on certain things. Ultimately, while it has its unrealistic moments, it tells an interesting story that anyone who watches can relate to.|0
What a shame this movie was never released . ( It is now playing on cable . ) I tuned  into a station the other day and the trailer was airing ! I quickly ordered the movie On Demand, just so I can watch it as soon as possible. Even though the trailer seemed too good to be true, it still is pretty close to what was being presented. With some heart-racing moments and several dark scenes, it manages to surprise me again and again. Overall, it looks like this movie has gone down in cult cinema for those that enjoyed the crazy storyline and badass action scenes.|0
I thought this movie was pretty good!OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major Chad Michael Murray fan, but because i enjoyed it.|1
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard-pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time-capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time,space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could.HEAD is a reflection of those films. No matter how one feels about the Monkees, this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium.|1
"Ah the Outer Limits. I love that show. It was surpremely creepy, or down-right mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I must have started watching way after it got canceled, when Sci-fi showed it as re-runs, or played marathons of it. It was a really good show, I don't know all about the seasons and everything but I do remember that every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV say: ""There is nothing wrong with your television."|1
I am a guy, so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear likes to be in tear jerker movies. I would rather watch action/adventure/sci fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a tear jerker. Diane tended to over act a few times, as did richard, but they brought it around and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude, so you started out hating her. The movie is way too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece.|1
Being a middle aged mom myself, I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us. Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life herself. I am not a big Richard Gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk, but learns something about himself.Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies.|1
Well , I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning . So I ended up choosing something in the action/adventure genre that promised plenty of thrills and drama. When it came time to turn off the lights and press play, I was pretty pumped up with excitement. Even before I was 10 minutes in, the rollercoaster of excitement had been triggered and my full attention had been devoted to the story. The combination of storyline, directing, actors and effects had created an emotionally engaging spectacle.|0
To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series  ended, but that didn't mean the end for their stardom. Despite many failures and mistakes along the way, the Monkees earned a fan base and admirers of their classic hit records that endures to this day. A number of websites dedicate to the history of their creation, or simply applaud the skill they mastered over their two and a half years on television. Nowadays, the three-album long opus HEAD offers an homage to their influence and knack of imbuing four young rockers’ DNA in great comedy.|0
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade . She smokes and drinks . She does n't have a lot  of close friends . Jade is often judged by others who don't understand her unique identity. She seems isolated but enjoys nights out and trying out new places, although she'd never admit to it. Jenny Lewis plays Jade with charm and complexity. While at times her carefree attitude can be seen as an obstacle in life, she refuses to give into societal pressure, further inspiring the audiences watching. We see Jenny bring an underappreciated emotion of unapologetic self-love that only she can deliver.|0
This is a brilliant film. The story starts off in Romania,where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. There is a really funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river.|1
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from Sicially to the U.S. in the early days of the 20th century. It also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land.|1
"The movie is incredible, it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie. THe lines in the movie are great, such as ""Nothings to good for out friends"" and ""Its collection time Charlie collection time."" I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind. I feel that when i watch this movie I want to go out and shoot down bad guys, If there is a movie that you don't want to miss its this one."|1
"This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans . Okay I 'm sure it 's not as good as 

the older versions, but it's still very entertaining for me. What I liked about the movie is that it introduces a bunch of new characters that breathe new life into the classic horror genre. The visual effects were excellent, the dialogue was enjoyable, and the performances from the actors were amazing. It doesn't follow a traditional horror film style, it takes some new and fresh ideas from different films to give it a unique feel. All in all I enjoyed it a lot."|0
"I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former TV cop, brought in by Russo's character to coach the cops on how to be ""TV cops."" Those are by far the funniest scenes."|1
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important hostile alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh.|1
It took me a while to find this movie since they do n't have it yet on DVD ( and  it wasn't easy considering it had won 4 academy awards). Searching high and low in movie stores across my city I eventually found it in a local theatre’s antique archive. It was only available in VHS but the person who provided the copy had done a remarkable job transferring it over the years. Unfortunately, I couldn’t keep it since it was already on loan from a well established film museum but being able to see the movie itself after such a long search was nothing short of miraculous.|0
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International film Festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India....colorful, magical, thought provoking. Aside from one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor.|1
"When I first saw this movie , I also expected `` our boys '' to be cute , and more  on a magical side ,

I was taken aback a bit as it turned out to be nothing like that. There were magical elements in it, sure, but they were fewer than expected, with mostly involving an almost anti-hero like protagonist, strong presence of archetypes and problem solving with puzzles and mechanics. Despite this not being quite the type of movie I expected, I must admit it made a unique statement and had surprisingly memorable visuals."|0
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n ' roll . The young singer/songwriter  composed his own original songs that captured the innocence of early rock music and showed a promise of greater things to come. Sadly, he was killed at only 22 in a plane crash on the day that would become known as 'The day the music died' He had a real influence over generations to come, most prominently as a songwriter rather than a performer. The unique songs written in this era that later earned Holly a prestigious award remain inspirational, creative and musical discoveries still in existence today.|0
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's Academy Awards, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find out about his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. My Architect follows Kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings, and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius.|1
"""Pearl Harbor, buddy."" This movie is brilliant! Sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. I'm one that goes for silliness, much like ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Airplane"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece!"|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie. I am not saying this lightly. I love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are OK, a few I do not like at all). And, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It is light, funny, and very restful. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but I love it.|1
I 've commented once on this Chucky great , but I had to do it again to say some things  that I had previously omitted . He is by far the funniest doll out there, with a true aptitude for comedy that gives rise to side-splitting situations. He constantly cracks his inimitable and yet simple one liners, inviting the onlookers to chorus and become enamored with his spirit. Besides his compelling on screen performances, his gestures can keep viewers hooked throughout the movie. Truly, he brings sheer and solid laughter along with thrills and mystifying plotlines making the plot, memorable, capturing and to engage fans with continued adoration.|0
`` Showtime '' falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying , and a little south of what  might become required listening to stay in vogue. It is likely to satisfy fans looking for something specific in their listening. Its sonic playgrounds veer further and further away from radio's bland alternatives, enabling curious musical selections that remain near enough to traditional convention to evoke exciting emotion and explore personal sensations, each using melody and memory differently, revealing startling nuance in craft, precision and instrumental development that transport an audience well beyond those previous edges.|0
"""D.O.A"" is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his caustic best; and Quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, doesn't really make much of an impact. The film is stylishly directed throughout, drawing on a number of influences to capture its 'seamy' feel. Would you credit that it's actually directed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography."|1
This is Christmas time ! A nativity in terms of rebirth , or at least this is what can be  gained in reflection . It is this reminder of life, a literal embrace, and metaphor for all humankind - a treasured reflection that makes it hard to think about Christmas being celebrated apart from each other this year. After all, Christmas is about so much more than spending, it's a holiday dedicated to forgiveness, humility, and hope for a better tomorrow. No matter where in the world, the warmth of the Christmas spirit seems to span the miles in little squares and goblet in homes around the world.|0
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see. The acting, writing and production values are top-notch. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. However, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. It showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. It is thought provoking and entertaining. Congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie.|1
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary ( a lot ) - but he is funny ! He has some pretty wild comedic jokes and will have you laughing in no time . This time round, Chucky shows a completely new and different side. He isn't out to harm or bring fear - it's quite the opposite! He joins in on some of the group activities and becomes almost part of the gang, bringing laughs and plenty of silly antics. Even though his jokes may be a bit corny, Chucky puts on a performance sure to lift your spirits!|0
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. It's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on.|1
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. I taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four but my tape is severely worn now and I would love a new copy of it.I have e-mailed Film Four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as I know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. I have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. The performances are superb. The film has everything. Its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days.|1
It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD. I would most definitely purchase a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is, I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it.|1
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller-coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass up and says 'To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor.|1
"Wow , What a wonderful film-making ! Mr. Im has done it , again ! His last work , ChunHayang ManJeon , impressed me in many aspects :

Mr. Im once again amazes with this new film-making. The combination of symbolism and photography gives the audience a beautiful insight into human suffering and longing. The slow pacing of the film adds a special level of emotion. Characters of all ages, creeds, and lifestyles collide in powerful interactions throughout the film, shining a light on issues such as life and death, survival, justice and morality. Every scene feels absolutely real and alive."|0
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion, and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT.BLINDSPOT'S diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting  journey to the core of the human soul. As a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors. With superb editing, especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end. A thriller which leaves much to the minds' eye.What an  astounding accomplishment for Stephan Woloszczuk. Cheers Stephan!|1
where do we go from here ? that is the overriding question of this film . And make no mistake  it's a complex issue. What does the answer mean for us and for our future? To make it simple, is to do what we have always done- coming up with solutions that push our society to advance forward together and leave nobody behind. This includes acknowledging our mistakes in the past, accepting our responsibility and commitment towards the betterment of our fellow human beings, the environment and other creatures living on this planet.|0
"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song , and now the terrific Justin  has a spot in the Hall Of Fame 

The effect of his music did not go unnoticed -he left fans in tears and also achieved two number one albums during his successful music career. From that moment on Justin was respected by the media, fellow music industry artists and obviously a tremendous fan base from the success of all of his future hits. But it was in recognition of Justin’s substantial achievements in the industry he finally found himself nominated for induction into the famous and celebrated Hall Of Fame."|0
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. I found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. This was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular.|1
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. That's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!Next thing you know he's in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes here include a starving Charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.When Charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring.|1
When his elderly mother Emily ( Jeanne Bates ) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier ( Brion James )  Charlie races home. He is relieved to find that she's still alive and quickly goes about dispatching Nestor. He engages him in a knockdown, drag-out fight with him eventually coming out on top and binding Nestor up with a heavy, strong chain. The police arrive at Charlie's place of residence only to find Nestor looking worse for wear. In one of his first use of parental control Charlie forces Nestor to pay reparation money as punishment and a form of redress.|0
where do we go from here? that is the overriding question of this film. And make no mistake, 'mainly ETC. ', the 2003 effort from director john jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one.much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and I'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer.|1
I 've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie . I agree  that this is an interesting and interesting story that will provide viewers with some entertainment as they learn about the power of trust, determination, and personal exploration. The performances in Lost Horizons have received praise and prove the caliber of the story and its setting. For example, viewers will enjoy the courage of protagonist Dr. Joseph Buchan and the heartfelt encounters between Richard Carlson and Betsy Drake. As the characters embark on their adventures, the personal growth that is showcased will both captivate and evoke emotions from its viewers.|0
This is sweet . The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira  in the same series. The talented actress, besides Elvira and the Nurse with the Gonzongas, has a number of roles in other television shows and films. She has showcased her versatility, mastering comedic, and even some tragic, performances that have left the audiences mesmerized. As if to test her true mettle, the star plays a spy in an upcoming film which requires intensive choreographed fights. The demand is sure to put her physical, and more notably emotional, prowess to test.|0
When the new Outer Limits first started, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to wind down, most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the very best, and worst, of the series.Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining to the flops.1. Afterlife: As an institution, The U.S.A. military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention plain stupid.|1
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film . I have got to say that  it was one of the best experiences that I ever had. The movie was heart-warming and soul-stirring at the same time and each scene was more interesting than the last. There were even parts where you were on the edge of your seat because the film moved at such a captivating pace. Even during the middle and end of the film, where everyone knew the main characters had all been on a rough journey, the audience held back their tears.|0
OK , so I loved Rachael Ray before , but now , I ADORE her ! How innovative . I  saw this recipe where she used watermelon instead of traditional tomatoes in a BLT ! The recipe was unique but tasty , adding in fresh flavors that I hadn't thought of before. Plus , she showed ways to give a basic dish a flair. Rachael Ray uses both commonplace ingredients that most of us already have , but with uncommon cooking ideas. This always inspires me in the kitchen , to make something that might surprise my family and be scrumptious too.|0
"I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old . I had no idea who  he was and had never heard his music. The movie sparked something in me, however. Every scene where music was involved I just couldn't look away, and I just had this burning sensation within me that said ""this is amazing!"" I asked my parents who the guy was in the movie, and from then on, I had become a fan of Buddy Holly's music. Growing up, I sought out anything Buddy Holly-related and even managed to pick up guitar to recreate some of his beloved songs."|0
This movie , based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt , is one of the best films I 've  seen so far. Gerrit's struggle for self acceptance and understanding for who he truly is truly captivated me. The tension built between his religious background and his quest for individuality takes many unexpected turns. You won't see the ending coming. But despite all his doubts, the knowledge that in the end, one has the choice of whether to bow down to conventions or stand strong, determined to face all the barriers thrown your way was rewarding. There is something special in this movie.|0
I always liked this movie, I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what was that :P They don't look that way in Romania.. Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. And there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. It worths being seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love.|1
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already gone through so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very glad now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie.I won't give a synopsis of the plot, because other reviewers have already done that. But I will say that I don't understand comments that it's bleak, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic.|1
"When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel , I have to say 

I was instantly hooked. With it's dynamic cast, exotic settings and twists, turns and suspense this show was unlike anything I had seen before. Each episode unfolds its story in unexpected directions. Every episode keeps me captivated, on the edge of my seat, eager to find out what will happen next. From intimate character exploration to thrilling sequences and the adventure never ends, the stakes become ever more thrilling and make the episodes gripping."|0
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard ( Beau Travail ) , Golden Door is a visually striking tone -poem, emphasizing both its overall fantastical appeal and deeper emotive aspects. As such, subtle conversations and philosophical questions are part of the canvas - manifested through Gianna's plea for her son's escape from poverty. Failing her families income to surpass the rate of imposts. The medieval geography provides not just poetic landscape imagery, but communicates man's strugglje in its permanent circumstances, chaste undercurrent and fuctional diplomacy a pivotal focus ofthe golden door experience.|0
"After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode (""Three Minutes""), the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is. With the use of the boat, Jack and Sayid come up with a plan to confront ""The Others"". However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael to ""The Others"", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret whilst they are in the middle of nowhere.Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time has come to find out the time has come to find out what will happen if ""the button"" is not pressed."|1
What's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... Here is my forecast: 1. The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. Buts lets see about that. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3.|1
"This is a stunning movie . Raw and sublimely moving . It felt like a very gripping , intelligent stage  adaptation

This movie left me shaken. There were multiple dramatic scenes where emotions were absolutely palpable. The subtle direction helped move the story along. It captures small moments like no other. I was in awe throughout the entire show, deeply invested in the characters’ relationships and arcs. As I was so wrapped in the gripping tale that slowly reveals itself, I couldn’t help feeling both gratified and impacted by it."|0
"Lucio Fulci 's `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by  ingrained poverty and ancient superstitions

Lucio Fulci's film tells a disheartening tale of a family crippled by abject poverty and hampered by primitive, oppressive attitudes. In his devastating vision of rural Italy, hostility pervades and prejudice runs rampant, epitomizing Fulci's conviction that secluded poverty instills generations of sickness. The turbulent emotional environment presented serves as an unlikely platform for newfound courage, when a lowly gaggle of brave kids attempts to reveal a treacherous secret."|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways . It is visually stunning , and this is a good thing since  it tells a powerful story . The story is beautifully intertwined with suspenseful musical arrangements to capture the heart and attention of any movie lover. Each scene and setting are accurately depicted in great detail with the aid of top of the line visual effects that are unparalleled in quality. It gives the audience a true window into what it was like in the times the film was made. Actors who star in this movie give genuinely captivating performances and powerful dialogues that fill in many emotional depths throughout the film.|0
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!!|1
"I do n't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch  in the background

As a result, I ended up with this particular movie, having seen all of the major trailers and expecting something mildly amusing. To my surprise, I was highly entertained and pleased by the ending. It was original and clever, and made the story come alive. My previous indifference toward the movie transformed into genuine appreciation for the fresh concepts it was promoting. Now, this movie tops my list of the best genre flicks, despite the clichés in it."|0
The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ( `` The Antichrist '' , `` The Killer is on  the Phone '' ) received little fanfare. Unfortunately, it was a much lesser film compared to De Martino's earlier ones. Despite a riveting soundtrack, the dialogue and character development were painfully unconvincing and overused. Many felt the movie was full of potential and what it lacked was someone behind the camera that could fill in those glaring gaps. Fans eagerly awaited to see if Alberto De Martino had it in him to make another amazing movie; one with tight storytelling, pacing, and characters that audience could connect to.|0
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still I enjoyed it. This time, Charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them. Death Wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and I enjoyed it every single second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page providing the music, with producers Golan and Globus still doing there thing and Charles Bronson is still acting good for Paul Kersey.|1
At one time ` Buddy Cop ' movies ruled the box office . It seemed that every summer flocks of  people rushed to theatres to experience the adrenaline-inducing action-packed plots that filled their nights. It was common knowledge that Hollywood had hit on a good formula and was sure to capitalize on its success. Eventually the excitement subsided and these movies disappeared from theatres just as fast as they had become the hottest thing on the block. But nostalgia from those glory days remains in the memories of those movie fans lucky enough to have lived it, if only for a summer.|0
I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. It's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, John Garfield.Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers.|1
( Some spoilers included : ) Although , many commentators have called this film surreal , the term fits poorly  . This movie is much better defined by other words like awe-inspiring, wondrous, and life-changing. The protagonists walk a careful tightrope, doing good and striving for something bigger and better for themselves as well as for their respective communities. Much like their situations, each character is subject to extremes of courage and tragedy; tremendous moments of levity and unfathomable darkness. Although ultimately satisfying, this movie is a narrative balancing act in more ways than one and isn't the kind of work that people easily forget.|0
The writers of lost have outdone themselves. Season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one. Locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself, but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island? He will have to if he wants to stay alive. I don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge.|1
I love this movie, though I don't like how they picture Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch Augustin's reaction.. All in all I find it enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to reading the short story by Balzac.|1
I saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been sitting by my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking through the whole thing. He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted.|1
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage in places. This is true, and is the biggest flaw of this film. However, it isn't so often, or so bad, that one shouldn't see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see this. Aside from having seen Black Sabbath in the Sevnties and early Eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined OZZfest just like in this video.|1
"The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort , and Charlie Chaplin was no  exception

He released the critically acclaimed ""The Great Dictator"" in 1940, which became an overnight sensation in the United States and overseas. Charlie Chaplin openly showed his disapproval of Adolf Hitler, with this epic propaganda film that showcased the challenges of anti-semitism and terrorism. Following this, the US Office of War Information asked Chaplin to use his cinematic voice and support US Bonds by speaking during war drives throughout the country. This was one of Chaplin’s proudest and most enduring acts for America during wartime."|0
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie . I caught it last night on TMC . It immediately caught my attention. The main character was interesting, the music was perfect, and the dialogues flowed wonderfully. I thought the director had done a superb job with making the scenes very vivid and the drama was heartfelt and emotionally complex. I especially loved how the love story progressed, it wasn’t rushed but taken its own sweet time to take a realistic and bittersweet shape. The photography, pacing, lighting and music fit so perfectly, and combined it told a magical story.|0
"This film, like much of their music, is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is terrific and, in many ways, ahead of its time.The images are funny, disturbing, and at the very least, engaging. The music is amazing. This is not the ""candy pop"" sound they are unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt.HEAD, alone, should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there?"|1
This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters  later that year. The trilogy was largely met with enthusiasm, gaining respect for Chapin's experimental film-making. While the three shorts alone made barely enough profit to cover production costs, the compilation secured long-lasting attention in critical circles, earning Chapin prestigious awards. Having caught the attention of famed filmmakers such as François Truffaut and Andrei Tarkovsky, this short served as a demonstration of Chapin’s versatile direction and budding filmmaking techniques. Its relative success furthered Chapin’s drive to venture into newer and bigger films.|0
"The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black, and the agency needs a ""token"" on the board. Swope is ignoring the meeting, reading Jet magazine at the big table, and everybody is ignoring Swope... Suddenly, the CEO croaks on the spot. No time is wasted. A janitor is called to haul off the corpse, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new CEO."|1
'Captain Corelli 's Mandolin ' is a fantastic film in itself . It is nothing like the book , which  it is based upon. It has moments of magic and levity as we journey through Greece under Italian control, but with World War Two just round the corner. Though it carries its own spin on Louis De Bernieres' epic book, the movie proves itself just as emotionally touching as the original tale. Much of the magic of the movie comes from Nicolas Cage's spectacular acting - delivering a believable performance that reminds us of both the peril and comradery in those troubling days.|0
This is a 100 % improvement over the dross of a third movie and it 's one hell of a  final instalment. It proved that the franchise was meant to reach a remarkable peak and remain just as captivating to audiences long after its end. Of course, with all its action, emotion, drama and wonderful new characters, the grand finale made the world that once started off so promising, incredible once more. By sticking to its strengths, the movie managed to wrap up its adventure with finesse and panache while delivering powerful messages of companionship, morality and motivation.|0
Let me clarify that . This is not a `` good movie '' , but I am so glad it  is one of the choices on offer. The other two films on offer do not appeal to me so this one was the obvious pick for tonight's movie night. It does not require much attention as its genre can sometimes make movies tedious. Although it is not the ideal movie for our movie night, I'm quite sure that all of us will enjoy watching it to some degree. Despite this, we still plan on having a fun evening filled with popcorn, conversations and laughter.|0
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and Court TV can be relied on for a few every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.Both the brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame.|1
As with so many modern US films , there has to be a supernatural element to the plot , but  the writers don’t rely too heavily on this aspect and ensure that it does not take away from the human drama in the narrative. Instead it serves to highlight the underlying themes, bringing a kind of foreboding mood that tenses the audience up until the climactic resolution. The storyline has plenty of unexpected turns, as characters behave contrary to what you would normally expect, while important questions remain unanswered and invite multiple interpretations.|0
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.This is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see it now- FANTASTIC!The acting is excellent, and Dublin plays a starring role. This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. I can't wait til it comes out on DVD.|1
"The ""old dark house"" sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. Here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he must die that very night. Meanwhile the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs."|1
This is a good film , no doubt , but with some odd aspects . Without spoiling anything it takes  a twist in the middle , with one character (Kaya ) becoming someone who nobody saw coming. Kaya ends up leading her newfound life to success, pushing back any doubts that surround her character. Her courage and ambition shown give her character the motivation to keep on moving forward no matter the opposition. In the end it creates a moral which adds even more to the twist and unexpected aspects which gave the film its excitement.|0
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! Hat's off to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. I watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. This film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world.|1
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title. The movie was cool,despite the fact, I hate new ones! All of the cast was awesome . It has great cast and an awesome plot!! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder , neat eh? !Dennis Quaid is the man who is ""D.O.A""(in other words Dead On Arrival).He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect! !Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him."|1
"The cover of the VHS says it all: ""Without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and I have to say, I agree 100 %. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forest-ranger). There's the twisted atmosphere, that only TCM has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror."|1
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange . I was confused , sad  and i could hardly think straight. It has been days and I am still trying to find words that could justify my feelings. The scene which depicts the closeness of a father and daughter during the funeral stirred all sorts of emotion in my mind. I felt heartbroken and could almost feel the characters' pain in my own body. This film truly showcased how one should value and treasure their relations before it's too late.|0
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons, and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out. I must admit, season one is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one.The episode begins with the family playing a game of Scrabble to get Bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he needs to. He spells out a word that angers Homer and he chases Bart around the house.|1
Oh my word ! ! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or  ethical standards. The acting was horrid, and the plot didn't really take off until halfway through. There was too much over-the-top romance and violence that should have been left out of a movie in the first place. Moreover, the scenes weren't linked well and at times, I found it difficult to understand why characters behaved in certain ways. The film did have its fair share of merits though. But overall, this wasn't the kind of experience I had expected from the promotional materials I saw.|0
"The best thing from the American Pie `` bakery . '' I found the humor and the plot to be  well done, with enough twists and turns that kept me guessing and entertained. It's not just the writing and acting that draw me in; the character arcs were unique, allowing me to feel what the characters were feeling as they progressed through their stories. And who can forget the memorable soundtrack and Alanis Morrisette's single? I left the cinema humming the ""Goodbye, Little Lame duck, Goodbye"" as I strolled out the door."|0
I would say 'Bride of Chucky ' is a `` return to greatness '' but the series was never really  known as that to begin with. The franchise is really built on the idea of laughs, blood and nastiness. Bride of Chucky isn't trying to scare anyone like the original did. Instead, the creators shifted focus to clever, off-color jokes with an almost loving emphasis on clever dialogue and physical gags. That could turn some people off, as Bride of Chucky focuses heavily on that style of filmmaking that was born from popular horror flicks of the 90s and 00s.|0
"I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series -- my only detraction would  be

I don't think any other episode got quite so far down in the minutiae and characters the same way. While this depth gave viewers a profound glimpse at our show's iconic universe, some long-time fans felt disconnected because of the sporadic lack of main characters, some fans worrying this could signal the demise of the show. Overall however, most of the responses to this episode were extremely positive and proved it would only boost the show's presence going into the next season."|0
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot.|1
1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and obnoxious. Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Prince's feature film career for several years.The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it is a mad farce/satire that has to be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here.|1
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and for about as long as I've known his name, I've also looked for this movie. I tried looking for this movie all over California for over four years. this past summer i took a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, I bought it and watched it in France! I was blown away, it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen Luc Besson's first work.|1
Loved today 's show ! ! ! It was a variety and not solely cooking ( which would have been  great). I loved seeing all the talented people involved. It was nice to get a break from cooking to be reminded that variety can have great show appeal too. Everything was perfect- the acts, the guests and the energy of the studio. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Best of all, I could connect and interact with people around the world who shared my enthusiasm for the show. It's safe to say this was truly a successful show and I'm sure there will be much more to come.|0
"I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development . Fulci was a master at creating horrific  suspense which was a hallmark of his later movies

In terms of violence and gore he spares no one in 'Zombie', with its confrontational shock cuts, avant-garde angles and hallucinogenic graphics. Zombie marked a significant shift in the content and graphic displays used in horror cinema and prefigured the modern popularization of slasher movies that emerged a few years later. Its depiction of inescapable fate and ultimately unbearable levels of despair are emblematic of his unique brand of storytelling."|0
"Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I'm wondering why Cagney wasn't in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole ""swimming"" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly miscast."|1
Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful  status as 'maestro of the macabre'. Since the beginning of his career Fulci went against traditional, cinematic conventions. While Zombie Flesh Eaters became an undisputed cult-classic of it’s era, some of Fulci’s more absurd works have more recently become recognized as cult masterpieces. From oddball comedies like Now They Call Him Sacramento and Frankenstein '80 to horror-filled supernatural titles such as The Psychic and A Cat In The Brain.|0
"I saw this film at a small screening . Even though it had a low budget , the creative direction  , photography and musical score was stunning

The actors managed to showcase excellent performances despite the conditions they were put through. The emotional rawness that portrayed by the director at its heart, cut right into my own emotional vulnerability. Themes of identity, prejudice, culture and inner growth stood at the core of the story and completely engulfed me throughout the entire viewing experience. It's safe to say I left feeling quite breathless, all inspired to be better than who I was before."|0
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. I tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. The film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. It's one of my favorite slasher films and I have no idea where an uncut version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the USA where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen.|1
Is this a good movie ? It 's hard to say -- but in 1953 , for many people ,  this movie was ground-breaking. This classic comedy broke traditional conceptions of both comedy and societal values and left viewers with a classic but timeless message.It inspired some classic films today that draw heavily on the iconic tropes used in the movie. Moreover, a box-office success it pushed the boundaries of the way people view comedy films in that era and has even made an impact up until the modern era.In conclusion, while opinions on this film may vary, its history has left a cultural impact beyond what anyone in 1953 would have predicted.|0
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how did she end up in the same hospital Hurley was in) then you should know that despited Libby dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her.BTW, great episode. It had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions...like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four toe statue?I cannot wait till season 3, Lost just rules!!!|1
Barbora Bobulova's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by utilizing her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way Barbora does with this character. She was entirely believable as Valeria and I was swept away with her characterisation of this role. All at once the film was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound.|1
I ca n't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I 've described  the show to other people. Friends has definitely found a special place in my heart. The writers were genius when creating jokes and relatable situations, which always lead to hilarious scenes. The timing between the actors were superb and it made every line of dialogue even funnier. Whenever I watch the show, I always pick up something new I didn't notice before, adding an extra layer to the already brilliantly constructed show.|0
"NOBODY ( 1999 ) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir . It 's about three salarymen who get in  a crazy triangle with a cold female contract killer

NOBODY is a neo-noir thriller which portrays these three characters facing ethical dilemmas as they become entwined in an intensely personal journey filled with violence and guilt. Along the way, these anti-heroes battle inner turmoil, revenge, manipulation and addiction. The central theme of the film is each man's personal pursuit of salvation through exploring the ideas of existential justice and redemption in a world with few values."|0
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre . Set in  Paris and with many comedic elements, it works as both a police procedural and murder mystery. Fulci uses elements such as wide shots of the streets and opera interspersed to create a surreal yet riveting experience that starts of somewhat quietly and slowly builds up to the point of pure hysteria. Certain trademark effects like gliding shots of body and blood splashes, striking several different techniques present in the master's work, give The psychic an intriguing stamp to set it apart from the standard whodunit thriller.|0
Spike Milligan 's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years , and 2002 's 'Puckoon ' is  a testament to the success of his most humorous works. Puckoon is widely considered to be a cult classic, thanks to its subversive comedic touches and brazen attacks on cultural norms. Additionally, his own improvisations became deeply etched into popular culture with catchphrases such as ‘Oah howanylikeemgeeve'” immortalized in English vocabulary and on TV series dedicated to him and other humorous performances. Milligan's satirical messages and lampooning has secured his works an undeniable presence in popular entertainment, continuing to live on long after his death in 2002.|0
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. As the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio.|1
"Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji , a Japanese poet and writer who was active in  the Meiji and Taisho eras

The biopic brings together experts on Miyazawa’s works and recollections from the people of Hanamaki city (Miyazawa’s hometown). While speaking on Miyazawa, people recollected events and personal stories; painting a deeper portrait of this complicated artist and unveiling his themes on environment, art, society and religion. As per a senior lecturer of the Miyazawa Institute at Iwate University of Health and Welfare - 'Everything has in the form of Spirituality in his works and any translation effort could ruin that meaning."|0
"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, by the process, their own lives are not that uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unsubtle quest for publicly-splashed revenge for countless past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and ""My Architect: A Son's Journey"" is that rare achievement.Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident."|1
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. Reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called Motorama. He has to find all eight letters in order to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. He runs into some deranged Lynch like characters. Most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that God will see it.|1
This movie was great. It had everything a true action fan could want. Plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with, violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end, and villains that are just asking for it. Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again.|1
Hey look, you don't watch this movie to change your life! But if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for Richard Gere; this movie is right up your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have on screen chemistry going way back. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not a Oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED good looking people (they don't make your stomach turn and even when Gere is 'on top' he does not look too jowly) then this is the movie for you.|1
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos . The appeal of Ali G extended across to movie roles too. He had cameos in Mike Meyers' 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me', and featured as the lead in 'Ali G Indahouse'. He also featured as himself alongside comedians Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell in 'The Playboy of Beverly Hills' in 2004. From presenting the red carpet show of the 81st Academy Awards to contributing voices to successful movie franchises like the Madagascar series, Ali G has left his stamp on movie making too.|0
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in the making, one would be hard-pressed to expect any less. I did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones, which is naturally only a minor gripe.David Attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative, leaving enough room for one's imagination, and well spaced out, so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery.|1
"If you've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu zinger! In 1933 Mae Questel caricatured Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip Popeye. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does her best ""Olive Oyl"" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. I kept waiting for her to say ""ohhh myyyy"", but instead it's ""something always happens to somebody."" The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny."|1
As an English teacher , I appreciate films that do more than tell a story . Good films , like  good literature , can transport us to another place and allow us to explore other perspectives . They challenge us to rethink our opinions, opinions and stimulate lively debates among friends . What's more, the use of audio and visuals help to truly bring a movie alive and make learning much easier . Consequently, using movies in the language classroom is a valuable asset which helps make learning an enjoyable and meaningful experience for all.|0
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White , Cinderella , or Bambi , but it IS a very  respectable story in its own right

In spite of being no classic like Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, this story offers an entertaining and heartfelt experience in its own right. With mesmerizing visuals and heart warming story, the movie quickly rises to an unexpectedly positive level. The story puts children and adults alike on an imaginative and heartful roller coaster ride with gentle storylines, friendly characters and interesting settings that draw viewers in to a whole different universe."|0
"While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously , its primarily directed  at 

I think it is beneficial for the younger generations who still have some attachments with our more traditional media as this movie paints a broader picture and brings more understanding about our differences. Its unique spin also celebrates all forms of traditional culture, heritage and celebration, especially in times when such diverse social issues might seem hidden away. What is more, it should also remind adults to pay tribute to a growing complexity of our rich society while young people are given an open look at the history and belief."|0
When I was 10 (currently 14), I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done pretty well, except for Shakespere for English class...etc...I was still only watching things that ended happy. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. After seeing this a few times over the two or so years since I first saw it, I grew to like it, especially the music.|1
This is possibly one of my favorite films. It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. However, on her birthday the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.I thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast.|1
"Ah the Outer Limits . I love that show . It was surpremely creepy , or down-right mysterious . I  know it gave me and countless others a plethora of nightmare scenarios. The plot twists, the shadowy beings, and most of all the soundtrack and famous tagline ""There is nothing wrong with your television set, do not attempt to adjust the picture"" had me gripped and paranoid with fear that someone or something was going to come through my TV and swallow me into oblivion. I guess that is what happens when we stay up late watching eerie supernatural stories."|0
Even after nearly 20 years apart , the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing . In  recent interviews, all the members express a joy and excitement that extends far beyond just music. With the full line-up reunited, their live shows quickly gained new, and unexpected fans. With their simple but powerful performances, their legacy of unruly fans was continuing on with renewed energy, who not only loved their older songs, but would accept the new musical experiments with genuine excitement. With each album or show, their stature increased, culminating with their eventual induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.|0
I never thought I'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad).|1
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of ""The English Patient,"" even down to a scene similar to when Ralph Fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. In ""A Passion in the Desert,"" the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. Final shot will haunt me for weeks."|1
I Loved this movie . Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role . More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade . Although remakes of classic films can evoke mixed feelings, it's important that classic films be refreshed to be appreciated by newer generations. Of course, there will always be debates on the creative ways they are re-envisioned. Mark Blankfield was particularly ideal in this role - giving depth and clarity to his character, whilst providing some fun performances at the same time. For classic sci/fi and horror films, hopefully more directors would put more thought and care into this craft so more excellent films could emerge.|0
"What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode , beside Peter Falk , you have Julie Newmar  , Karl Maiden , Linde Alfhelt

Every other character acted amazingly too; Barbara Baldavin plays Marilyn Mason and together with her sister they conspire to kill her brother played by Liam Dunn. Caroline Ellis is Emmy their Grandma and yet a fine art historian and Arch Bain as Edgar Murray as a traditional businessman trying to hide an evil motive. Last but not least Cally Steele as Cynthia Kane is sweet, efficient, reliable and also supports in other leads attempts of stopping the crime being uncovered."|0
WTF!! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending?? The Notebook was good...but sheesh, enough with the depressing endings already. I'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable...but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days. Don't we already know what really happens in real life?|1
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. In 1969, the transition among African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. Special mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery.|1
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm .... Only that this was one  of the creepiest and most wonderful shows that was created by imaginative and creative individuals. It surely elevated the horror anthology show to greater heights. The cast and writers added great elements that made it much better than the other genre programs out there. Through special effects and technology the show was able to craft episodes that grabbed the audiences’ attention in ways previously unimaginable. Even decades after it first aired, people still discuss the mysteries, conundrums and universes that the show has presented to viewers.|0
"When I first saw this movie,I also expected ""our boys"" to be cute,and more like an extended version of the TV show. I didn't ""get it"" back then. But,years later,at a party YEARS later,at a 70s' type PAR-TAY,where certain substances had been smoked,inhaled,and with plenty of tequila,""HEAD"" was on late at night.We watched it,and finally realized what ""HEAD"" was all about. It spoofed their own show,as shown in one song that called themselves,""a manufactured image""."|1
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. If you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like Hansel and Gretel then he and his wife go home with them. The soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: ""Inspection officer -- Here!"""|1
"A very weird , psychedelic , esoteric , ( and did I say weird ? : ) experience.But on at  least one level, it was curiously thought provoking,

Bringing with it a sense of hope; a resolve, a seed of opportunity, lingering and visible through the strange tones and visuals. I was able to make sense of what I felt, as opposed to sitting back in wonderment, to distill this all encompassing stream into a language that worked for me. Despite all its outward chaos, the essence of my trip still proved accessible, inspiring a sort of growing freedom to tackle life in a fresh, clearer perspective."|0
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title . The movie was cool , despite  its weak start

The first act felt like a high school drama with clichés and predictability, however the suspense of the story developed with surprising action sequences and stunning effects. Each actor brought charm and ferocity to their performances and the actors’ dynamics played to the unpredictability of their adventure. The narrative held tight tension and continual moments of high stakes, supported by powerful and contemporary musical selections. At the heart of it, the movie held a beautiful statement on living courageously."|0
"This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live . I know personally most  of the people that are in it and even saw many of them while they were filming it

Watching the film I could connect more to the people that are actually here instead of some Hollywood movie that portrays reality wrong. Most people featured have direct connections to this city's rich culture and years of history. Watching it was very heartwarming to me, especially when you feel that the persons you see are the same people you were able to share important moments of your life."|0
This is one of Chaplin 's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more  emotionally expansive feature films. This was an influential and renowned film at the time of its release and many filmgoers proclaimed Chaplin as one of the funniest comedians and lauded his dramatic skills too. With this feature, Chaplin gave further support to the culture of strong storytelling, sensational soundtrack and equally important iconic characters to facilitate emotional catharsis. He worked hard to bridge the art of technical and emotional significance; consequently gaining plaudits from contemporaries and remaining a culturally valid watch to this very day.|0
"i did not read the book. nor do i care to. the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it. no, it was not a ""10"" film, but it was enjoyable. women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on ""in love"" and ""loving. ""also, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny. i enjoyed watching the developing romance. also, if you like Christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium."|1
"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted."|1
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ""not human"" is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film."|1
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy, so I am somewhat biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the film is amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, to see 200 ton Blue Whales 'cruising' through the Sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines.|1
"When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for  a way to get the film made

Eventually, I decided to invest in the project, bringing together several financiers, finding a director and constructing the screenplay. After five months of hard work, production started. I soon discovered that this journey was both interesting and hard. Dealing with multiple companies and hiring of talents put a tremendous amount of pressure on my shoulders. I needed to deliver something great as every film I supported became part of my reputation."|0
"Is this a good movie? It's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when ""the old gentleman"" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.Yes, what lurks in the Maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact."|1
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage . Many believe this move provides insight into how fans feel as they experience the music. Not only is there great appreciation for the joy of being at a live performance, but we are also presented with fans contemplating and reflecting upon the raw emotion and intimacy within each track. We witness what it is like to express music, live on stage and how it makes the audience feels – powerful, thought provoking and the slightest hint of inspiration and discovery.|0
This movie felt so real. I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy like Rory so what you see here is exactly what I've actually felt myself. Some won't believe there ARE disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them.The story is great. For a drama, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I was never bored, maybe partly because I was seeing stuff that is close to my heart.|1
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply . I 've been looking  for this hard to find DVD from my favourite classic film but none of the shops I look in stock it. The idea that these companies will choose not to rerelease their films frustrates me as the consumers in these cases are not those looking for financial benefit, just an enjoyable film night. Recently the rare and highly sort after gem of classic films seems more of a war-chest kept hidden away rather than material to benefit a greater audience.|0
Great show ! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps . Contestants range in ages  of anywhere from late teens to senior citizens - it's a great combination of learning , loving, teaching and making memories. The interactions between the young and older generations have truly made the show stand out. Together they work through age-appropriate challenges while getting to know one another, showing the viewers that there really is nothing like connecting over similar interests despite our generational gap. Seeing that there are lessons to be learnt from both young and old has enabled viewers of all ages to connect.|0
Blind Spot 's images are great . The action draws you in completely , even though the movie is a  bit dated now . The cinematography also stands out as impressive, from wide shots of locations that are vivid and arresting, to extreme closeups that capture tiny nuances of the character's emotions. While the plot itself takes a few confusing turns along the way, this only adds to the story's compelling narrative. Each character's motivations become all the more thrilling when obscured by the complexity of the overarching plot, forcing viewers to take their own imaginative leap.|0
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.The film integrated excerpts of Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom.|1
"The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special `` Simpson 's Roasting On An Open Fire '' which had  first aired in 1989

The show got enormous critical praise and gained millions of loyal viewers around the world and launched an empire that's continued for more than two decades and four hundred episodes. The Simpson's hit us right in the nostalgic heartstrings. Not only were the shows actually hilarious, and frequently delved into ridiculous sitchs that show like '' South Park '' wouldn't even consider touching but they reminded us what family really meant in it's truer form."|0
But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning.I'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not Medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic.|1
I think it definitely is . The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language  could use it for example. Writing as a tool for learning English has so many benefits. Firstly, reading can be a great source of guidance in language, not just from English experts, but from learners as well. It’s much easier to see and appreciate something in a creative story than the cut and dry of a workbook. Additionally, speaking exercises, activities, games and songs can really put life and variety into the language learning experience.|0
"I don't see that much wrong with this movie. Granted, the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly carry a tune. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I happen to love their songs, especially ""The World Is A Circle"", ""The Things That I Will Not Miss"", and ""Question Me An Answer"". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic; I disagree on both counts."|1
"It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It memorializes the NY city mind set of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, hoist by by own petard, and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they ""really are""... I don't think it is ever shown anymore. If so, surely someone would Tivo the thing and put it out there."|1
"My impression , having seen this documentary , is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had  answers 

Overall, what stands out is the importance of preserving one’s legacy even if this legacy isn’t solid. At the same time, his personal attachment to what he believed was Louis’s influence was evident even if there was ultimately a lack of tangible connection. Ultimately, it isn't what's concrete that gives substance, it is one’s impressions and memories that provide comfort and shared insight on not only life in general but individual legacies that otherwise might be lost."|0
Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time . Excellent original music , clever , heady ... it  deserves attention for its well-conceived plot, unforgettable characters and well-crafted laughs. The characters are unforgettable as are their onscreen dynamics. Their clever wit is smart, wry and wholly enjoyable as they move through various interactions in a relentless adventure of getting what they want and usually succeeding. Its saucy plot leaves no character unscathed as they go after everything from securing ransom money to honoring marital ties and gaining a lesson in common courtesy. The unpredictability is downright exciting as everyone from old favorites to bit players join the film's irreverent comedy.|0
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I 've ever seen . Not only it 's  unique story, it's sophisticated character stories within it and subtle meaningful references made it special. The clever balance of mysticism, emotional depth and metaphorical abstract concepts, as well as dramatic peaks, greatly attract viewers and captivate them to watch until the very end of the series. Especially, its ability to contrast humour with gripping mystery left me satisfied but thirsty for more. Each characters’ emotional investment was brilliantly translated, thanks to amazing work by each actor, not to mention exceptional storytelling.|0
The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 `` They Made Me a Criminal . '' John Garfield went on to become a household name, landing lead roles in hit films like Golden Boy and Prisoner of Zenda. Audiences were particularly mesmerized by his characters that defied conventions, most notably his portryal of gentle gangster Joe in Castile Knoll and determined union activist in Army Tentmaker. He showcased remarkable skills in dark characters that not many other actors could imitate at the time,and stole the hearts of cinephiles worldwide.|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I have lived here my whole life), I have waited for this movie to come out. And I mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.The movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and I smiled just as much.|1
I thought it was brilliant! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed in looks, neither had Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as dishy! I thought that Mr T looked thinner though, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. I thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr T could'nt make the actual reunion.|1
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. True, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream American production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I easily dare to call this film a masterpieceit's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror.|1
Can the intensity of a husband 's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime , despite  all his inner conscience urging him not to ? Though he may try his best to deceive his inner conscious and take his stand despite being apprehensive, a real answer can only be gained with time. For instance, he may allow her to hide important evidence thus disregarding the righteousness, but the ultimate test of how deep his love goes and how long will this unbreakable bond remain, will always depend on the pressure of truth he ultimately comes to face.|0
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but, Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall.|1
Years ago when I first read John Irving's The World According to Garp, I was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. I experienced somewhat of a déjà vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Separate Lies is surely an age and experience thing.In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he a successful lawyer - she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer.|1
This movie is true action at its finest , It does n't get any better then this . This is  one of my all time favorite movies . The amazing cinematography, spectacular effects and astounding soundtrack come together to make a real thrill-fest for movie-goers of any age. The best thing about this movie is its overall content: suspense, fights, and its extremely intense characters, no wonder it leaves people breathless and engrossed at the same time. Furthermore, there is a healthy mix of thrills and comedy in the story as well.|0
"A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman : TAS and its ilk , I enjoyed it in  so many different ways

Teen Titans Go was the biggest surprise to me when it came to an excellent cartoon show. It is different from Batman: TAS and its ilk in many aspects and was exciting to watch. I loved it for its comedic elements that are seamlessly combined with storylines in the most unconventional manner. It offers a captivating experience even without engaging themes like violence or criminal dealings, but it also brings such matters to the viewers."|0
"The best thing from the American Pie ""bakery."" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision."|1
"OK, so this film may not have won any Oscars, but it is not a bad film. The original ""D.O.A."" is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after ""The Right Stuff"" made him a star, and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous.This is more of an ""update"" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different."|1
"1930 's comedy mystery about `` The Crooked Circle '' a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the  ""The Big Game."" The Big Game promised the Crooked Circle enough wealth and fortune to retire on for many years, until something completely unforeseen came about to alter the fortunes of The Big Game. This unforeseen circumstance left the Circle stuck between a rock and a hard place, with only themselves to blame for their current circumstances. Unable to turn to the law, their one chance at hope lies with a comedy-mystery solving duo who specialize in criminal affairs of the outrageous kind."|0

"Well , what 's wrong with the title `` Separate Lies '' ( accused elsewhere of not being `` exciting  enough '')

The title can evoke many different interpretations. Perhaps it references how the lies a person tells about their actions often cause fractures in relationships. Or, it could indicate how no matter how well we try to stay intertwined and connected with people in our lives, things will ultimately cause separation in some form or another. Overall, the title can be seen as thought-provoking; separating what was once seen as inseparable."|0
If you haven't seen this film, do it. Its a genremix as i've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny stuff, a film noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best played orgasm on Film, bested only by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles blended together into a work of art. As an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end, at least not logical for everybody ;-). I owned an tv copy on VHS but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back.|1
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel,I have to say out of all the shows that I've seen that ADV released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again,and that's when I got my chance. I bought the entire box set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th Birthday. And I got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that I missed on Action Channel,and the same 3 episodes that I've seen.|1
"In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling . Although Fulci had become a critically acclaimed filmmaker over the previous years with several box office successes, ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" presented the clearest signs of what would become his trademark: un-flinching attitude, set-pieces driven by oppressive ambiances, gruesome giallo cliches and stomach-churning violence. Interestingly, for such a groundbreaking horror movie, “Don't Torture a Duckling” kept audiences on the edge of their seats thanks to carefully created scenarios involving closely relatable, not entirely heroic figures as protagonists."|0
"Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce  television shows

This has made TV production more competitive in the current landscape and creators are driven to ensure the quality of their content matches what’s already out there. But increased production capabilities doesn’t just open up the opportunities for entertainment, it opens up new worlds of information for the public. These new productions include informational, factual and in-depth TV content that increases understanding and awareness of news and current affairs. Audiences have become a global participant in news and informational outlets making their opinion heard worldwide."|0
Gary Busey's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography. Since had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see that fine actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well.An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Thankfully, Mr. Busey was Oscar-nominated for this, losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A fairly low-budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with GREAT SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope this made plenty of dough.|1
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar ! The film took a while to pick up from the  critics due to the perception that it might turn out to be a spiritual propaganda. But fans everywhere saw the true wonder and beauty of the movie, due to the excellence in directing and strong script by Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe and Bobby Farrelly. The sets, art and special effects, supported by Jim Carrey's brilliant acting, helped it soar and sent the production on its way to an over 95% score in Rotten Tomatoes.|0
I thought this was movie was great, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with Richard Greico's character. They end up getting married and everything seems perfect except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, however she has a hard time trying to conceive. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy, and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the acting was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing.|1
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an ""against the system"" type of movie and attitude. It is an excellent portrayal of the ""system"" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. The funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That is what college should be about..I come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines."|1
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love of Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life. Jang Seung-up is one of the (maybe the most) famous Korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. Given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature, it is amazing that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill.|1
This is my favourite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! Peter Falk is on form as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favourite episode). The supporting cast are great especially Julie Newmar (very under-rated) and Jeanette Nolan as the house keeper that Columbo just keeps on upsetting.|1
"This is a brilliant film . The story starts off in Romania , where Billy Crystal stars as an agent  investigating the paranormal

Billy Crystal soon realizes his troubles have only begun as he travels all over Romania, encountering eerie abandoned villages and horrific spectres. In addition, he meets an obscure professor and her colleagues to uncover a dastardly plot by supernatural forces. Soon they come to an evil lair, in which they have to battle against a horrifically powerful being. A major battle follows, full of mysterious events and actions-packed sequences."|0
"The revelation here is Lana Turner 's dancing ability . Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub  dancer and described by peers as a ""fanatical dancer,"" it wasn't until

She made the full-length Technicolor musical _Brigadoon_ that the world truly saw her physical potential as a dancer. Moviegoers marveled at her impressive interpretive skills as she confidently tackled her character's significant ballet, tap and traditional showgirl production numbers. Furthermore, it showcased Turner's immense grace, sense of rhythm and innate femininity in unique, highly pleasing ways. Her vitality onscreen was more powerful than anyone could have imagined."|0
"The ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" scene was a riot. I also guffawed at the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the Japanese guy and said ""Pearl Harbor buddy"". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure because I can't count that high.Funny thing, this 10 line requirement. Seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long, not too short. I hope I don't make it to 1,000 words before I get to line 10.I'm still two lines short."|1
"The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something akin to the first ""Starwars"" movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is wonderful."|1
"Coming from the ""druggie"" generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it I can't remember but a few things."|1
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap, for one thing!|1
Jeff Garlin 's film is filled with heart and laughter . As in Curb Your Enthusiasm , his screen persona  combines insouciance, gentility and meandering . In 'Handsome: A Netflix Mystery Movie', Jeff Garlin dons his Director’s hat as well. He plays Gene Handsome, a solitary LA police detective in search of a murderer and with not many leads. We observe how he tentatively steps up in dealing with his fellow partners, investigate his colorful family, work hard in giving each clue their attention and roll in clever gags like tackling dead suspect role play.|0
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative , but I loved this movie . I  laughed , I cried , and it felt like I was truly taken away on a cinematic adventure. I was intrigued by the actors' performances and the writing was some of the best I've seen in recent years . The characters' development, symbolism , and themes really caught my eye and stuck with me after I had seen the film . The cinematography of the film was stunning, from the wonderful slow motion shots during the party to the suspenseful long tracking shot of the rooftop chase .|0
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh: as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute TV commercial about dandruff! See: the 50 foot Victor Mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film! Hear: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell Davey Jones ""Your music is awfully white""! Experience: the Monkees' only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: as Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father!"|1
My husband and I watched this last night ... It was wonderful .... For once he was wrong in guessing  the story's plot. We were left on the edge of our seats and cheered as the characters made it through the surprising conclusion. This was by far one of the best movie-viewing experiences my husband and I have shared. When the movie credits finished rolling, he jokingly said that we shouldn't pick such mysterious movie the next time. Although it felt almost unfair to be completely blindsided like that, I think that surprise element gave us an entertaining story.|0
"I 've got to say it . Gary Busey saved this film . If it were not for his fine  performance 

the whole story line of the film would have been stale and dull . His charm and wit make this story unique . He played an eccentric character who did things in his own off beat ways ,making him so endearing to the audience. Everyone knows he isn't always the best actor ,but you couldn't help but fall in love with him as he almost gave the movie new life. He stood out with a superb performance that truly added something to the film that was beyond exceptional."|0
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from ""Ed"" and the new Apple computer ads."|1
"I do n't see that much wrong with this movie . Granted , the principal singers might not be Luciano  Pavarotti 

The plot is still very strong, and despite their lesser known status, the vocal talent provides their best. Of course, if there had been Pavarotti singing in this movie it would have been mesmerizing, yet its characters make it admirable nonetheless. Although many might scoff at the lesser known artist singing, these talented voices enhance the action of this captivating film. What matters the most is that it can touch our emotions and bring about pleasure, this is a well deserving outcome for those less talented musicians."|0
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I made my homework.Still, the show caught my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.But the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.The lead actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance.|1
"As many of today 's movies are guilty of , the plot is n't exactly stellar , the movie does  not draw much on innovation 

That being said, it is still engaging and intriguing enough to hold the viewers’ interest. There is just the right amount of tension and moments of surprise that break up the repetitious moments throughout the film. While some scenes seem familiar, they remain fresh due to the different characters they involve. There are plenty of humorous parts sprinkled throughout the film as well, a reminder of the strong acting abilities that each of the players is capable of."|0
`` Blind Spot '' one of my festival favorites . I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers  uniting together in an unconventional setting. The atmosphere at the theatre that day was intense with anticipation and intrigue. Despite being three complete strangers, we connected with a shared desire to take a leap of faith. As the movie unfolded, I was captivated and utterly astounded by the intertwined and utterly mesmerizing storytelling. At the end of the movie, we silently watched our stories cross paths, talking back to what we'd just seen and letting out our minds with sheer wonder.|0
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a  strong horror aesthetic has cemented Fulci's place as a horror icon. Despite his fame as a horror filmmaker, Fulci was involved in all sorts of genres in his later career, including romantic comedy and supernatural Westerns. What was constant throughout was a stylish aesthetic and some of Fulci's famous shots in horror still serve as sources of inspiration today. The Italian horror filmmaker had an eye for detail which led to a technical filmmaking sophistication never seen before in that genre.|0
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years . On the contrary , I  still enjoyed the story and all its classic comedy. To my delight, the lead actor in the film still looked the same, playing his role in his characteristic style. While the make-up, hairstyles and special effects have improved vastly since the time of its original release, the sentimental humour is still wonderfully familiar and uplifting. And with some great visual cues in between to enjoy, it was certainly as I remembered. The engaging themes make this classic timeless, reminding us of days long gone by but oh so loved.|0
I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally).|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good. I have to admit Ms Cruz can really act. She puts on a very good performance. In fact she our does her boyfriend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself. I bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an Italian. However, I did learn something. One more chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany the many Italian soliders killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and Germany's eventual surrender.|1
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction.|1
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form . I tracked it down  years later but wasn't satisfied. It took many more years of scouring online shops and tracklisting of the directors works before I could locate an uncut version of this particular movie. As soon as I had access to the entire film, I marvelled at its wondrous plot, evoking visuals and emotive soundtrack. There was a way in which the editing and plot subtly carried me from one plot point to another and thus improved the film’s overall narrative arc.|0
James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I don't think this true. Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words.|1
"As far as I know I 've seen most of Lucio Fulci 's films , with the exception of some  minor pieces

Though many people say his works were bloody and unsettling, they usually taught the important lesson in life and often the conclusion implied people need to find their way by themselves, facing each challenge with full strength. Despite the few questionable ideas he often presented in his movies, you must recognize it for its charm and typicalness for Fulci style. Not just about gore and gratuity, his films also invited us to explore, imagine and broaden the imagination about endless topics and many untouchable issues for most of the time."|0
What an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. Why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing.|1
Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for Billy Crystal. This movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid.|1
I can not say this movie was a hilarious , but I must have had a grin on my face  throughout the entire experience. The director truly succeeded in entertaining viewers from all types of genres. It featured something for everyone - horror, drama, suspense, humor, and thrilling elements to make for an engaging two hours. What was perhaps the most unique about it was its intense unpredictability. As someone who detests spoilers, I enjoyed the suspense, constantly sitting on the edge of my seat until the shocking and fascinating climax.|0
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once , about ten years ago . It's hard to believe, but my memory is still relatively fresh on the book, given it has been 10 years since I've read it. It was an adventure through the world of one very exciting Captain and the insane but accurate journey he takes on board his boat. I vividly remember watching in awe and being so immersed in his many exploits. Watching the movie made me feel like I was transported back to my bedroom ten years ago, revisiting my childhood as the wildest story was unfolding.|0
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an `` against the system '' type of movie and  encourage any illegal or misconduct to adults or against other age groups,

Contrary to what many may believe, this movie isn't an ``against the system'' type of movie, but actually highlights the power of believing in yourself and encouraging teenagers to embrace adulthood without offending their elders or wrongfully criticizing others. Despite living under authority of the adults around them, teens should practice humility, responsible and being able to raise their voices up in cases where adults go too far."|0
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO , regardless of the age of the OAV . The plot  was well structured and really fleshed out but was it enough? I'd have to say no, unfortunately. To this day, the old school look of the animation hasn't aged well compared to the remakes, sequels, or other modern adaptations of this story. If this OAV had had improved animation or updated CGI to help visualize the scene and immerse the viewer, then I'm certain I would've felt much differently.|0
"This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie . It follows all the  storytelling fundamentals that make films engaging, while staying relevant to modern times

The film features great performances, direction and stunning visuals that don't fail to transport viewers to the onscreen action. Music also plays a large part in providing the atmosphere for each scene, ranging from emotionally charged ballads to highly percussive techno-style beats. These together enhance the mood and drive the narrative even further. While the movie provides meaningful food for thought, there is no denying it also offers some highly entertaining and adrenaline-fueled moments."|0
This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film ( which is excellent ) . It borrows  the basic idea of an innocent innocent accidently switched at birth , but uses it to focus more on family ties , prejudice , and equality of opportunity. The 21st century remake paints a better and more relatable portrait of poverty and power struggles while tackling meaningful and pertinent issues that are all too prevalent today. Racism and a man’s failure to create meaningful changes for the betterment of his loved ones, both story-wise and visual, are high up the agenda in this remake of a classic 1949 O'Brien story.|0
It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's careers. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not Robert's. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def.Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat.|1
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800hrs) and I still watch it! I don't like the A-Team... I absolutely adore them!! It is just great to see Justin chasing the former members of A-Team. Brings back memories from the old days, when I was young an sweet. I would have given you a 10 for excellent, but Justin looks like he is chasing the former A-Team members all by himself. Of course, that is the only bad thing on this documentary.|1
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. But it has a lot more. Thanks, Bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale.|1
"I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt , My parents loved  this show as much as me

It was one of the best shows on TV and even today I can't forget some of the funny moments it presented. There was always some fresh humor every week with creative characters who loved having adventures together. It had heart-felt comedy, family dynamics and fun anecdotes which will forever make it memorable. Now I catch re-runs sometimes, which really sparks nostalgia and helps me relive childhood memories."|0
Made at the height of the Black Power movement , this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope ( Arnold Johnson )   as a surprisingly articulate African American advertising executive , as he embarks upon a campaign against media stereotypes by creating television commercials that feature healthy , well adjusted African-Americans going about their daily lives. When Johnson changes the demographics of the ad firm, racial prejudice rears its ugly head, but Johnson triumphs over the social expectations in the ad game to emphasize individuality and acceptance. Moreover, through a wealth of delightful deadpan comedy and unusually bold polemical messages, this movie advocated for socio-economic fairness during the most politicized of periods in American cinema.|0
To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. Folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. So, here's what I think:The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, however). Some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. Altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple.|1
"This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not : intelligence and good messages . Accepted ,  the characters appear 2 dimensional but the wonderful directing techniques helped boost the tension to an exceedingly high level 

The sound-tracks and setting felt very suitable in showing us exactly how one character was feeling. Additionally, what helped to captivate my attention even more was the diversity amongst the main cast. With regards to emotions, no one scene ever felt boring or overdramatized; instead the fear, confusion, joy and ultimately the desire of winning was simply convincing in a very convincing manner."|0
"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a "" Conchie "" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes ."|1
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and was such a delightful movie. It was shot beautifully around India and I want to go there now. The main actor..Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie..Monsoon Wedding. He was the total star of the show. Benoit's character cracked me up...was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great too. They were all great!|1
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS...Hmm.... Only that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled!! You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. Everyone playing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly!|1
"I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci 's reputation as a director . Too often he 's  misunderstood

As a horror fanatic, I believe that Lucio Fulci's movies represent an era that very few other directors dare touch. Sadly, they are often misunderstood by modern critics as mediocre. While his gory visuals definitely evoke uneasiness in many viewers, the underlying themes behind his works often deliver unexpected statements about current society. I am most perturbed, however, by the fact that so few nowadays have any knowledge of this exceptional director and the impact his movies have had in modern horror cinema."|0
"I thought that the storyline came into place very well . I liked this movie a lot . If you  haven’t seen it, you should definitely take a chance

The characters were strong and authentic, showing an underlying chemistry between them, making their dialogues more captivating and comical. The music throughout the film helped to maintain a good and calm atmosphere, contributing greatly to how enjoyable the overall film experience was. On top of this, the visuals were interesting, contrasting tones with humorous movements to entertain the viewer even more."|0
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I 've seen in a while . It 's an emotional roller-coaster  from beginning to end. The main protagonist's emotional growth and the pain his family endures tugs at the heart strings throughout the movie. In this heartbreaking story, there are characters that feel like your own. The acting by each one is sheer brilliance and brought some much needed laughter, moments of courage and at times sorrow. The hardships one family faces to express unconditional love as its power does miracles is as inspiring as it is devastating.|0
"These days , you rarely come by a kid 's show that does not involve 1 ) a preteen/teen pop  star ,2 ) CGI animation or 3 ) crude humor 

Even adults in recent times opt for cartoon shows that go for basic entertainment which revolve around relatable life struggles, low drama humour and seldom indulge in mischievousness. Increasingly, adults look forward to an escape that involves informative knowledge packed inside enjoyable fun. Aspiring adults like to view works of intellectual labor by relevant organizations such as online college education entities and freelance organizations alike."|0
I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden.|1
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog 's filmic work that is without  a doubt both powerful and effective. It documents the incredible journey of a man born in rural Germany. Despite the death and despair which serves as the backdrop of Little Dieter's struggles, the documentary carries an innate hope as it shares a grippingly brave story of love and of determination, as Dieter recounts his daring attempts to survive a devastating war. This is all intensified by vivid footage from war and archival materials.|0
This movie felt so real . I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various  times. The truth behind the performances of all the characters made the whole movie so captivating. Every single minute was filled with raw emotion that everyone watching could relate to. The actors seemed to reach right into my heart and grasp all of my childhood fears and doubts, the bittersweetness of unrequited love, the desperate struggle of understanding the intentions of a significant other. In an effort to forget their pains and reach that level of contentment they all looked towards their future.|0
"it 's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar  fight

The fight escalates with each of them determined to prove themselves. Suddenly the local police are called, each person was escorted away in different police vehicles. When it was all said and done, not one of them would talk to the other. This bar fight could've been easily avoided if they had managed their time more wisely instead of being impulsive and acted out of pride. It shows how easy it can be to lose control over even the most basic judgement calls when the ego and peer pressure gets involved."|0
"First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one! I watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say ""This sucks people cant fly!"" to them i say IT'S FICTION and that it is. This is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a ""fairytale"". And a very pleasant to watch Asian fairytale. The image's can actually blow your mind. Because there so artistically filmed , Ang Lee has a very (unapreciated u might say) big talent."|1
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people would n't like it . While I did enjoy this movie, I understand that it may not be everyone's cup of tea. For those of us who appreciated the dreamlike aesthetics and surreal narrative of the story, this film provided us with something truly unique. On the other hand, viewers who are accustomed to mainstream blockbusters or romantic comedies will most likely have trouble grasping the unconventional direction this film has taken. As with most things in life, there is always a disagreement and some will undoubtedly find something to hate.|0
`` D.O.A '' is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish . Dennis Quaid is at his  magnetic best playing Joey Adams. Keegan is amazingly solid in her delivery as Alexandra Barnes and help make the lead-role stars explode on the screen. Stanley Tucci's enterprising Police Officer Evans does an incredible job as does J.T. Walsh as dead police detective Bishop. The original music for the film by Trevor Rabin increases the screen tension and really fits the style of this siren calling film, reminding us to understand what's important and not taken for granted.|0

I've been a fan of Rachael's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I have seen her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen, because I saw how taken Oprah is with her, and with good reason: she comes across as very natural, and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. The set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on).|1
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it again one more time before I... well.. you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) ""captures"" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end?"|1
"Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie . I am not saying this lightly . I  am passionate about films, so for me to really love a movie, it must be truly something special

To me, the movie really exceeded my expectations. The breathtaking visuals and special effects captured my heart from the very start. The story was amazingly interesting, and the music added to the effect, even taking the experience to a whole new level. In addition to all that, the chemistry between the characters felt sincere, which helped to make it that much more enjoyable."|0
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I , which gave us Werner Herzog 's `` Lessons of Darkness  , '' a documentary that somberly reflected upon

Before Gulf War I, even without an actual conflict in his background, Herzog was able to make ‘’Lessons of Darkness’’ work because it presented war as a horror show - an exhibition that provoked an array of morbidly philosophical questions to viewers: what have we become in these times? And more hauntingly, have we turned blind eye to atrocity simply because the global concept of 'death' today seems much smaller and wider at once?"|0
I will admit, I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, I felt like many did. I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead I was given... well, I didn't know what I was given to be honest.However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.|1
it's a great movie for the whole family. i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure. i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy from her.|1
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt but became separated from his unit. After nearly starving and/or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy. It brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal. All things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter.|1
"David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life , this time the creatures under the sea , in this extraordinary  documentary series

David Attenborough dives deep into the ocean to reveal the intriguing world of sea life, from the best kept secrets hidden in coral reefs and the majestic migrating fish, to the crevices of the deep sea floor where alien creatures like the giant spider crabs roam. He examines the way in which life forms inhabit this world and form essential links within complex ocean eco systems. He reveals how even the tiniest plankton help sustain every major habitat on earth."|0
I really enjoyed this film, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobbys and show them as people with emotions. As this film needed to show Bobby as a cold and vindictive person.I agree with another review it was sick love, not true love. He didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together.|1
This is one of my favourite Disney films. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way.|1
SPOILERS BELOW ` A Dog 's Life ' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing . In Charlie Chaplin 's signature role of a man 's best friend, he provided great laughs. In this short, the homeless and desperate street dog finds unlikely alliances, competes in a flea circus , encounters sorrow , and eventually makes a beautiful last sacrifice. Through it all , Chaplin demonstrated both his exceptional comic ability as well as deep poignancy. In the end , Charlie won our hearts with an unexpectedly powerful lesson about true love and heroism . The stunning film reveals a stunning exploration into human spirit.|0
This is one of my favorite films, ever. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. This is funny, creative, and always on target. This movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story.|1
Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat ! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the  star-studded cast of Beloved, it was no surprise when it was declared one of the best movies of 1999. Directed by Neil Jones and produced by Cary Breidster, Beloved went on to scoop up a number of awards. From it's initial Festival screenings to award acceptance speeches, the entire process felt like one gigantic movie celebration. It's beautiful tale of redemption, coupled with powerful performances from an esteemed cast, further contributed to this movie's iconic status in popular culture.|0
"I 've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was  the lead actor

I have watched the film out of curiosity, hoping to find something new that would entertain me. But unfortunately, to my surprise it was totally off from my expectation. Seeing a huge brand ambassador in Paris Hilton was quite new and overwhelming but nothing quite surpassed the sudden thoughts that encircled my mind about the casting. On contrary to its fame, many also didn't find it as exciting as it seems on first glance and criticized its aplomb plot."|0
"In the first transformation scene , what is the music ? I 've heard it was `` The Greeks Do  Not Understand Music ``

The Greek music used in the first transformation scene of the movie was written by Yanni and is part of his famous instrumental album Dare to Dream. Composed with classical instruments like sitar, percussion, keyboard and winds, this melodious tune will resonate in the listener's mind. Not just catchy and melodious, it is a genre defining piece which demonstrates the artists experience, and their experimentation with old styles of playing which feel contemporary at the same time."|0
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer, one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be ""forgotten"" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan ""that's hot"" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???"|1
This is probably my favourite TV show ever . I love all the characters , especially Alex , who is  the star of the show. Alex is not your typical hero. Despite his imposing figure, he shows compassion and understanding, always going the extra mile for his friends. He often displays loyalty and bravery beyond his limits and works extremely hard to keep things on the right path. Through it all, Alex maintains his calm composure, enabling him to face off the many adversities and obstacles. His strength, tenacity, and resolve to follow through on his dreams motivate all of the other characters, as well as viewers.|0
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but  it can be ignore for its exciting story. This sequel keeps viewers glued to the screen through intense action, as well as heart-stopping thrill and anticipation. Each part of the movie was spectacular, from start to finish. Every character is a treat to watch as their life story builds the movie forward. Cinematography and art were breathtaking, giving the movie its trademark impact. Music was brilliant and added suspense to the story and heightened the sense of thriller and mystery.|0
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen! The images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning. On top of that, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end. You'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching TV! This series is available to buy on DVD and I HIGHLY recommend picking this one up!|1
"""Blind Spot"" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love."|1
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen . Clearly not that many because it only  had a 66% score from Rotten Tomatoes. However, the good reviews make up for that with movie critics hailing its amazing soundtrack and characterization. It has a place in classic animation with one reviewer claiming it as Disney’s underrated animation genius. The bright visuals and a lively ensemble create something close to magical. One particularly notable moment involves the scene between Madame, Duchess and the pupettes with O’Malley also playing a big part in it.|0
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good. And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. The other two principals were ""decent"". But the characters themselves...what on earth was so bad about the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him behaving like the martinet Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an insufferable jerk who I was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise. Who was I kidding? Tom Wilkinson isn't Paul Bettany after all."|1
"I will admit , I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film , and after about 5  minutes I had to stop

I realized this movie was nothing like I had anticipated. I found myself in absolute terror and could not watch it any longer. Instead of being adventurous and fun, this movie seemed more suspenseful, sinister, and unpredictable. To top it all off, I was incredibly bored and was beginning to get headaches and strain from having to concentrate to keep track of the constant, unexplainable plot twists. This experience just confirmed why I much prefer the positive type of adventures over this kind."|0
I loved this film!! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw it opening night and loved it, Some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made.|1
I never heard of architect , Louis Kahn , until this documentary . In this almost two hour documentary which  interviews renowned and recent graduates of Kahn’s architectural ideologies such as Tom Mayo, Aaron Betsky and Barbara Borgian. The film showcased interviews that outlined how the legacy of Kahn still resonates in the architectural works from renowned cities from the 70s like Yale Center of British Arts and Capital Complex in Bangladesh to remarkable works from 70's . The interviews between esteemed guests with uncanny recollection of amazing facts helps enrich the understanding of this talented and often underserved person.|0
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? This film does not answer the latter question either way, but it does appear that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. Like most new producers/directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb).|1
"This movie is truly a classic 80s movie ! A must have in any '80s ' movie collection ! Guns  , big shoulder pads , shoulder 

high hair and shoulder padding set the trend . You know the Eighties had arrived with this iconic film. Synthesizers featuring in the score add the needed twist , invoking flashbacks to other epic blockbuster successes. Some scenes are incredible and get the adrenaline rushing as others featuring budding teen romance for 80's entertainment. Along with any appropriate side kicks -the cross over teenage loves rivals are all too familiar , plus everyone having funny looks to mix it up as needed ."|0
Based on a William Faulkner short story, Two Soldiers is a top notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. The story involves two dirt poor Mississippi brothers, one only a kid, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer Jonathan Furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go, and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the Army himself.|1
This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition.|1
* Could contain spoilers , read only after seeing last episode season 2 * Think about it . The guys  of Gravity Fall faced some hard realities in that Season 2 finale and have worked to confront those with newfound resolve . In the face of coming back to school and everything they had faced over the course of their time in Gravity Falls, the group put in effort and finally united in the common goal of discovering the truths and understanding the significance of those. Their connection deepened through such experiences and mutual bonds were formed. Dipper and Mabel now realize the power of such a brotherly and sisterly relationship when facing such predicaments.|0
"This new installment to the Child's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing Chucky giveing him the finger and saying ""rude f--king doll"" and lots of references to the series: ""you can kill me but I'll come back. I always come back"". The movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all other films in the series. It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones."|1
"So it's not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? ""The Villain"" and this one could top the list.My husband says that ""Jekyll and Hyde Together Again"" is one of those movies that if ""you've been there and done that"" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes.... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate."|1
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics.|1
"Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I 've just managed to watch this film for the second  time 

This time the experience of watching this film was just mesmerising, my curiosity which took me here all the way hasn't left yet and its even increased now, also this film pushed my understanding level higher and gives my imaginative brain lot more stuff to ponder over. The credit goes to that helpful member and to the filmmakers. Since its a classic drama-noir crime so certain morals have to be thrown upon the viewers at certain level and It took full responsibility to do its job without fail."|0
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though I find Nirvana overrated). It sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. Jansen puts in little touches like the books (Kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. And you can really feel that in this.|1
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat -- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had  seen this movie a few years ago and convinced me it was worth our time and money. He wasn't wrong - it kept us laughing all night. We admired how cleverly it highlighted issues that have long been swept under the rug. For example, while clearly highlighting sexual harassment at the office, it did so without sensationalizing the topics and even presented multiple sides. Moreover, its use of everyday occurrences demonstrated its relatability to audiences everywhere. It's clear why the film is so loved!|0
The cover of the VHS says it all : `` Without doubt , the most powerful movie of its kind . '' What it doesn't show, however, is that beyond being an exhilarating roller coaster ride, the movie comes to hold a greater purpose and conveys a hidden meaning that left its audience ruminating and eager for more. Taking movie fans down the path of learning and cultural exposure with just one single viewing experience, it immediately turns it into a transformational journey. Despite its radical perspectives, it stayed faithful to its audience by rendering the exceptional powerful in a dignified and understanding light.|0
This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. I've been seeing Justin Long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, I figured with the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials not withstanding.) This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message.|1
"This little film is hysterical , full of stereotypes about gays , straights , dwarfs , British tea and pubs  

It mocks anything and everything which crosses its way . The underlying message , despite all the fun and frivolity is that, true to human nature , regardless of background, everyone has the potential to share experiences , love and learn from each other . By getting past preconceived notions of who one is and with openmindedness to be around everyone , everyone will realise what wonderful people other are. In other words, don’t judge a book by its cover."|0
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail.|1
I saw this movie on PBS the first time. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch it, I can get something else out of it. It's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like Charlotte don't want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is outstanding with all-stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy.|1
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years, and I can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick. I can't believe that Channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. It focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other.|1
Not a stunner , but a good movie to see once or twice . Bill Macy shows he can do  comedy well as he tries to rid his home of demons . The movie also focuses on marital communication and loving relationships. Bill Macy struggles to understand his wife, who seems very preoccupied with trying to ward off her demonic entities. He learns a few things about why the messages and activity his family's household had been experiencing, and their collective values. Bill Macy realizes how important it is to always seek clarity from one another, and that listening and accepting differences makes marriage strong and more secure.|0
What an excellent movie , made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it  without researching or reading a review. We both absolutely loved it, especially the cliff-hanger at the end. The story line had so many plot twists and exciting moments, so many unexpected surprises that made the movie an edge-of-your-seat type of entertainment. I hadn't seen something like that since my wife and I watched a murder-mystery a few weeks ago. Although the ending of this film did not require much speculation on who had committed the crime, it definitely captivated us right to the very last minute.|0
These days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. About 95% of shows on Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network fit the listed criteria. To put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. It as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail.|1
Really, This movie should be released to DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio film and I was utterly pleased!!! It was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo & Juliet, and also John Gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone I thought that for the small amount I was spending it would be fine. Boy was I right.|1
The writers of lost have outdone themselves . Season two 's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the  season one. The buildup of this finale was such an edge of your seat experience. We were filled with equal parts despair, anticipation and joy as all of our questions from season one seemed to be answered. Every second had us sitting on the edge of our seats as we started to unravel the complexities of this series and all the untold secrets we were in for. The climatic ending left us bereft in mourning and with our questions answered, the viewers hung up their speculating caps.|0
"Without going into any details of a good...if a somewhat provocative...TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is ""no one to blame here"".I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes may be young and horny (and good looking) because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom, that doesn't mean, he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I don't buy it."|1
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid. It shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation. Jan Ellis was taught that a black man was a plague. He was raised to be that way. Then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs, Pastor Lekota. will he change his ways?. The film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another, it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy.|1
"As I have said before , I am NOT a fan of Tweety . He 's just so aggravating I 

find myself needing a long breather after listening to his twittery-ness. Whenever he talks to me, it feels like an eternity of droning! As I’ve already shared, I haven't seen an episode of Tweety yet and am definitely not going to be making an effort anytime soon. From all of the snippets and snippets I have seen, he seems very out of control, hyperactive and almost border-line on aggressive. He sure has the other characters all stressed out and up the wall."|0
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut).|1
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments  and up close wildlife encounters. The scientists’ narratives serve as powerful narrators, illuminating and commenting upon their discovery, expanding our understanding of the living world while connecting to current global challenges and conveying deeper universal life lessons. In every episode viewers are captivated with mesmerizing original images of species, of captivating sea behavior, of interplay of life and environmental changes, as well as brought close to inspiring figures and communities doing work towards restoring ocean biodiversity.|0
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans. Okay I'm sure it's not as good as what the Child's Play movie were like, but this can get really funny and enjoyable, Chucky's laughs are hilarious. (SPOILERS)Now not one doll, but two, meaning double the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.If you have seen the Child's Play movies this would be a worthy film on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the Child's play movies before, this'll will be a new start.|1
I did n't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD . I knew it had a cult  following but I hadn't watched any of its work. Once I pressed play, I was amazed! I had never experienced anything like this before; I was entranced. The sweeping shots and innovative editing wowed me. Not to mention, the beautiful yet dark storyline! Every scene managed to take me away, with unpredictable twists and suspense. I enjoyed it thoroughly and my views on movie-watching had drastically changed from then. It's become my go-to entertainment pick anytime I have an itch for something different.|0
There's no point in comparing this with the original series. Though different in look and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, an SF/horror anthology series. Due to indifferent scheduling in Australia, I've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The very first episode really did give me the creeps (nightmares at my age ...!) but a number of others did fall flat; generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from SF. I only hope the DVDs reach us eventually.|1
"Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie . But really all the characters are amazingly fun to  watch

All the characters bring something different to the movie. from Ray as the serial killing dad to Joshua as the badass, socially conscious nephew. Diora Baird is delightfully zany as Sam. She brings life to each scene. She gives viewers some fun, spunky performance to keep you entertained throughout the movie. And speaking of entertainment, Sam also stars in some classic Halloween tunes which will no doubt bring you back to good ol' days of classic rock and monster movies."|0
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to  clever quotations later

The writing was fast-paced and humorous with surprising twists that have stayed with the audience even after seeing it multiple times. This movie captures some special place in people's hearts, especially the loyal fanbase that make regular outings to see it and stand by its importance within the context of film history. The brilliant comic timing, outstanding direction, and many references to works of literature, as well as familiar characters from filmography, keeps one entertained to the last frame."|0
I 'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it 's absolutely everything you could  possibly want in a movie. This movie keeps you guessing the entire time and always with great tension that mounts throughout the entire film.The characters are fully developed, with great storytelling elements and direction. There are unexpected plot twists, especially with how it all comes together in the end. You will laugh, cry, and hold your breath! The emotional roller coaster throughout the entire film is definitely something special, that leaves the viewer emotionally engaged throughout.|0
What a great film! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. The music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change a thing in this film, it was all good!|1
`` Back in the Day '' is an interesting , but flawed effort . Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper  , a streetwise former-criminal , and Heather Locklear is great as Denise Sullivan , Reggie’s first and last true love. However, the flaws appear right in the first scene as Reggie not only continually changes clothes but even though its summer time, his clothes keep changing in their seasonal garments which breaks up any kind of film continuity. The rest of the plot may appear too coincidental for some viewers but at the same time there are surprising plot revelations.|0
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, Tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. Tiffany and Chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk! !Don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. It is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!My rating : 9/10.|1
My husband and I watched this last night...It was wonderful....For once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending. It moved along very quickly and the acting was superb.. I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway. He has never made a bad movie as far as I'm concerned. The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is awesome. We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience.|1
I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast ! Everyone was laughing hysterically and the atmosphere was lively. We cheered whenever there were thrilling scenes, we talked about which characters we identified with, and as soon as the movie finished, we were already talking about how excited we were for its wide release. My friends and I exchanged theories about the plot, speculating on how it was going to unfold in the sequels. As we exited the cinema we couldn’t help but be excited for the opportunity to watch the movie again.|0
"When `` Madame '' decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble . The snobbish Butler Edgar who  manages her home along with her enormous estate for years knows he should take control of her 

He speaks to Madame's closest relatives and the staff at her estate hoping to convince them of what is best. Madame remains firm, however, believing her decision was the right one. He begrudgingly submits to Madame's request but a feeling of dread fills him with unease. What if the cats act upon their baser instincts, put them and their trust at risk?"|0
Oh my gosh!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so incredible......I loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult. It is my favorite Disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I watch it a ton.....It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart.|1
"I think that this short TV series , was absolutely wonderful , and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation  of what it truly means to practice forgiveness

It gave an authentic illustration of how people could heal from deep and heart wrenching pain by showing simple but tangible steps towards compassion and reconciliation. Seeing characters on the brink of closure but find peace as well as offering solutions for tackling pent up anger, hurt and pain provided meaningful catharsis. I strongly suggest watching this series to all who’ve ever found it difficult to extend forgiveness and expect similar miracles to help make healing process smoother."|0
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO type channels. I missed the beginning but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you get the chance take the time to watch it. Every once in a while I think about having the cable company take off my Movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them.|1
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. I've been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I didn't care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but I find life is that way. It didn't bother me.|1
'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. It is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. Yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! Nicolas Cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon.|1
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be . Terrible acting ! Implausible scenerios ! Ridiculous death  scenes ! Lackluster story-telling, occasional monotone line deliveries, horrid fashion decisions, eye-rolling one-liners, blatantly unrealistic locations and dimly-lit cinematography...Death Wish 3 delivers all these no matter which way you look at it. On top of this it also touts cringe-worthy fight scenes, overflowing over-acting and more sudden impossibilities than can be seen in any 10 average slasher flicks combined. It's hilarious, ungraceful, exciting and perfectly awful all at once! A sure fire classic for lovers of intentionally-bad film!|0
"I first saw ""Signs of Life"" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.The direction is subtle and effective. I've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it."|1
"Just as in ""Columbo"" we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike ""Columbo"". It is William H. Macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. Constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his ""perfect crime"". William H. Macy fans will enjoy ""A Slight Case Of Murder"", as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities."|1
"What a surprise . A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor ' only naughtier . Funny guy  Joey Nihilist becomes 

Professor Nihilist. An entertaining hybrid of past favorites, set to rival any college fave. With a wild and enthusiastic twist on an old favorite, Professor Nihilist has both parents and young kids rolling with laughter. Full of great life lessons and at the same time witty and modern dialog, the audience of all ages will appreciate the strong messages conveyed. Creative genius casts and masterful script adds amazing accuracy in caricature. Despite its pratfalls Professor Nihilist could also go on to inspire one-liner magicians of tomorrow."|0
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME . With a all star cast that includes Peter Finch, Sally Field, and Liv Ullman as the core trio with additional scene stealers by Olivia Hussey, George Kennedy and Michael York, this musical adaptation takes us on a visual and musically delightful journey with positive moral message that stands to the test of time. Even when the wacky outfits of yesteryear reminds of the temporal limitations, it never hurts the spirit and upbeat tempo of the feature.|0
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the ""tramp"" and Dutchess is the ""lady,"" but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.Phil Harris is our tomcat O'Malley."|1
"`` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is one of the coolest Italian horror films I 've ever seen , 

It's a unique thriller that successfully merges horror and suspense with subtle wit and horror humour. What makes the film such an iconic piece of horror art is its sophisticated storyline, dynamic characters, unique soundtrack, and artful visuals. Set in Southern Italy during a backdrop of superstition and taboo, this crime story about a brutal serial murderer doesn't flinch in terms of dealing with dark topics such as justice and revenge, albeit with great empathy towards those whose livelihoods have been destroyed."|0
That this film flopped at the box office, and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - yet somehow rather appropriate. The commercial suicide the Monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on-screen. To destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome American alternative to the Beatles is courageous to the point of rashness, as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality.|1
"i love this film ! ! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is  saying 

I also found it funny how he brought together all kinds of people, backgrounds, and opinions, despite their differences. Every single one of the characters felt like a real human being and the conversations were very thought-provoking. Watching the film made me understand my generation and the struggles they are facing better than before. All in all, the movie felt timeless to me and the messages he put across felt universal regardless of age, nationality or background."|0
"I loved this film , which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival . In March 2005 I  had seen a TV version

In March 2005 I had seen a TV version of this film, but I found the screen-width way of viewing makes it look much better. This thoughtfully made drama tells a sad story of loss and solitude. A remarkable actor turns in an extremely accurate portrayal of a common yet fragile emotion - despair. The gradual spiral downward of a couple broken apart by tragedies captured this audience. Some were so profoundly moved, tears were visible throughout."|0
"I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery 's best performances in a movie , and I have seen  quite a few of her movies

This movie will remain a favorite for me forever. Elizabeth Montgomery gives a powerful performance in the lead role as Katee Phillips , who tries desperately to break free from her alcohol addiction. Her painful and honest portrayal truly depicts her hardships and emotions. In her drunken state, Montgomery portrays Katee Phillips as a madman's wild swagger and malleability with fervor. All throughout the film she comes in with big unpredictable moments and tiny to display different emotion and commitment towards her roles."|0
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father, Louis Kahn, dead since 1974. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work.|1
* May Contain Spoilers * The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when  I was 13. At first, I couldn't take it seriously - it was like the kind of adventure films I loved, but with the focus on adults, not just kids. I hadn't heard the buzz about it that everyone was talking about. So, I figured I should give it a shot, and boy, was I glad I did! The story moved so quickly and the characters were all so lovable.|0
"I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer, and I'm so glad now that I have. It's truly a wonderful film. The actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. I love James McAvoy in this, and I can't wait to see him in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" movie this December. Romola Garai is wonderful too. Be sure to check her out in ""I Capture the Castle"" or ""Nicholas Nickleby,"" two of my favorite films."|1
Hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a bad-ass, funky film to watch some night, this is just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Any who.|1
Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage 's better films . He turns a fine performance as the  military officer trying to keep peace while managing to experience love and life while being in a seemingly never ending war. His interaction with the local folk of Greece shows off the charm of a love story set against the brutal landscape of WW2. In a balanced and subtle performance Cage leads us through this extraordinary story about one mans fortitude in the face of ultimate struggle. Many a bittersweet moment is granted the screen under the warmth of Cages allure.|0
Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii!|1
"For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something , and who appreciate a farce that is clever ly devised

The drama and farce provide ample distraction to brighten up even the most hard pressed days and elicit honest and thought provoking discourse. They teach us, enlighten us and entertain us in ways that textbooks never could. And even in those moments where something that was supposed to elicit laughter comes off wrong and misguided, a humorous look and the will to be more deliberate with future comedic ventures can win out over errors of intent."|0
"I ca n't get this flick off my brain . It 's definitely totally different than anything that 's out  now

It keeps lingering, poking, prodding at me from within my inner most depths. No amount of distraction can get my mind away from it. What exactly about it lingers in my conscience, its nearly hard to describe. It's something exciting, something special. Every single moment I have some vivid recollection or image that truly defines this unique piece of work. A delicate love affair, or a scalding emotional journey of adventure?"|0
"The Aristocats is really quite charming , and is rated far too low on IMDb . The songs are n't  enough

To recommend the movie. Although it is simple and heart-warming, the combination of Disney music, witty dialogue and endearing characters sets it apart from any ordinary kid's movie. Children find the colorful fur-characters immensely amusing, but the theme of loving one's family should make even a mature viewer take pause and be nostalgic. Though its rating may never rival Snow White's and Beauty's Beast's, this joyful jaunt around the French countryside earns an unmistakable special place in the Disney pantheon."|0
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. Fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.This film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Living Dead, House by the Cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of Italy.|1
This movie is beautiful in all ways. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience.|1
A great movie. The movie was even better then the commercials put on. And believe it or not it was very very inspirational. I really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.It was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up. I laughed. I laughed very hard on some parts. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being CLERKS II).|1
This is a stunning movie. Raw and sublimely moving. It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences. All of the main players are mesmerising. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. Julian Fellowes has triumphed again. He's a national treasure.|1
"Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films , it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment . The  feel of emptiness created is marvelous

It tackles deep moral quandries that questions viewers ' belief system of idealistic hope and grasps ones instinct for survial at times. Focused around its intangibility, this modern classic engages audiences on many levels which foster engagement in a no-previous-manual era. Adopting distinct color tints, lack of effects to profound subtle facial expressions – these three feature share striking homogeneity that straddles a ubiquitous arc of tension; rise, fall and revolutionized cadence of something further transcendental."|0
"I can not say this movie was a hilarious, but I must have had a grin on my face the entire time. I like this darker kind of comedy; ""very bad things"", ""8 heads in a duffel bag"" or ""coldblooded""The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. To me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be, but the way that ending came about was. Another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience."|1
I know this movie isn't for everyone, and I won't push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...It was the best I have ever seen!!! It was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't know what was gonna happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!|1
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman:TAS and its ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay, and Maurice LaMarche in various roles. The only qualm I had was Rob Paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending.|1
"When the Romulans come , they will not be bearing gifts ; no , they bring with them war -  machines and tales of bitter losses , dead colonies ,

The Romulans’ advance is menacing, as if an enormous shadow is ever growing closer to blot out the sun. It seems there is no respite from their presence; terror begins to permeate each space, following with the undertone of gathering oppression. Everyone remains worried - were these horrible rumours actually coming true? Then, much to our dismay, the reports of battle finally began coming through, harrowing tales of hardship and atrocities suffered."|0
This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies.For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself.|1
"* * 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert , Chad Michael Murray , Brian Van Holt , Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams . Paris Hilton is the poster-child of celebrity notoriety, with countless media headlines recounting her adventures in music, television, and fashion. Elisha Cuthbert stars as Kim Bauer on Fox's drama '24'. Chad Michael Murray continues to shine in movies and TV projects with memorable performances as a leading man in television’s most beloved shows. Brian Van Holt provides one of the series’ major themes in ""Sons of Anarchy"", where his portrayal as John “Jax” Teller evoked a man seeking a second chance."|0
So it 's not an award winner , so what ? Have you ever wanted to see a film that  felt like real life ? This movie may not win awards, but it certainly feels more real and relevant than any blockbuster out there. Not only will you experience the typical raw emotion, but it also conveys an unmatchable insight into society and culture that big budget films simply lack. It's all of these aspects and more that really makes it worth the watch. Moreover, you'd likely appreciate that there are rarely any sugar-coating moments and events taking place, just exactly what happened with or without bias.|0
I 've been a fan of Rachael 's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network , so I  was very excited when I learned she was coming out with a line of cookware. I had been eagerly waiting to try the Rachael Ray line and when I finally did I was blown away. I could tell the quality of the pans was unlike any others. The construction was excellent, with ergonomic handles for better gripping, induction stove top compatibility, and excellent heat distribution. Plus, with the diamond-reinforced construction, it was scratch and tarnish-resistant too!|0
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918 . In fact ,  when it premiered, it was just over four hours long. Its immense running time was because it was so controversial and vast in scale that directors H &L Pik Novice needed time to explore a full narrative across their 40 odd scenes. Each of these scenes tried to explore social expectations, address oppression of those without power and think about the obligations we owe to people within society, considering key arguments for the proponents of peace at a time where society was changing fast and instability threatened in more ways than one.|0
"It 's up there with Where 's Poppa , The Groove Tube , Putney Swope . It memorializes the NY  comedy scene before the advance of punk

Coincidentally it ties in with important subplots involving taboo movements such as Punk and Hip hop, becoming evident even within its narrative. Death to Smoochy further gives testament to the laid back comic movement beginning to morph. Up to then edgy portrayals would often substitute laugh for gruesome disruption that'd piss people off without anyone having a clue it was lightened with metaphor. Death To Smoochy built off from predecessors pushing comedy thresholds testing open thought contexts wrapped around subjects nobody saw coming!"|0
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. We get the laugh when Columbo makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery.This is another good Columbo-episode, and I will rate it 7/10.|1
"A very weird, psychedelic, esoteric, (and did I say weird? :) experience.But on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, Hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program and the adult, musically growing and evolving, and yet still a little silly Monkees of the '70s and beyond.The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith's, ""If they think we are plastic now, wait till they see how we do it."""|1
The Monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. Yes, they might have been the original manufactured rock band; a gimmick that certainly has reached overkill in the 21st century. However, their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, (I'm Not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters such as Boyce/Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen/King and John Stewart.|1
I first saw The Victim ( aka Out Of Contention ) well over 25 years ago when I was very  young. I still remember how enthralled I was as I watched it; the story drew me in and captivated me as the stakes of the central characters climbed ever higher. Ever since, I have remained a big fan of the movie, feeling very lucky to have witnessed its special qualities, which still stand up after so much time. Watching it never fails to entertain me and many of my friends and family members I have encouraged to see it often comment that they too understand its timeless qualities.|0
"I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from ! For  a long time the cinema was my sole provider for stories but since becoming increasingly difficult and inaccessible due to lockdowns it was nice to have this available

Renting DVDs from the shop felt like a breath of fresh air and opened my world to stories and worlds from long ago that I couldn't explore until then. This DVD rental was only one of a selection available from the store which also recommended some fantastic films and tv series."|0
"I 'm not a massive Disney fan , but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them 

I thought I would buy him the Lion King to start off. I must admit that watching the movie myself was amazing! I forgot how beautiful the animation was and how much detail is in each and every frame. The scenery and visuals were absolutely stunning. We then went and watched a few other classics, like Bambi and The Little Mermaid. Watching them, we both enjoyed reminiscing on those care-free days of our childhood, feeling young and naive once more."|0
I think that this short TV series, was absolutely wonderful, and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. This is definitely worth peoples money!I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the 'Blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life!|1
"I am a guy , so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear  was to do

But despite that, I couldn't resist the temptation to watch it. After watching the movie, I must admit that Richard Gear had done justice to the character. The way he brought the intense moments alive had an extra ordinary effect. He captured the essence of the script, making it true-to-life. I was impressed by his depth of performance, emotional appeal and charisma he gave to his character."|0
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. I guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. This movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented.|1
This interesting film noir features three very good performances : Sanders , Patrick , and Blackmer . The scenes between  these three actors are some of the best of the movie . Their chemistry comes through clearly, as each character competes for dominance of the plot in unique ways. Sanders is always reserved yet intimidating; Patrick acts strong, hiding her inner turmoil beneath a composed face; and Blackmer manages to draw on hidden reservoirs of anger and remorse at a moments notice. Overall, the trios dynamics never fail to provide an engaging plot which has the audience at the edge of their seat.|0
SHOWTIME is a mess , but it 's an entertaining mess . The plot is forgettable , the satire is  bizarre , but the visuals are beautiful. Despite the script 's cliché moments, it presents some intriguing themes that cleverly incorporate both light-hearted humor and horror . What really makes it great are its magnificent, distinct colors and elaborate production design. Even though the cinematography often cuts corners with shots and montage that too-explicitly spell out what we 're seeing, its patchwork is held together by luscious hues, juxtaposed imagery and comical expressions. SHOWTIME elevates its somewhat overused concepts with its artistic identity, creating a viewing experience like no other.|0
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans chaired by a no-nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth. But the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market place and the political system demands that he conform, rendering him no different than his predecessors.|1
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time . Top 20  of all-time for me for sure. The movie gave me feelings and emotions that I never expected to experience when watching. It was engaging and thrilling at every second, and kept me glued to my seat for its entirety. The overall plot and characters were interesting, the ending felt satisfying and the soundtrack and visuals were fantastic. Watching this movie has easily become my favourite past time and I'd urge everyone to check it out - it truly is a great example of cinema.|0
"I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. I'm forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable.The movie is plagued by it's low budget. (One atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, ""Siskel & Ebert"".) But, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate."|1
I wish there were more films about middle aged people . The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of  the adventures middle aged people endure tend to get overlooked. Many of us are reinventing ourselves as the children leave home and we enter this often joy-filled, new stage of our lives. However, much of our enthusiasm can sometimes fade when the enthusiasm of youth slowly fails to recognise our work as true art or doesn't realise the vulnerability, creativity and level of wisdom we possess. We deserve the celebration and awe experienced by generations after us who romanticise our lifestyle and adventure.|0
"Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. Sayid plots a plan with Jack to surprise ""The Others"" in case Michael is double-crossing the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.This episode is one of the best of the Second Season. Unfortunately, we lovers of ""Lost"" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans."|1
I was 19 or 20 , years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City , Utah and  attending college. I was still in the early stages of adjusting to this change and life. One summer day, I remember my first free day feeling overwhelming - like I had more choices than I could handle and they all needed to be perfect. Despite being over excited to not have any set plans, I wanted them all to work out. I wasn't sure where to start, so I decided to spend the morning with my laptop creating my own bucket list.|0
Another enjoyable Warner flick . I really liked John Garfield in this , though I 'm wondering why Cagney was  never part of the gang . I'm also wondering how different it would've been with Cagney's charisma and edgy on screen presence - no one ever exudes cool better. Nevertheless, the main leads steal the show. With Spencer Tracy delivering his always cool style and timing, you get a genuine pleasure out of the way he toys with character weaknesses to amuse and inflame their antagonism and sense of abandonment. On top of that, Raoul Walsh has great lines for comedic banter and commentaries.|0
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: ""Captain Correli´s Mandolin"", just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful. But there were saving graces.The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability."|1
I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.|1
"Easily Lucio Fulci's most respected film, ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter, gruesome imagery, and strong storyline. Terror befalls a small Italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Someone else? Contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content - I consider it much more plot driven; featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards)."|1
"I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times . I taped it in about 1987 when it  first aired

Over the years I've probably seen it over twenty times now and every single time, it just gives me such a wonderful feeling. It speaks so closely to my heart that every time I'm watching it, it gives me such nostalgia and heart-warming feeling like I've been brought back in time. I definitely rate this one 5 stars because of how incredibly thought-provoking the film was, it makes me connect emotionally on so many levels with the characters and events throughout the film."|0
This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.I don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I haven't even read the book, and guess what?|1
Between sweeping , extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded  in true crime. The powerful actors cast in lead roles bring even further life to an emotive and unexpected narrative, set over three unique eras of India's post independence story. Period sequences a wealth of accomplished supporting talent all adding to a special and meaningful ride. There is never a dull moment - indeed each dynamic chapter unlocks questions to which no-one can accurately anticipate the answers. Equally stirring soundtrack that knits the story together exquisitely makes it all the more moving.|0
"I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car ""to get stripped"" deserves whatever happens to them.The guy, Wade who ""went to a barbershop and asked for the He-Man haircut"" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. That's a little too high-maintenance for me. Also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks ""like Elton John only gayer,"" but that whole plot goes nowhere!"|1
"This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is ""Amazing"" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain."|1
Yes , at times `` Unconditional Love '' overwhelms as it bounces -- no , as it ricochets -- from  heart to heart! Our expectations expand as it radiates, affects, engulfs and shields our senses, bringing life joy and charm. Every relationship enhanced , stability is extended, principles become integral and indispensable even to generations that carry the immutable emotions further. Every whisper creates an equal-like exclamation, admiration shared runs zillions like infinity into directions together or divide. Every drop shines fiercely vibrant each time emerging beyond commonness growing resilient bequeathing love through centuries with magic reciprocating growing spell.|0
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread . Louis de Berniere 's books have consistently won awards for their clarity of expression and originality, and I was hoping for something similar from the film version. Fortunately, my expectation was rewarded. From the clever scripting, inventive sets and passionate direction, this film soared to the heights that I had wanted and then exceeded it. I was literally mesmerized from beginning to end, thrilled to have encountered characters that captivated my imagination. Each cast member embraced the beauty of the written characters in the film.|0
Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie, was years earlier a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Don't Torture A Duckling. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town?|1
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. Nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on DVD neither on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How it's possible this could really happen??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and James Franco is hot as hell!! !Please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!!|1
"They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film , The Life of Jimmy Dolan 

They Made Me a Criminal focuses on an boxer turned gang member by the name of Johnny Brady. It follows his transformation from a life of hard fought victory to the tough streets of LA, with his morals seemingly sinking with each scrap and knife fight. The moral grey-area John operates in, fighting both ‘law enforcement’ and his gang, throws up question marks over both groups with results he hopes to improve, albeit no positive certainty can be guaranteed."|0
I just thought I would add another observation , here . While there are a couple of visual sub-references ,  like someone practicing telekinesis or shots of crystals in different frames, these didn't detract much from the original intent. What I did observe, however, was a repeated reference to strings and continuity - at both levels. I think this represents a point to grasp when building new abstract visuals - don't rush to introduce a ton of other ideas, but allow yourself some simple steps and backtrack from the first thing to something tangible.|0
"Yes, at times ""Unconditional Love"" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, unconventional flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film."|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling  dialogue. However I was pleasantly surprised when the movie turned out to be engaging and deep in its storyline. The acting was well done and the cast fit into their respective characters very well. The script was surprisingly nuanced, and each character developed over time. There were humorous and emotional moments that came naturally rather than feeling forced and superficial. As the film developed, so too did my appreciation and admiration for the direction, pacing and style.|0
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly ( 1936-1959 ) is a tour de force for  Gary Busey, the actor who plays Holly. Busey encapsulates both the persona and musical styles of Holly in a gripping performance of style and power. He wins over a reluctant Father figure and risks much for a timeless Rock and Roll tour that never got to begin, playing venue across America with Elvis and more icons of their times. Buddy died too young at just 22, his dream undone and those who got to know him losing someone really special.|0
"The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen : much better and deeper than Luhrman 's ""Romeo and Juliet"". It gives an unforgettable experience while showcasing some valuable lessons that viewers can take from the story, from learning to trust your heart in spite of hard times, to cherishing family and love when you have it. Additionally, The Snowqueen depicts romantic relationships not only with honesty but with complexity. Although its bittersweet end will bring tears to your eyes, it still sends out an extremely powerful message of compassion and everlasting friendship."|0
"A beautifully photographed and paced short film . It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the  lingering angst that can surface in uncomfortable familial settings

The family bickers over trivial issues and there is a lot of subtext underlying the conversational encounters. The conversations circle but never move forward, leaving some conclusions tacit. But each one knows their place and the world order inside their apartment block. There are poignant moments of tears and an inexplicable something hanging between them. There's a claustrophobic atmosphere building throughout and suddenly they come to a stillness; allowing an almost unexplainable feeling in."|0
This version of `` The Lost Horizon '' is actually not a bad film at all . I think the  characters are surprisingly well portrayed , especially for the limited technology of the time . It was much improved upon with recent remakes which adds updated visual effects and storylines that stay closer to the original novel . Yet the iconic moments remain. Robert Conway trying to fix the broken airplane, the elderly monk stumbling upon their crash, or even the dazzling paradise of Shangri-la all stir an unforgettable spirit and thrill that could only be born in 1933.|0
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen ! The images that are  portrayed in this film really tell a story in and of themselves. The sheer beauty of what is on display makes it almost as if we have entered into a whole different world and witnessing its wonders in action. The scenes created and expertly composed with much attention to detail give us insight and great joy as if to share a journey through the souls of some remarkable people, through and over the decades that these stunning visuals lay.|0
Really , This movie should be released to DVD . I just got a bootleg copy of what I think  might be the pre-released version and can’t wait to watch it. I plan to make this a movie night with all of my friends so I can properly take advantage of having the rare pre-release copy. We're going to need plenty of snacks to power through it and will stock up on lots of candy, chips, popcorn and maybe a few energy drinks for the times it gets too late for the sleepyheads.|0
"Like some people here , I love/loved Stingers ! In Norway it got aired a lot later . That also  had it's positives though; With more people around me I finally got to talk and gossip about the TV show I was passionate about

I felt excited each time a new episode was released, as this meant I finally got to experience the twist and turns with my peers and family. All the buzzing in our neighbourhood made the experience even more thrilling. It took some adjusting to since all of us were already tuned to another TV series. Eventually everyone fell in love with Stingers."|0
"I 've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark . I 

The critical reactions seem to contradict themselves as many also make mention of Showtime’s impact on them in positive ways, including taking audiences on an unexpected and much appreciated journey of self-discovery and understanding. Through incredible casting, quality music selection and of course timely storytelling, Showtime immerses viewers in the struggles and lives of characters many had otherwise felt alien to. This appreciation translates to messages viewers must face regardless of their personal preferences and inspirations."|0
I really enjoyed this film , it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat . It was very  exciting to follow the protagonist and his journey in a very compelling manner. The protagonists were well portrayed and were able to convey complex emotions very naturally and effortlessly. This is a rare feat, particularly when trying to translate the turmoil from being from a very troubled individual's view point. Watching how the different characters interact with one another as the tension slowly increased created an engaging atmosphere for the audience. While the cinematography wasn't very adventurous, there were still unique compositions that helped compliment certain emotional parts of the narrative.|0
Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh : as the Monkees reduce their entire career  to 8-bit sound bites! Written and directed by Bob Rafelson, Head helped popularize music videos, fusing seemingly absurd snippets of iconic stars - Bob Dylan, Sonny Liston and others - in an ongoing episodic collage. Reflecting the era’s experimental attitude and vibrancy, the film sits alongside classic songs of The Beatles and Rascals that, some how, coexist with Sal Mineo promoting nudist colonies! Nothing made perfect sense; just like the era.|0
To say the truth , I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor . I have always had great respect and admiration for his work, and so I decided to check out this particular movie even though the reviews were not that great. Even though the storyline had its flaws, the acting performance from Nicolas Cage was absolutely breathtaking. He had a great chemistry with other characters and knew how to create a magical, intense and amazing atmosphere with his emotions. Overall, it was a memorable experience for me and I definitely plan to go to the theatre for Nicolas Cage's upcoming projects.|0
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution, although the war was nearly over by the time of its release. The tramp goes to war, humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the bum. It's a very funny film, although I don't think it nearly one of his best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his better output for First National before he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid.'|1
I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place. The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. I loved this show from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!|1
This movie got better with time. I can't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this at the age of 15. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man.|1
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film , like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles , as just another  violent , eye-candy filled bit of escapist entertainment . Others are not as so readily dismissed, pointing out the richness and detail of Bronson's often very tightly defined roles and even the nuances of his physical presence onscreen. Many attribute this talent to Bronson's association with well known action director John Sturges as both frequently team together for collaborative efforts on more complex , grittier works . These roles arguably prepared Bronson for for more substantial leading character turns later in his career .|0
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less takes place in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer Joseph Minion's comedy, 'After Hours.' In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents.|1
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo ' ( hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door ' ). The film was deeply touching and had an incredible, soul-searching effect. The story line revolved around a young southern Italian peasant family immigrating to the U.S. during the early 20th Century. Even though we are several decades removed from the era portrayed, I was deeply moved and sympathetic with the families difficulties in making it in a strange new world. They took courageous, momentous risks to achieve a dream - the American dream.|0
Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot!|1
This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a John Hughes movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable's scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day.|1
I just ca n't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense . It was never supposed to ! It's written by a team of comedic writers and satirizes society as we know it. It mocks politicians, celebrities, news and entertainment outlets, and the internet - a particularly amusing set of objects if one steps back and considers it. Of course the movie won't make sense if you think it's meant to tell a traditional story, but that's beside the point. People should be embracing the farcical yet essential lessons it offers instead of making useless criticisms!|0
"I always liked this movie , I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it : ) 

The comedy is incredibly funny and all the characters are so lovable. Every time I watch this movie I end up laughing non-stop. The ending always brings tears to my eyes as it highlights how all of the main characters found family, happiness and love through difficult times. This movie reminds me how important it is to be positive, work together and cherish each day like it was your last. Seeing it so many times helps me reflect, let go and open my eyes to my reality."|0
The `` all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... '' scene was a riot . I  couldn't help but chuckle every time. It seemed like everyone was making the same joke about not being able to do much with just five dollars and a wedding ring. The reactions of the people around me ranged from understanding smiles to uproarious laughter. While the line itself is humorous, the facial expressions and reactions it received only heightened the funny mood. Of course, this might not have the same effect without the warmth of an audience.|0
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film? Probably someone. But no-one, truly no-one, could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film.Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as shown to us right at the beginning, he has huge trouble communicating. So it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member Rory (James McAvoy) who can speak normally, understands him.|1
The movie does n't take itself seriously , and if you follow its lead you 're going to have a  great time. It isn't exactly a game changer, but it certainly achieves the goals that it sets out. There is plenty of action, but also plenty of humor too, even a romantic moment between the two protagonists that doesn't quite feel forced. If you want something easy to watch but not an easy ride then you're sure to enjoy the movie. It isn't one to over think either - its simplicity actually leaves more room to enjoy what's actually on offer here.|0
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families  to go in search of greater opportunities abroad. When they embark on the treacherous and sometimes ill-fated mission of traversing across vast and unfamiliar borders in pursuit of the allure of European promises, their risk is slowly revealed. Not all are able to sustain the tiresome road and huge costs associated with navigating complex immigration policies; not all manage to break down the looming bureaucratic, ethnic and racial barricades encountered by ambitious African asylum seekers and migrants on a quest for a better life abroad.|0
Like some people here, I love/loved Stingers! In Norway it got aired a lot later. That also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers might be the on series(except from Grey's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personallly I think she is one of the best access we have!|1
No. I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don't Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm.|1
Although this film never attained commercial notoriety , my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of  cinematographic art fly just below the radar of recognition. I had heard of several indie movies getting such love that got converted into full feature films, with wide releases and much commercial success. Such moves revealed to me the creativity which drives even seemingly unknown work which hold substance and further need support in order to gain public adulation. Small artists or no name production houses will thus remain driven to try and succeed by uncovering original gems of storytelling that remains unseen until audiences discover it.|0
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo&Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kay is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for Mister Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay.|1
Then again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. I have to alter just about everything she makes as I am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. The studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. Some people have posted that the show sucks.|1
"Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars ( The Monkees and Victor Mature ) ,  but for everybody 

Unfortunately, Head is generally misunderstood and was declared a failure after its debut. Critical recognition was not widespread at the time but subsequent re-releases gave the movie some attention and esteem. Despite mixed reviews, a variety of talent has become evident since Head was made and while there might not have been instant success it set the stage for ground breaking works of film which spawned other daring works, at times cited as being inspirational by filmmakers in the business."|0
`` Showtime '' is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro ( Meet the Parents , A Bronx Tale )  and Eddie Murphy ( Coming to America ). It's an amazing ride as the two switch roles to pursue an unexpected goal - and must outwit an IRS agent as they're pursued through Italy and across Europe! A thrilling cat-and-mouse adventure takes these two mismatched comrades all the way from Paris to Barcelona - with great action, and outrageous fun all along the way! Expect hilarious banter as they laugh, race and occasionally get into scraps, and fight to finish what they started and succeed with their far-fetched scheme.|0
"First off , I absolutely loved this movie . As a Billy Crystal fan , I must say that I  felt extremely emotional 

The script of the movie is so amazing with lines filled with honesty and humor. At the same time, you'll find yourself emotional as it captures life lessons as it unveils its hidden treasures in every scene. What more, the execution and transitions are fluid enough to even keep kids intrigued by the film. Even the finale of the film left me in a state of awe that words could not even begin to describe."|0
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, is the story of a kid named Bartleby (Justin Long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. Not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. But behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the American educational system.|1
Better than it has any right to be , this movie died a quick and painful death at the American  box office but is now recognized as an example of unconventional independent cinema at its finest. Fortunately, despite its box-office struggles, it has since become widely-recognized as a cult classic. Critical reception of the movie has remained highly positive since its release and, in the present day, is almost universally hailed as an underground masterpiece. The creative minds behind it even enjoyed a retrospective career surge in later years, mainly driven by the fan’s glowing recognition of their impressive original vision.|0
These critics need to find a new job!!! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY, which has made history. It illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece has captured my heart and soul as if I too were there. The Blue eyed Cage & the delightful Cruz were amazing! Together they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. This movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!! !|1
"""Head"" is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968. The movie is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image. It presents the Monkees in a way their fans never perceived them; men with real thoughts. Totally controlled by their producers, the Monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film pokes fun at their image, the entertainment industry, and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It's a movie well worth seeing over and over again."|1
"TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year . You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime , especially during the ""Bloody June"" holiday special. It seems that nowadays true-crime has taken over the TV network’s primetime lineup, making crime drama movies mainstream, an adrenaline rush of shocking reveals and moral dilemmas. Despite some bad takes on real life, actual criminal cases and overwhelming sensitive information – it has pushed people to educate themselves more on our society’s criminal justice and, through it, call out a world with higher injustice and crime rates than ever."|0
"Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne's ""For The Flag"" by the Czech master director Karel Zeman.Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety."|1
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave . I 'm happy with that ,  but in my view most of these new releases lacks something . Many of these movies aren't unique in the way they've presented the elements of the genre, oftentimes lacking the originality or dynamism that SCREAM provided. It feels as though we, as audiences, are consuming much of the same concepts with a handful of gimmicks every year, leading to a sense of stagnation for the genre as a whole. Not to mention the significant decrease in fear and horror each entry leaves.|0
"My favorite show of all time ! Yeah , I thought this was so cool , and Larisa Oleynik was  definitely my idol 

I would watch it almost everyday and record the new episodes so I didn't miss an episode. I really liked the way Larisa brought a balance between work, education, family and personal life. I used to get inspired from her confident and independent attitude and characters of different age in the series. Each episode presented different situations which made you look at life differently. I realized how we can experience several circumstances without any knowledge about it beforehand."|0
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or its director/co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also its other co-writer (and brief cameo) Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them seem to shun it, and to outsiders the movie is regarded, at best, as a curio.While the T.V. series was famously based on the antics of the Beatles' 'Help! ', this film is also judged by the same accord. Yet far from the trite and painfully overrated Beatles films, and even the dated Monkees T.V.|1
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island ) that keeps  all kind of unique secrets hidden throughout the story. It tells a sweet yet haunting tale that doesn't fail to stay true to the idea of simple happiness even under tragic circumstances. Life in the island flows as smoothly and serenely as the wavy coastline. Despite facing war and hardship, people don't lose hope and make peace their destiny. In conclusion, this heartwarming story offers a variety of well-depicted mediterranean characters and brings forth its beauty with enticing dialogues and lively details of the picturesque environment.|0
I'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. This is the definition of being a horror film. I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part.|1
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as just another patchwork of mindless violence. And while there is a fair amount of mayhem, DEATH WISH 3 is not that awful of an effort, particularly for fans of the series and its star.This time out, aging Charlie's Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory, where he once again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good versus evil.|1
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol ' says it all . I used to watch  movies just for the fun and pass the time with friends .However, lately I've begun to view films from a more critical point of view.I usually watch a movie before I give a review, otherwise my opinions could be influenced by word of mouth. Plus, by taking in every subtle detail I'm able to make well-informed decisions about which movie to recommend and which one not to. Sometimes I watch a movie with some popcorn, so I can get lost in the story.|0
I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a  concert deserves what they get. Sometimes things don’t go as planned and someone in that situation may experience public humiliation and worse, even being charged with criminal offenses. Being dumb can have serious consequences! But more importantly, being dishonest and trying to deceive security personnel doesn’t help matters. What happened should serve as a reminder to would-be dummy-goers that you should never risk being fake - always follow the proper processes for obtaining access. Taking shortcuts never pay off!|0
"Ross Hunter 's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy , based on James Hilton 's enduring bestseller , was written  by Grace Holdon and Alfred Drake and starred Anne Francis , Burgess Meredith and Martin Benson

It proved to be Ross Hunter's most financially successful motion picture of the 1950's and featured glamorous production design, brilliant performances and renowned costume design. It won two Golden Globe nominations including best picture in color as well as score by Leigh Harline and Lynn Ryle who provided the score. Upon its release, the remake was hailed for its unforgettable visuals, tender soundtrack and extraordinary performances from its talented cast, catapulting it to enormous success."|0
"""Showtime"" is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents,A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(Eddie Murphy)a cop, tries to arrest Mitch not knowing he's a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz."|1
"It 's just that . Chucky 1 was good . Chucky 2 was better . Chucky 3 sucked . Now  Chucky 4 is in the process of getting ready

Chucky 4 is being much talked about, creating waves across the horror movie fans around the world. Chucky has come a long way, over 30 years of evolution and for those who missed it all, the basics go like this. From when it started back in 1988 to the highly successful movie from 2019, it is looking more certain now that this time we'll get to meet the little ""Buddi"" again and finally put this legend to a full circle."|0
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it ( typical Malibu Barbie ) but the rest of the actors are just  fantastic . To make up for Paris, there is also Lindsey Lohan who has been so bubbly, outspoken and exuberant about the whole process. Other actors like Jen Aniston, Dax Shepherd and Ryan Reynolds all lend a hand with the success of the show. Of course, the genius director had done such a brilliant job capturing each personality, creating a lot of organic dialogue which flows wonderfully from one scene to another. We cannot overlook how powerful each actor's emotion could be.|0
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time . Quickly the movie grabbed  my interest and I ended up watching it right to the end. I wasn't sure what to expect but as I continued to watch, I became completely hooked by the story-line. I was engaged by every turn, some parts making me jump from the sheer excitement! I absolutely enjoyed every moment of this great film. Before I knew it, the movie had finished and it was far more enjoyable than I'd imagined it would be.|0
Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates `` Separate Lies , '' a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson , Linda  Bassett and Rupert Everett . The performances from each character combined masterfully, depicting the guilt and disbelief that emerge as dark secrets and lies surface.The film follows a married couple in a cheating scandal who, overwhelmed by secrecy and misinformation, quickly start spiraling out of control, the tectonic effects eventually cracking their tightly bound social world. Directed by first-time filmmaker Julian Fellowes , Separate Lies quickly moved beyond the cheating cliché in its exceptional performance, sweeping dialogue and layered script, becoming a hit among audiences everywhere.|0
No . I 'm not kidding with this one . He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave  movies with unfavorable ratings . He was notorious for speaking his opinion on movies regardless of what others thought. His reviews of horror movies, especially, weren't too favorable as he criticized and highlighted the major flaws of these films. But despite this, he didn't hold back his praise for excellent performances, even for a sub-par movie. His brash comments gave a humorous angle to many moviegoers and their debates online about a specific movie review.|0
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. The humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.Personally I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour.|1
I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I 'm dying to  know the title. Unfortunately, trying to track it down hasn't been easy. I think it starred a vampire-like being and something about the five phases of the moon. Every time I saw it I was riveted and have always been haunted by the memory of it. I've looked all over for this film but I'm still not sure who starred in it, who the director was, or even what decade it was released.|0
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid; and even then I sensed the silliness of it all. The low budget, horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then. I watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so.|1
Hey look , you do n't watch this movie to change your life ! But if you are female especially  if you're around my age - early twenties. You may find bits and pieces in there that might speak to you and give you guidance. It really hits home, specifically when it comes to balancing self-actualization and obligation, staying true to oneself while being in-tune to others, finding confidence without demanding to have your voice heard. Most importantly, it emphasises that learning lessons don’t come solely through having revelations but rather in giving your time and dedication.|0
That this film flopped at the box office , and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today , is  baffling. But to put that disappointment aside, let us take some time to look deeper into what the movie has to offer. By approaching it from different angles - from plot development to its unique styling - there is a lot to unpack. It offers something outside the established trends of cinema that once realised makes for an enriching watch, encouraging multiple viewings with different aspects of the production to focus on and study.|0
"This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally , at the end of the 1960 's 

This classic movie still entertains viewers of today's generation with its old fashioned visual flair and time honoured artistic elements, as well as some avant garde production techniques. Its story features themes that, despite being released in the 60s, still hold relevance, making it a film that spans all ages, be they young or old. Additionally, the impressive list of co-stars complements the sterling leading performance at every stage, highlighting a rich and competent cast who truly excelled on this memorable picture."|0
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film, The Life of Jimmy Dolan which starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM.|1
"As a film buff , I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny , sarcastic comments about this 

yet, when the long-anticipated movie was finally released , I made it a point to see it for myself. When I watched it, I didn't find it that terrible. Yes , it wasn't an amazing cinematic masterpiece like The Godfather or Fight Club. I believed it was average - an above-average for that matter. Some people claimed that the story was quite complicated, I have to disagree on this one - personally I understood the main characters motivations , themes and relationships quite well."|0
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. As with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we probably will never know.|1
"This is my favourite Columbo . Martin Landau ( excellent ! ) plays twins , one of whom may have  committed a murder

But the twist to this is that the twins look very similar, and the suspicion always circles both the characters as Columbo works to figure out the one guilty of the crime. During his investigation, it becomes very difficult to establish who committed the crime as Landau gives a fabulous performance of switching characters effortlessly. To add to the drama, Columbo mixes classic comical techniques that eventually break the serious mood but give his viewers enough information to start guessing."|0
I just thought I would add another observation, here. While there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; there is a special, physically tender, moment, toward the end. When the Enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer.|1
Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over.|1
"Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance/adventure. And by this, I mean ""good"", not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. East meets West in a different take on the buddy film. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth."|1
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic  divides. The story conveys the positive message that any entrepreneur - be they African-American, Caucasian, or any other race or ethnic background - has a realistic chance of succeeding as long as they bring courage, tenacity and creative ingenuity to the endeavour. And even though good business sense is essential, the characters in the film know they will have to use their resources as judiciously and as innovatively as they possibly can if they're to achieve financial success.|0
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Top 20 of my lifetime. I laughed more than I have since Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and cried more than I have since I saw The Notebook. If you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. It is real and powerful. See it and you won't regret it. I was reluctant at first and I only watched it because I had to do a school project about speech disabilities. But this movie is so much more than that.|1
Years ago I read the book ' A Máquina ' ( The machine ) . As I re-read this little  novel, it became apparent how some people could willingly make robots of themselves. The main character, Pavel, served as an extreme example of the robotisation of life, where social expectations confined Pavel to small actions like increasing sales, something that inhibited the kind of exploration he really needed in order to gain knowledge. In the end, it is through breaking away from his expected roles that he was able to finally connect with the beauty of being alive.|0
Charles Chaplin 's 'Shoulder Arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over  an hour . Shoulder Arms further illustrates Chaplin's idea that comedy is only successful if married with sentiment and human interaction. His usual strategy of blurring of class distinctions resonates throughout the film with rich bourgeois and deprived street boys bearing arms shoulder to shoulder, sometimes side by side in military services. Further poking of humour, mock skirmish puts his usual characterization of ever beloved underdog and modern protagonists amidst armoured cars in race for dreamy goal of capturing the enemy's ruler.|0
"Exclusively for Coop's lovers, though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc. ), as an older man, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. After ""the end"", I did not have the feeling that I knew the man any much better."|1
There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something `` not human '' is portraying human beings and  there acting very much the same. Cartoon films like Up and Lilo & Stitch have humanised their animal or extra terrestrial protagonists; despite their appearance they mirror real human behaviours, as they grapple with obstacles and use ingenuity to surmount problems. Even toy-stories Rex, an uncommonly scared dinosaur demonstrates symptoms of Anxiety and Woody, an outdated but seemingly self-confident doll harbors issues of low self-esteem. A shift in entertainment trend, these iconic works provide excellent positive representations of humility and collective spirit, ultimately crossing conventional entertainment boundaries.|0
A beautifully photographed and paced short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does.|1
First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one ! I watched  his movies before this one, they were also a hit but with this one he sure pulled out a larger crowd! He showed various raw emotions with the simplest yet powerful storyline. It focused on two lives thrown in different parts of the world and the delicate love story that brings them together. The importance of understanding one another's cultural values and backgrounds were depicted so thoughtfully and sympathetically. It's no doubt the best performance Ang Lee ever brought on the silver screen.The editing and the camerawork on this project were marvelous.|0
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards.|1
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love.|1
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It's a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the Nashville record producer told him no. Buddy Holly didn't give up on what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie.|1
"The `` old dark house '' sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the  horror, the 

With humorous imagery, complicated but gripping characters, and tension between fear and fascination, these classic stories embody a craft that reaches us even today. From mysterious entities waiting for curious heroes to elaborate (sometimes overtly Victorian) atmosphere, and courageous locals drenched with irony, we get great variety, as plots and situations keep refreshing even if protagonists rarely step away from narrative themes in use since Hitchcock popularised thrillers."|0
"In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD ( I 'm expecting to see the My Mother  the car collections),

things are no different with classic movie material. A wide range of classic and hard to find movie titles have made their way on to DVD and fans of classic movies have been treated to bonus features like never before. Commentary tracks, extended versions of old classic scenes, and recently a whole batch of new music tracks that fans never expected to have been uncovered. Those previously thought to be lost soundtracks are being turned into musical soundtracks and even score soundtracks and bonus CD's, CDROMs."|0
"Indeed , Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond . Though I 'm just wondering how 

Desmond and Elizabeth, who both appear to have quite distinct personalities, managed to connect. Despite these initial misgivings, Cynthia Watros, who plays Elizabeth, manages to beautifully capture a touching friendship between the two that quickly deepens throughout the movie. Watching the way their respective characters talk and grow more comfortable with each other makes their union more profound and sympathetic. While their personal conversations are funny, witty and delightfully entertaining, the one thing that ties it all together is their mutually honest, believable relationship."|0
"For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings , who love film ,  who enjoy intellectual explorations of historical artworks

Going to the cinema should be an exercise of curiosity as well as an opportunity to challenge one's mental growth. With films covering all varieties of culture, history and personal stories there is an ever-evolving element that fuels each and every film-lovers interests. Combining an aptitude for fine art with contemporary and cutting edge films has to be the modern film viewers ideal outing and something for the brain that satisfies on an individual level."|0
"Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good . I have to admit Ms Cruz  looked very elegant in the movie 

Nelson always played a good actor, too. I always like his distinctive take on acting roles. It gave a nice chemistry to the dynamic duo in the movie. Aside from Cruz's beauty, I liked how the set pieces were integrated into the story, especially that landscape in Greece. Not to forget about the themes presented in the movie about power, friendship, loyalty and love."|0
"I had heard of John Garfield , but , did n't know him . I loved this movie . I  saw it four times while I was visiting the city

The power of Garfield's acting was incredible and stayed with me after I returned to the suburbs. His understated portrayal brought a realism to the character's struggles that is hard to find. With each re-watching of the film, I found something new and more important to appreciate. His restraint as an actor was his strength, creating depth with minimal movement and occasional poise."|0
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!The cinematography is astounding, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they made it! Whether it is making models of creatures, or those impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it!2001 had some great tv shows to our screen.|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown on the career of director Winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it's never been topped. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate.|1
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.T inker, Oh Oh and Moccos. Together they take a journey, they visit the river and city while they get help from friends to reunite their family. There is non-stop laughter and so much adventure to be had! The script and animation are masterfully crafted, bringing life to all the characters. Each new journey has more humor, wonderful artistry and above all, heart-warming emotion. I have watched this movie more than a dozen times and each time it captivates me anew.|0
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role.|1
the first time I saw this movie , I just thought `` what the hell ? '' a 10-year-old kid  getting caught in such an intense case and making his first use of science & forensics for investigation and capturing the culprit. At that time, I felt quite proud for this boy! Watching the kid assess the situation from every corner was absolutely worth and so exhilarating that I loved every single second of it. As his finding progresses further and even reveal certain buried secrets that opens to finally reveal the mystery was simply heart-winning.|0
"Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode , THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best  Star Trek TOS episode out there. For the casual Star Trek fan, the scene between the Romulan commander and Spock was excellent television at its best, perfectly framing a tension-filled display of compromise in face of opposition. By transcending typical aspects of combat, like killing enemies and taking down foes, THE BALANCE OF TERROR impresses us as something higher. Where viewers typically believe they must ""Pick a Side"" - here it proves logical to cooperate with the opposing side and search for harmony amongst existing dissonance."|0
Another go round with the monkey king going west....sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes from the first frame onward.A monk and his three disciples go to a town to get the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world.But an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all of the children of the town. The evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. The retainers battle the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk off for safety (The monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys).|1
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it (typical Malibu Barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! I watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just a ace actor. Total hero man. The main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax!|1
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently received no credits. Too bad.All the Dead End Kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. It is odd to watch them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents ( I guess that should be Bowery ). They even show some swimming abilities.I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. My favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film.|1
Coming from the `` druggie '' generation , I thought this movie was hilarious . It definitely brought Jekyll &  Hyde together in a creative , enjoyable way . I related with Jekyll's anxiety to find friends while having Hyde do anything to keep himself accepted. Through hilarious shenanigans and run-ins, it perfectly conveyed the lesson of 'first impressions only last a short time before the reality sets in'. All of us could relate and despite how cheesy the ending was, we all genuinely cared for the characters in the end and their collective conclusion.|0
First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life.|1
"I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline . I go to the movies  so often

Since I hadn’t done much research before going to the movie, I went into it with little expectations. I’d heard good things and my curiosity won out. Even so, it managed to surprise and delight me! I wasn’t expecting it to have a sci-fi plotline and was pleasantly shocked. The characters and acting were enjoyable, too; all adding to the satisfaction that comes from having enjoyed a mystery film."|0
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback , and if anyone is confused about her past ( like  myself ) I'm glad she cleared up things in the show. Libby reveals to Desmond that she was locked up in an Australian mental institution. When Desmond wonders why someone would lock her up, she explains that she killed her former boyfriend years before. Although the circumstances behind why and how the boyfriend died remain a mystery, it was clear that she made a mistake that brought with it tremendous guilt. For years, she repressed her thoughts until coming to the Island sparked old memories.|0
"If you have n't seen this film , do it . Its a genremix as i 've never seen another  and your time will be well spent

You won't regret giving this film a chance. Despite it being a bit long, it will draw you in and make you forget where you are. Every shot carries something meaningful that won't leave you and a heart-thumping soundrack keeps the tension high, leaving you with that ending as an absolute wow moment. Go in not expecting much and be ready to walk out buzzing, anxious and anxious to return, armed with popcorn and excitement."|0
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I have seen most of her movies.I saw this for the first time on television when I was around fourteen, and I was so scared.I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much.I know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much.That just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so.I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you.|1
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time , and this film speaks volumes about how  modern architecture impacts our lives. His impact on society was wide-reaching, influencing everything from our surroundings and cities to the way people experience everyday spaces. It shows that the environment around us has been greatly shaped by what he did, a realization that has become especially significant in the current times of both civil unrest and mass redevelopment. Khan's mark will likely never be replaced. His blend of neoclassicism, Islamic architecture, and modernism laid a perfect example for those in the architecture world today.|0
"I don't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more ""Hollywood"". James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I cannot believe this is his first real film."|1
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground , and in particular the `` flowering  of an understanding `` of

At first, these two individuals had difficulty relating to one another, seeing only the disparities in the different cultural backgrounds they originated from. Despite this, a common thread emerged; a mutual understanding that brought together these two unique individuals. What ensued was a delightful period of compassion, admiration and appreciation for one another. This shifted from subtle acceptance and friendly attitudes to a mutually grateful connection."|0
"I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci's films. Most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining ""Zombi"" (which was a George Romero imitation), I didn't really enjoy them. I know Italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. This is why ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" surprised me. Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery."|1
"If you 've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts , here is a Zasu zinger ! In 1933  she took the quote

“Tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all” and spun it around for her comedic rendition “tis better to have stayed at home, than to have gone and lost at all.” Zasu was a beloved slapstick comedian who believed humor had healing powers. It helped people make the most of life by lightening up those bleak and painful moments of the Great Depression."|0
Separate LIES changed my life . Actually , the Q & A did.SPOILERS BELOW . Read only if you watch  all seasons! I was captivated from the start by the incredible cast, brilliant script and nonlinear storyline of Separate Lies. Even when a little sceptical at first of how things were going to play out, I could not have anticipated the mind-boggling answers presented to the cliffhangers during each episode. These moments became more thrilling each time with many left with open-mouthed shock in our shared viewing circles. There's no denying that the jaw-dropping climax at the very end of the last season had changed the way I think.|0
"An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, strikes him down dead, and keeps driving. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a ""stiff-upper-lip"" attitude towards tragedy."|1
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actor's were very good.|1
"Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy ( Garlin ) wandering around Chicago with  a jazzy script

Garlin further paves his comic style into this charming work about personal identity and male friendship. In classic folkloric form he spins what it means to exist, trapped and saved at the same time in a very familiar urban tapestry of swagger, joy, personal struggles and chance-driven luck. Viewers easily fall for the awkward intensity of Garlin’s soulful lost loner as he reinvents himself multiple times under amusing set pieces and uproarious bit characters."|0
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in  American society in the mid-1900s. The movie does a great job at demonstrating the seriousness of racial injustice, by taking us on a roller coaster of emotions. Through heart wrenching moments, tears and frustration, the film captivates its audience and builds empathy with its story line. The suspense builds as tension starts to tear at our feelings, rooting us to its conflicts between African Americans and White Southerners. A tussle of dignity, equality and patience make this picture one that audiences can never forget.|0
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London ( England ) . Enjoyed  a celebratory glass of champagne, caught up with old friends, watched other critically acclaimed films, and appreciated the huge honour. The overall atmosphere and spirit was wonderful, full of appreciation for filmmaking. Being in the very heart of such a beloved movie moment, I felt part of something greater than me, with no language barrier between all of us present. On this day, film served its true purpose: allowing people to come together and recognize great art, regardless of origin or circumstance.|0
This is one of my favourite Disney films . It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation , from talking animals to silly slapstick humour. One of my favourite parts about this movie is how all of the characters help one another and teach each other lessons about working together. Even though all of the animals were technically of different species and came from vastly different worlds, they found ways to live in harmony with one another and learn how to help each other and work together as a team. It teaches viewers a great moral and is an example of the power of togetherness.|0
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history, someone had to be the first. One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre.Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. When you consider that some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope, Abbott&Costello, Laurel&Hardy involved military service and made during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at.In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours.|1
"After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce , Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman 's remote  countryside home

Once Kate arrived at the home, she did her best to convince her sister to take the time to try and work through the problems with her husband and fight for the marriage she thought they once had. She shared her own struggles in her marriage and her successes in the difficulties that marriage brings. She spoke to Susan honestly, with no judgement, even understanding Susan’s trepidation with starting all over."|0
"Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) getting made CEO of a corporation after the white CEO dies (the white executives all hate each other and can't decide who should succeed the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization.I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! ""Putney Swope"" is the ultimate jab at America's power structure. It's the sort of thing that seems like it would have come out of Richard Pryor's mind."|1
This film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. These are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to America in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. They have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the United States which are disseminated on the trip over.|1
"I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age 

I will always remember his music as a reflection of a joy and youthfulness he shared with all. After his passing, there was an outpouring of emotion across America; everywhere you went Buddy Holly's music could be heard. His pioneering rock n' roll sound will be remembered throughout time. Generations of children of the fifties still reminisce and hum the notes of their favorite Buddy Holly songs. Every decade has something memorable to attach themselves too, and with Buddy Holly it is more than simply nostalgia."|0
**1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.Yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture.|1
A mix of 70 's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line . As I 've  just been presented, this satirical film created a mark in a chaotic comedic year. Though it received mixed reviews from fans, some calling it an eccentric mix between slapstick comedy and fairy tale fantasies, others referred to the film as ground-breakingly-fresh for its playful examination of relationships and conundrums between husband and wives. To put the over-dramatized nature into context, it wasn’t difficult to relate to and consequently influenced other creations with it's irresistible groovy flavor.|0
"""Caribe"" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. However, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, along with a magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of them embedding the other, each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. The story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great, and for that we owe credit to the emerging director, Esteban Ramírez."|1
"This film is an impressionistic , poetic take on the immigrant experience , a reflective look at the turmoil and  guilt 

It also dives into the displacement and courage of making a home in a foreign country, through careful considerations and explorations into difficult history and of leaving people behind in search of one's own identity and livelihood. This intensely personal drama is one which anyone who has experienced an emigration of any kind can relate to. For so many people the possibility of home never reaches beyond the imaginings of possibility that their hosts impose upon them, yet their dreams and ambition constantly reach across all distances to distant shores."|0
"When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.The force of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings."|1
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan , where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion . It is interesting how such a heavy, sometimes uncomfortable, story drew such a large crowd, almost unanimously eager to learn more and support its creators. Interestingly, all throughout the experience there seemed to be an overwhelming, mutual understanding in the room that cinema is just not the same. The collective, in-person experience enhanced the film watching; moments of surprise were immediately evident through screams, laughter and sometimes worried murmurs.|0
"Films belonging to the `` film noir '' genre usually contain similar elements : a `` deus ex machina ''  or a lucky turn of events at the climax, to put things in perspective; a usually misanthropic view on people in general, doubting that goodness truly prevails ;


Moreover, it can often feature a mysterious femme fatale with dubious motives; while often offing an unbearable emotional baggage as main storyline's key factor, with gothic atmospheres providing as somber contrast. The aim is always to depict moral struggles in bleak outlooks, by harshly blending artistic values into impactful scenes."|0
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen, However, I am only in the second season.The typical Columbo activities are both amusing and irritating. His cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before, And the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer--in this case cooking ,Tho the scene on the TV cooking show distracted from the main theme.Also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer. The reason was never explained ,nor did it serve any purpose.|1
"Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters . I had never heard of  this flick before,

Despite it never making it to the theaters, word of this hidden gem was starting to spread throughout the movie watching community. Everyone I spoke to raved about it, so I had to check it out. I'm so glad I did because this became one of my favorite movies and something that I'll never forget. This small film came out of nowhere to wow so many viewers who never thought they'd fall in love with it."|0
"This is one of the best of the early `` Star Trek '' episodes , with Kirk and his crew 

finding themselves back on Earth in the 1980s . While it's an episode loaded with nostalgic elements from our contemporary society ,
It has quite a shocking reveal too , when the crew realise that their environment and civilisation was not what it initially appeared. While at times things may not feel like how you wanted them to , accepting your new reality can sometimes be necessary . This thought-provoking episode highlights how we as human can make peace with any change by valuing new perspective on the same matters."|0
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I just rewatched it last night, I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres.|1
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick. But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.'|1
"This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life , the action was great , and i 

The effects in the movie were amazing; from the soaring helicopter rides to the heavy explosions, it was definitely a must-see for anyone who is into action movies. Furthermore, the characterization of the characters in the movie was highly well developed, giving the viewer a true sense of depth when interacting with them. Even though there were scenes that made me laugh, cry and everything in between, what stood out most was how inspiring the story was, truly making me appreciate it from a different perspective."|0
I thought this movie was pretty good ! OK , so maybe it had a few scenes that could make  a parent squirm, but all in all it was fun. The movie had plenty of interesting scenes and was an exciting roller coaster of action and suspense. It had well developed characters that you could both sympathize and despise, an unpredictable plot that left you guessing what might come next, and quite a few laughs along the way. This movie might be a little edgy for younger children, but any fan of action or suspense could have a lot of fun with this one.|0
"I know this movie is n't for everyone , and I wo n't push my opinions on you , but  I found the message inspiring

I want to challenge everyone to find something that they take away from this movie, no matter how they felt. Sure, it’s silly and unoriginal in some spots, but if you focus in on the positive then you could take something positive away with you. And that’s a lesson everyone needs. We all struggle, we all make mistakes, but to learn and grow we need to reflect on our feelings."|0
"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film ""The Enemy Below"" from the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer & German U-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars."|1
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.|1
"I absolutely adore this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in it, so I figured it had to have some worth, you know? I watched it the first time just shaking my head . . . huh? Then it was the last scene and I found myself aching from smiling so hard. I clicked ""play movie"" and watched the whole thing again. It is without doubt the quirkiest movie I've ever seen. But the more I watch it, the more I love it."|1
I've got to say it. Gary Busey saved this film. If it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. I recommend the film but just barely.The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the Holly sound?|1
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets up with them and offers to help them.|1
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Implausible scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, evil-for-no-reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hardworking citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them, only to be joined by the neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She's sweeping out the scum!|1
"What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' only naughtier. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde. The one scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: ""how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter."" Jekyll replies, ""but sir, I'm going ahead with the operation. ""Lanyon replies back, ""oh."|1
Being American , I have not been exposed to this character before , which is good because some of you  might recognize a controversial meaning. However, I've read more about it and done more research. To me, this character represents a message of resilience, adaptation and the survival of even the most extreme hardships. We can all be reminded that with an unrelenting determination and steadfast focus we can get through whatever difficulty life throws at us. It has helped remind me to remain positive in dark situations and know that brighter days will come if I just endure what life throws my way.|0
"Lucio Fulci , later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie , was years earlier a  more light hearted, traditional Italian movie maker

Prior to gaining recognition for his gory horror films, Lucio Fulci had been making fairly traditional, entertaining Italian comedies and dramas, light hearted and approachable by a larger audience. Many of his comedies, particularly from the 1960s, contained humorous moments accompanied with nods towards social issues. During this period Fulci gradually shifted away from traditional narrative as he pushed the boundaries and explored more offbeat, gory tales with surreal scenarios and tales of sadism."|0
The film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. I am the first one to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? Does every film have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Again, so what?|1
The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music . Filmmakers  like Sergio Leone, John Cassavetes and David Lean emerged to reinvent genre and provide an iconoclastic viewpoint to mainstream popular culture. Those of Leone offered wry comedic spins on familiar ideas, while Lean drew large and sophisticated budgets to produce striking drama like Lawrence of Arabia. Others in the 60s cinema landscape offered entirely new visions of narrative through wholly experimental art house and experimental projects. Directors like Ingmar Bergman explored themes of love, loss, faith, existential angst, and set up revolutionary new filmmaking standards.|0
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family 's journey from the Old World ( Italy ) to  the New ( United States). Once in the United States, the family face struggles both as a result of their separation from Italy and as they experience different climates, diets and surroundings in a new land. Furthermore, the adults encounter bigotry and struggles of adapting to their new job in America. Although their determination and courage sustain the family through difficult times, they still long to reunite with those they left behind and those who didn’t make it out of their old country.|0
When his elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.Although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!|1
"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I've seen my share. To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie.Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, Fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect."|1
What a surprise this film was . I 've seen a good few of Fulci 's horror and zombie flicks , but this was far from them. I really liked the transition that Fulci made in his movies. Going from his staple zombie films, to this brilliant dramatic piece was surprisingly exciting and refreshing. I enjoyed the moral lessons taught through the exploration of a grand moral dilemma that left me reeling from this intense, layered story. The camera shots used also impressed me and while at some points they had been stylized and raw, other shots seemed magical and left an ever lasting impression on me.|0
"Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man ( set in the harsh Sonoran desert),

As a homage to the sublime Sonoran Desert which straddles Arizona and Mexico, Motorama viewers should also consider familiarizing themselves with some of the art work featuring the unique and sparsely populated terrain of the Sonoran Desert by works of Nell Moody or photography of Sonny Szeto. The semi-wildlands present stunning visual opportunity not often noticed outside of the genre. Not only will exploring the themes of Motorama be interesting, it will leave them thirsty to uncover more pieces of the much untamed west."|0
Loved today's show!!! It was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too.|1
Chucky 's back ... and it 's about time ! This time , with the help of Jennifer Tilly and  the already iconic Mike Van Susan , he 's taken a bloody swerve down nostalgia lane , evoking some serious classic slasher feels . This time he's not just for children to cower at- no . This is the real deal . This time around Chucky's accompanied by more grisly and crude as his goals and intentions are so obviously criminal. Although fans are welcomed with nostalgic triggers of a beloved icon, new slashers don't think they'll be pulling their punches this time.|0
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love film, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny, smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you.For those with a poor attention span, high expectations and no brains.. well.. um.. you may get bored and find things dragging at times.This is a charming, modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through..This film is a little gem.|1
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London(England). Enjoyed it immensely. Although the Crow & the Chinese Policeman don't appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the Author (Writer/Director) voiced/played by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well.The rumour is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.Spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.|1
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. (MINOR SPOILERS) As per usual, the main character, B, is the sane one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. He's known for making fake IDs. so an acceptance letter is no problem.Because B's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university.|1
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughs keep coming almost every minute. It's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with Jeff.|1
`` I am ... proud of 'Head ' , '' Mike Nesmith has said . He should be , because  'Head ' has gone on to be recognized as an absolute classic and one of the pioneering works of what has come to be known as the film/mockumentary format. Mike has every right to be proud of the impact 'Head' has made in the movie-making business. It has often been touted as a groundbreaking accomplishment and continues to serve as inspiration to up-and-coming directors who want to try their hand at this distinctive kind of cinematic style.|0
`` Caribe '' is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects . However , it delivers a perfectly  enjoyable message. Caribe provides audiences with an unique outlook and highly enthralling story elements. With exciting visuals, endearing characters, and inspiring background score, this short animation deserves immense recognition and praise. At its core, Caribe narrates a touching journey that interweaves stories of resilience and determination with warm-hearted messages. Every segment in the movie echoes these messages as it brings its main characters closer to one another. Overall, it beautifully renders an intricate, realistic view of Caribbean culture without alienating viewers from its vivid depictions.|0
Like a few people I know, I came in late on 'Stingers'; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way I'd miss an episode. The show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'Blue Heelers', for example. The crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me.|1
A very suspenseful giallo from the director of `` L'Anticristo '' ( 1974 ) , this one begins with a  disturbing nightmare that features a rabbit puppet ... The rabbit appears again later, only this time its mask has shifted in position and something else is lurking behind it - a large bird with a gruesomely familiar face. As the sinister creature looms in the darkness of the protagonist’s mind, fear courses through the veins of the audience, anticipating the eventual reveal of the masked bird. An investigation ensues, uncovering sinister events of murder and arson that grow in intensity until a remarkable final scene.|0
"This is possibly one of my favorite films . It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda ( Chelsea  Salender ),

who travels across dangerous and magical landscapes, determined to save her beloved younger brother from the powers of an evil troll ( Stella Black ). Along the way, Gerda encounters friends like her Lark, who come from all different backgrounds and are a rainbow of possibilities, much like Gerda’s story itself. With love, loyalty and courage as her armor, Gerda forges a unique path for a new life in this spectacularly detailed retelling of the classic ‘ Snow Queen ’ tale."|0
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series. And, while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun, I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very best.The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts.|1
"Who ARE the people that star in this thing ? Never heard of them ! ! But this is one  movie that can only be watched once

The movie features a few fairly unknown actors and a script written entirely by first-time director. With its stunning visuals, bold storytelling and unique spin on romance, the film will make an unforgettable experience for the viewer. Fans of both thrillers and traditional romance should find a lot to like in the film. Critics from all corners have also responded well to it, even though many have never heard of the actors before."|0
"the first time I saw this movie, I just thought ""what the hell?"" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I enjoyed this movie a lot!Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a shame he stopped act. He interprets very well his character Gus on the movie.Gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!?"|1
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character . The humour  he delivers comes in a form of innocence mixed with foolery. It can seem to be hit and miss whether people take kindly to the comedic nature he delivers, some laugh hysterically, and other times it can fall flat on its face. But regardless, people have a love/hate relationship when it comes to Ali G, there is no one quite like him in the world of comedy and it will be some time before someone has the balls to do what Ali does in order to elicit such bellyaching laughter from audiences.|0
First of all , around the time I wrote this comment , I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written  . So after I read that, I tried to respond to them without triggering another one of these debates. I tried to politely offer another way of looking at the topic that could also be supported with evidence, though obviously kittiwake-1 disagreed with it. The debate raged for a few more posts, and as far as I know is still not fully resolved. There's probably going to be even more debate as the issue gains popularity.|0
What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'.The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered.|1
I absolutely adore this movie ! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store  and I am so glad that I rented it. It has become my go to movie and everytime I watch it I am still amazed by the detail and perfect storytelling. The way it transitions into each of the four stories at just the right moments was especially powerful. From the setting to the intricate writing to the magnetic performances of each character, I felt like I was getting an understanding of so many new stories, full of energy and life.|0
"This new installment to the Child 's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such  as a classic misunderstanding joke by Chucky

I am sure this installment to the Child's Play series will leave you crying with laughter. As the character ""Chucky"" makes sure that viewers do not have even a moment to feel scared. He will say all the classic horror dialogue while hiding his witty and amusing comments underneath. He may not have one jump-scare moment but he will make sure your side hurt with all of his laugh worthy lines that help turn an intimidating moment into a hilarious one."|0

As he learns about Louis's renowned architecture career and passionate, unpredictable personal life, Nathaniel begins to learn about and accept who his father really was - flaws and all. An incredible piece of artistic filmmaking, My Architect captures complex, conflicting themes such as abandonment, mystery, passion and joy. Along the way, Nathaniel gradually finds solace and the acknowledgement of the intimate connection he had longed to have with his father.|0
A Formula For Murder is n't a well known Giallo , but that is n't to say it 's not  worth the watch. Rather, it has all the hallmarks of a traditional giallo – dreary locations, shady characters, and a chain of linked mysteries with surprises at every twist. That's not all though, as it has an added layer of mystery and intrigue as Inspector Glenn Cooper must decipher an ancient numerical formula as part of his investigation, before his clues are his own undoing. An overlooked gem with unforgettable set pieces, A Formula For Murder is a forgotten cult classic of giallo.|0
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all.|1
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004 's Academy Awards , My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest  to unravel the mysterious life of his estranged father Louis I. Kahn , one of America’s greatest and enigmatic architects. Nathaniel travels to Bangladesh , Rome and Philadelphia , gaining new perspectives and details on Louis’ work and emotional landscape while being aided by fascinating conversations with experts. Despite meeting those that knew him , from long time associates to his neglected children and two wives , Louis remains a profoundly enigma leaving Nathaniel torn between family guilt and appreciation for an aesthetically magical legacy.|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.The film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from Muscular Dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, as Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying.|1
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode, beside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fiancé, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides Columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money.|1
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.This might sound picky, but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would YOU feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters.|1
"I do n't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business , but I have to  make an exception

Recently, I had a chance to watch the new Hollywood movie and I must say it exceeded my expectations. I liked the creativity with which the directors and screen writers managed to adapt the script from the novel to the big screen. The actors were excellent in their roles and made me feel an emotional connection with their characters. It was truly a work of art. The special effects were particularly awesome and extremely captivating."|0
"Telling the story would n't be the point at all , would it ? Barnens ö , spelled almost like  bö-Barnens o has been said by swedish authors many centuries ago, translating to ""Children's Island"", A small mythical place accessible only by children. Since the 1800s Barnens ö has been adapted to a wide range of childrens books and animated films and tv series, All portraying an air of imaginative escape, A tropical Island which plays host to all manners of oddities, fantastic events and one of a kind creatures and situations, far away from the doldrums of our everyday reality."|0
I do n't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor . You need  to take a step back and real ize that life isn't all about laughs and joy and we should also accept the bitter tastes life brings us every once in awhile. Humor that require intellect stimulates us more and gives us more room to talk about experiences, challenge each other and nurture our conversations. Intellectual humor is not a gimmick; it’s an excellent and challenging form of dialogue which motivates people to create the conversation and connect with each other in a more stimulating way.|0
"""I am ... proud of 'Head',"" Mike Nesmith has said. He should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.Yes, it's unconventional. To many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: ""You figure it out. ""You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain."|1
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see . The acting , writing and production values  of this production are extraordinary . The script is gripping from beginning to end, with breathtaking moments and impactful acting performances from the ensemble cast. There are lots of humorous scenes too. And most impressive of all is the final sequence – filled with power and emotion. It is worth mentioning too the incredible soundtrack that adds an unforgettable atmosphere to the overall experience. Simply put, this is one of those rare and beautifully-crafted masterpieces you would never want to forget.|0
I loved this film ! ! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see  it. I finally went to the cinema to watch it and I was pleasantly surprised. I found myself watching this film from start to finish in a single sitting. Every moment of the movie was beautiful, exciting, and had some humor to it as well. I especially loved the ending. I couldn't help but leave the theater with a feeling of contentment and delight. Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better movie to watch, it truly exceeded all my expectations.|0
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I've ever seen. Not only it's the mother of coincidence, but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction.Take this casualty for example, The US marine, whom gives Sayid the way to become a Torturer, Is Clancy Brown, playing a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he is playing Kelvin Inman, the Desmond partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh?|1
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Academy Award winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see.|1
I don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while I did. I got so engrossed I gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. And I sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but I was crying at the end. A lot of emotional nuance. Great acting, and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.|1
"1930's comedy mystery about ""The Crooked Circle"" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them. Enjoyable but really unremarkable little film, the movie works simply because the cast headed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver dropped out of that series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (I don't hence the lack naming)."|1
"I 've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much ) 

The hosts provide insight on all kinds of new releases, tech, news and everything you need to know in the nerd-verse. In particular, the hosts often include videos and quirky interviews to provide variety. I really appreciate their comedic outlook on current trends, tech and lifestyle related topics, which entertains and educates at the same time. Recently, Attack Of The Show introduced ‘The Feed’ - a show based on both rapidfire content from daily releases and also our viewers questions."|0
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius . And this movie is good ! Although the film does n't nearly reach  the absurd level of some of his past films , 

He has a knack for getting himself into these amazing comedic and often very outrageous situations with normal everyday people. Cohen also excels at eliciting hysterical reactions out of unwitting celebrities. His skillful eye for witty observations with often terrible ramifications on himself is really something that we don't often see. The ability to spin truth with lots of awkwardness and an uncanny finesse is pure genius."|0
Containing Billy 's famous humor , this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure , pleasantly  , from what people have come to expect from his movies. Still, with the laugh-out-loud moments and sharp script that Billy has always had a talent for, fans will enjoy this light-hearted romp. And it is still heavily linked to themes familiar to the cult classics of his catalog; the human connection, romance, growing old and maybe even getting just a bit wiser. Characters meet obstacles with easy faithfulness to comical reality and bumbling logic, not unexpected for Billy's veteran casts.|0
This is one of Chaplin's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More opulent than the Mutual films, it continues Chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front.There is plenty of slapstick via the Limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree.By this stage in this career, the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves.|1
"Let me clarify that. This is not a ""good movie"", but I am so glad it is out there, I am so glad I saw it, and for the role that it plays in my DVD collection, it is sublime. It is the ultimate PG-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on Mars. It is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable."|1
Barbora Bobulova 's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time . Valeria embodied both innocence and maturity, carefully blurring the boundaries of her life-altering choices and growing responsibilities. This comes with full, moral implications not to judge Valeria for her decisions; that in fact the only entity worthy of knowing what is best for the character of Valeria is Valeria herself. As a result of Barbora's captivating portrayal of Valeria, I could easily identify with Valeria’s stories and come to a place of great sympathy towards her development as an individual and personification of youth.|0
"Lucio Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.This surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later Fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.The soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;Bruno's near-seduction by the naked Patrizia(Barbara Bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.Highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite ""House with the Windows That Laugh""(1976)."|1
"Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre , but I think this one is done quite  well

I believe everyone is entitled to their own opinions and thus must respect them, however, my opinion on this genre is vastly different. I appreciate that the piece utilizes very vibrant colors, perhaps to captivate its audience and serve as a counterbalance to its whimsical styling. On a deeper level, I was drawn in by the contrast between the creator's story and the listener's imagination that blossomed while hearing the beat."|0
Years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The machine). As I re-read this little book again and again, I could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the Brazilian culture.When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.I can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text.|1
When the trailer for Accepted first came up , many people began to get excited about seeing it ... really . As time passed, the date when it was to be released drew near, and the pre-released screenings became even more coveted by avid moviegoers. By the time it was finally released in theaters, everyone had already built up quite a bit of hype around the movie. Expectations were sky high, and when moviegoers stepped into the theaters they couldn't contain their enthusiasm any longer. Upon viewing, people found the humor and message within the movie to be inspirational and relatable.|0
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock, Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage angst.This easy to watch bio is not without flaws.|1
"But a great cast ! Jonathan Pryce , Kathy Bates , Rupert Everett , Lynne Redgrave , Julie Andrews and  Nicole Kidman just to name a few 

This dream cast makes the movie one that could compete on Oscar night. Each member contributes not only great talent but some beautiful additions to the costumes and design of the film, helping to truly make the setting and scenes truly enchanting and captivating. Further casting included Cate Blanchett, Judi Dench, Tony Curtis and Jean Pierre Leaud to ensure the legacy of a brilliant array of casts on screen, inspiring admiration and adoration in their wake."|0
"*Could contain spoilers, read only after seeing last episode season 2* Think about it. The guys on the north pole? Center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: ""did we miss it again?"" So there was another abnormality? Of course that was when the plain crashed! I think this whole Island is a setup. Set up by her daddy. She found out about it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for.So basically it's an Island in a magnetic shield."|1
"*May Contain Spoilers*The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was around 8 years old. Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. ""The Aristocats"" was a cute heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. In fact I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it that much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I ever saw."|1
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I doubt it!Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie off of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever.Of course.|1
"If we could have ""Separate Tables,"" why not ""Separate Lies. ""This becomes somewhat involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. The latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. To complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident."|1
"Exclusively for Coop 's lovers , though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this  remake , we sadly discovered 

that many key pieces of character development and intertextuality with Westerns and old myths were cut out for pacing, making for a hollow action experience. There are still moments of decent humanist vibes in the process, especially at its concluding reveal, yet too many unfortunate occlusions subside what could’ve been an event much more self-aware. While it holds weight on the large scenes involving superheroes, smaller events and heartbeats don't seem to follow along throughout and arguably shortchange it."|0
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is done quite well.It's twistedly cute clever & dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child.Also, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. Sure there is some Burton influence here, but I wouldn't say this Brad is trying to rip him off.He is just jumping in & adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate.|1
Let 's be fair : there are no RULES for scriptwriting , so I wo n't say the movie SHOULD  have been written in a certain way. Rather, let’s look at it from a storyteller’s point of view; although the movie can be looked upon from a critic’s lens and criticism shared for future improvements, ultimately it was an entertaining experience with both tears and laughter to enjoy. As an avid reader and lover of cinema, there were a couple of creative moments that came off as unpredictable and genuinely awe-inspiring that makes the film worth watching and provides perspective on life's struggles.|0
At one time `Buddy Cop' movies ruled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a T.V.|1
If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie , this wo n't be one for you . If  you’re wanting an emotion evoking thought piece - this is right up your alley! This story starts out simple enough and though at first sight you won't see your ordinary A-list hollywood thriller, your emotional thriller awaits with characters jumping off the page and lively moments both expected and unexpected alike. Beyond the slow build and mounting intensity lies an intertwined storyline with multidimensional characters aiming for love and redemption. Prepare for scenes that might seem crazy, and venture beyond expectations, because sometimes the more unconventional tales get rewarded.|0
"I love this movie a lot . I must get this on DVD . I have 2 VHS copies ,  but i know

DVD's are much better and that will definitely give me better clarity when watching it. This movie was made such a long time ago , but the power of its message is still true even to this day. So far , I've shown it to my family and some of my friends and they loved it. But I would love to watch it again with the new found clarity a DVD could give me ."|0
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna, and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. The animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy.|1
"Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including ""N.I.B. "", ""War Pigs"", and ""Paranoid"".Also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans."|1
"This was a riveting film , one that really drew me in . I 'm a big fan of William  Douglas ' movies, so I was thrilled to get to watch one that he 'd directed himself

I was hooked right away with the amazing visuals and talented cast of actors. Douglas created a complex and multilayered narrative that kept me wanting more. What was more, the music complemented each scene so effectively that it felt like part of the movie. I'd heard such wonderful things about William Douglas' films, and watching this one really gave me a new appreciation for his artistry."|0
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt, My parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and twilight zone (new and old) couldn't do. This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.I still cannot believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did this. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone.|1
"This is a well directed Columbo episode , with also some good character but the story just does n't really  come together

Although there is some interesting dialogue and many great performances, this Columbo episode struggles to find a balance. Characters are flatly presented and while they seem integral to the mystery, none of them quite carry the necessary arc. Consequently, the climax lacks oomph as a sense of accomplishment and triumph is lost. With such talented actors involved in a typically great Columbo premise, the script needs a bit more TLC for it to truly resonate."|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I 'm Dancing '. I was so excited to get tickets to see Inside I'm Dancing and to have such an intimate experience in a theater as small as it is was icing on the cake. Once I got inside I saw why so many have heard such good things. Not only was the plot unique, but it showed its Irish roots to a tee. I could relate to the characters and the Irish-inspired set design immediately had my eyes glued to the screen.|0
Warning -- this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story  comes from was praised for their shocking scenes, but the violence and gory moments presented may leave a lasting impact on viewers of all ages.This is especially true for children, who may be left with nightmares that could cause distress.Though those old enough to watch can appreciate this amazing story, it should be approached with extreme caution and ideally without children present. Even teens might not have the maturity to make the right decisions with what they are exposed to on screen.|0
"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be ""realistic."" It is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail."|1
I was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas.|1
I'm not going to go into too much depth, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it's moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was Trey Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell.|1
The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . He is more closely connected with the Wild West Gunfighter - acting without legal authority, wreaking revenge and answering to a moral law only he understands. While not in his action capacity, Paul seeks to talk the innocent people into having a good time and develop personal connections with people around him. All these aspects make him even more lonely and extraordinary, as many seem to understand the world only in its logical perspective.|0
The Child 's Play series is n't a favourite of mine , but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay  movie. I found Bride of Chucky to be quite enjoyable compared to other movies in the Child's Play series. I appreciated the comedy injected into the movie which made it funny, as well as the plot twists, adding a sense of drama. Of course, as with all horror movies, there was suspense too, enough to keep the movie interesting throughout. To make the movie complete there were special effects, particularly from Chucky.|0
"I thought Besson 's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them  -

By conveying an array of emotions through imagery and music alone. He tells an affecting and memorable story. Through the non-linear plot, Besson captured in the perfect mixture of melancholic visuals and jovial tunes. Watching the film and tracing Besson's cinematography journey allows us to truly observe human values of hope and resiliency as Lou adapts to a changing society. After all, being heard is more important than having to express our stories in words."|0
"Due to its predictable , second-rate title , ( the one it was distributed under in Italy , at least  ) Pietro Germi'sDivorce Italian Style was undeservedly written off

It was released in Italy to tepid critical response and audiences weren't terribly enthralled either. There seemed to be an understanding at the time that a movie labeled a ""comedy of manners"" wasn't really deserving of that 'second-rate title.' Alas, had anyone bothered to watch it and recognized the irony of that title, it is sure that they would be sufficiently rewarded."|0
"""Live Together, Die Alone"" is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. So when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. It was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the past of the island & the Swan station itself and honestly moving."|1
It was a terrific movie ! I like to watch it again and again . The actors were awesome . The plot was extremely gripping and I didn't even feel like blinking till the end! The visual effects were quite remarkable. The director managed to narrate a powerful story using simple visuals and background music which really enriched the story telling experience. Watching this movie also increased my enthusiasm towards cinematic experiences and everytime I sit down to watch the same film, I find myself discovering some finer details. Overall, it was an outstanding film and I would love to watch it multiple times and cherish each time for sure!|0
"I am a long time fan of Luc Besson 's work , and for about as long as I 've  been able to recognize it , I have always loved his imagination and unique artistic sensibilities

He constantly transports us to seemingly fantastical worlds with his craft of story-telling, while reminding us to embrace different lifestyles that embrace ethics and love that exist within even the most alien landscapes. While many times have pushed boundaries, his desire to achieve pure emotion in his stories can also bring an enchanting nostalgic mood to even some of his more “family” movies."|0
Considering it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too.|1
"I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie . She was only 19  in it and her beauty and grace already carried a sense of maturity 

Despite the modest storyline and script, she conveyed emotion with exquisite timing and unparalleled artistry. From beginning to end, Turner immersed herself in her character with soul-stirring charisma. Her talent was quite un-rivalled and as I watched, my appreciation and admiration for her increased. Her character really came alive in the dynamic ballroom sequences, with those long skirts spinning and flouncing; twirling in perfect balance, juxtaposed with the power in the footwork and partnering."|0
A great movie . The movie was even better then the commercials put on . And believe it or not  the effects and details used were really really remarkable . The actors performance was perfect. Every one from the youngest kid to the oldest veteran have worked their part amazingly. The sound track used really worked on to emphasize each emotions during every moment . Story of the movie has managed to involve a moral as well as drive home some very important social messages. In summary this was one of the greatest movies that had graced the screen for some time. I highly recommend this movie for everyone!|0
"If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then do n't watch  it

If you're looking for a thrilling, suspenseful, non-stop movie night experience then this is not the film for you. Although it has plenty of action, it's the subtle nuances that really pull at you and create an indelible effect on your memory. The visuals and storyline is brought together at a gentle pace, giving enough breathing time to really consider what’s happening, making sure all points are understandable, absorbing and believable."|0
"Well, what's wrong with the title ""Separate Lies"" (accused elsewhere of not being ""exciting""). It's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi film called ""Separate Lives"", which are alluded to here.) But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. OK, it's not an ""in-your-face"" hilarious title, but then it's not an in-your-face hilarious film. Please give British films like this a chance."|1
I still ca n't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site . Such a rare  occasion where I saw a painting displayed in the actual gallery setting that I only saw through a computer before. This painting quickly became very dear to me as I felt as if it completed me, showing me I belonged somewhere. Although a touch more surreal than expected it fulfilled its own destiny. That of painting my sorrows away, of freeing me to rest in it's tranquillity. Each colour shaped a place to pause and catch my breath, calming the tense exchange between my intellect and the wildly raging emotions beneath.|0
At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you.|1
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of  Bhairavi. Director Bharatbala succeeds in captivating our attention, by compelling the journey through cinematography with precision. His artistry is enhanced by mind blowing animations and low key direction making it an enjoyable visual journey into this wondrous universe of fantasy. With clear attention to intricate details like hue and movements he succeeds in demonstrating to his audiences the complex philosophical narrative while leaving us room to delve deep in personal perspectives as well. Ultimately we come away moved by our spiritual escape which brings life to Bhairavi through divine possibilities.|0
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons , and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out . I must  say , every time an episode has a twist ending or an emotional one , I just get so hooked into the show . Recently , the series finally came out with an episode revolving around Mr.Burns. It took a full turn and presented us a very different version of the character, who had a much kinder heart than usual. I couldn’t have predicted what kind of life decisions he would make, and I was thoroughly surprised with how the episode ended.|0
"A mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. As I've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... Classic lines such as (parapharsed) ""I've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times I do it. You're a nurse, what can you give me for it?"" Nurse replies ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" Great sound track.The classic ""Hyde's got nothing to hide""."|1
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly ( 1936-59 ) . He does have a  remarkable similarity in look and personality to the real person, when Busey delivered that line from a live performance and instant a thrill surged through my heart . From his believable Texas drawl and intensely animated face when playing Buddy to a solid drummer off-beat without fail; I could understand how some movie goers had difficulty in not seeing Buddy back up and entertaining at those grand 1950s gigs. Furthermore, the individual resemblance to Buddy by Gary Busey absolutely resonated to the crowd’s enthusiam.|0
"As a film buff, I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip ""If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon""). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation."|1
Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But, other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist.|1
"Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you 'll  probably be unable

Other examples may be horror films or music videos where there is no actual plot. Music videos such as Led Zeppelin’s Stairway To Heaven show iconic images with each successive guitar riff while horror films like Evil Dead place an audience in the middle of a crazy horror flick with almost no build up or structure. Sci-fi films that build a trippy vibe such as Repo Man can transport an audience from one fantastical environment to another or completely dystopian experiences with movies such as Brazil."|0
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie, this won't be one for you. If the Truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. From a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in South Africa (and many other places).For historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as ""The Pianist,"" ""Schindler's List"" or ""Nuremberg."" Millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. This movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper."|1
No, I have not seen the original series and I won't compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species.|1
Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character , unable to speak , living in a world incompatible with modern life . He stands for all dreamers who defy their fate and seek for their rightful place. A victim of constant misunderstandings and illusions, Don Quixote clings to his outmoded ideals with courage, determination and nobility. This impassive spirit reveals the power of imagination and transforms the improbable into the real. Unconditionally accepting the humble privileges offered to him by the chaotic world he desperately desires to influence, his world is delivered by conscience.|0
The film is n't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch . Despite its flaws, the film still packs plenty of humor, making it one of the better comedies released in recent years. You can’t help but be won over by the lightheartedness and goodwill that envelops each and every character. Viewers are made to care about even the minor characters and will find plenty to smile about in its wacky story lines. It's just a joy to watch how even the silliest of concepts can be a source of endless entertainment.|0
This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few . The wise can see the wisdom  in the words and learn about things far beyond themselves. This musical shines light onto otherwise unthought-of wisdom. The musical tells of personal beliefs, hope, power and wonder which teaches valuable life lessons. In fact, it has become so renowned that some music and theatrical studies have implemented pieces of the work into their programmes to further their understanding of theatrical art.

"This film , like much of their music , is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer . It  

Although not as flashy or award-winning as its more celebrated counterparts, the film tells an incredibly simple yet thought-provoking story, with the true charm of it all the immersive soundtrack by the Beach Boys. On top of that, it demonstrates the tender nature of brotherly love and has touching moments between Carl and Brian which bring home a somber lesson. As an ensemble, they created something almost too good to be real in their family dynamite and expressive lens of subtle commentary."|0
"`` Head '' is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 . The  film follows the members of a Detroit rock band on the rise and their story as they are taken advantage of by the entertainment industry. In a timely reminder of exploitation in the entertainment industry, the members of ""Head"" have seen their careers crash, barely scraped by on money, and bandmate Dale ditches out when his loyalty is questioned. They learn some harsh life lessons but remain resilient as they dodge wrong turns and trade labels and directors."|0
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not A-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup.|1
"I love the TV contest . Hate to see it end . There are so many talented contestants . It  has been a great opportunity for them to showcase their skill and prove their mettle

Each one has tried hard, demonstrated the various qualities required to emerge successful and highlighted their qualities of resilience and will power to succeed. It has truly been amazing to watch and experience this show where all the best qualities come together and lead to success. After being a part of this competition I'm really satisfied, knowing that such great performers can find a huge platform and be appreciated for their skill."|0
"As far as I know I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now, and I would have to say this was his best ""pre-zombie"" offering. In fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died, I guess, it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch?"|1
"I 've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer , and I 'm  excited that it's finally time to see it

I went and picked up my tickets the day before, the atmosphere was abuzz with excitement. I was nearly bursting with anticipation at this point, the wait felt unbearable. Finally the doors opened, I and everyone else headed eagerly inside and I quickly picked my seat and prepared myself. The theatre lights dimmed, everyone grew silent and all that was heard was the projector as the credits started rolling."|0
WTF ! ! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending ? ? The Notebook was good ... I never seen a single Nicholas Sparks movie/book have a happy ending, his stories all have unhappy ending at some point. Despite this, fans all over the world are devoted to Sparks, I cannot deny it. I just cannot comprehend why; his romantic storylines all lack any solid footing, crumbling at the simplest misstep, typically by the man himself. His writing all blurs together, causing pain and confusion. Though everytime I watch The Notebook I forget his sad reputation.|0
Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. With World War One just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovable Tramp went to war! The film begins with the Tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant.|1
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again does a great job. And so do the other principle characters. One key charater, the physician/father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but I excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy. My wife and I really liked the film.|1
Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond. Though I'm just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient'(?) where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (as seen from the previous episodes).Anyway, this last episode is really suspended. The ending is not so understandable. I think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming.I just hope the next season will give light to more unclear/hanging events that were happened.Just can't wait further for season 3.|1
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and gorgeous. What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy. The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. I never tire of watching Fred and Ginger but Lana Turner in this movie was just as terrific. I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. She should have done more dancing and less of the Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing.|1
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film ! Hat 's off to Ben Daniels , Lavinia Currier and  all the team . It's a true inspiring movie, made with great ambition and professional care. I love how Daniels captured and exemplified our connections, universal courage, heart-breaking battles with darkness, perseverance and authenticity in every emotion shown. Daniels drew on perfect performances and camera magic of his special ones to go beyond expectations and barriers and touch deeper soulful impact. Lavinia Currier knows the storytelling , even on emotionally hard layers she illuminated brilliantly the challenging search to clarity, dreams and purity within ourselves.|0
"I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it . Since then I 've searched  everywhere for it

Since 1973, I have seen the movie numerous times. Everytime I watch it, I experience the same delight and excitement. However, finding it has been almost impossible as it wasn't available in most of the usual places such as stores, libraries or even television. Thankfully, I have been able to watch it digitally due to its remastered versions, making it readily available in streaming sites and different platforms."|0
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight.|1
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title ""The Chaplin Review"".This was an odd film in some ways because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. This film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the US efforts in WWI. It's truly odd to see Charlie as the ""super soldier"" who single-handedly captures 13 Germans, casually and coolly shoots several Germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser himself!"|1
The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency . Putney Swope is on the board for  the nomination of their next CEO. At the last minute, he slips his own name onto the ballot, is chosen unanimously and, much to the surprise of his fellow board members, reveals he has come to challenge their archaic practices. With the power of his unexpected election, Putney confronts the stodgy bureaucracy head on with no qualms about defending his position, allowing it to dictate how the office runs and also cut employee salaries and many workers begin to protest Putney.|0
I usually give horror films around 6/10 , but this one caught my eye . House of Wax was by  far the most daring horror film I have ever seen . From the scenery to the performances, I was both spooked and entertained . The twists and turns had my head spinning and it kept me invested from the first few moments . I was screaming and gripping my seat at every creepy twist . This truly was the horror movie to beat ! It’s honestly become a movie I find myself returning to time and time again.|0
"Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival . It was the opening  night feature film and one I knew would create an emotion stirring the audience

It did not disappoint! From the incredible cinematography and breathtaking location in Fiji to the exemplary direction and quality writing and performances, the story engaged and stayed with us beyond the opening night film experience. Even walking through the warmly lit corridors of the theater post-show the aura of film appreciation persisted.The film fostered friendships and kinship in me for the Fijian people that endured civil unrest only recently; indeed a very unexpected feeling from watching a piece of cinema!"|0
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days . It was not a pleasant  sight, to say the least. My heart raced with anticipation as my friends and I tuned in to each episode. But it only got worse as each week ended, the characters experiencing immense peril yet remaining unresolved. Nothing felt worse then the unmet suspense building throughout the week that never came. But I guess that's how a television series has to remain. We waited until the weekend finally arrived and brought resolution to that unresolved fate.|0
When I was 10 ( currently 14 ) , I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would  give me nightmares again. From then on, I'm much more careful and deliberate about the types of media I consume, researching the background, rating, and plot prior to viewing them. That said, I have still watched some scary movies - I have gained some courage! - but often these were made by trusted sources. Not wanting to avoid new ideas, I’ve opted to watch shows, games, and stories outside of the horror genre.|0
This movie was great . It had everything a true action fan could want . Plenty of people getting shot  , plenty of action and some incredible visuals . The star performances in this movie added to its overall appeal as well. All of the main actors had terrific performances that took the film to another level. Moreover, the villain was a major attraction for the audience. The chemistry between the star and villain was great which made for an engaging experience for everyone. From dramatic close ups to sudden twist in the plot, this movie had plenty of things going for it that made it unforgettable.|0
I can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19. I don't think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it. Nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as I had, and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by. Rent it, buy it or steal it.... a must see.|1
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live. I know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are are natives of NC. I was fortunate to see it at a local showing. At that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the movie.|1
Without going into any details of a good ... if a somewhat provocative ... TV movie , there seems to  be some distinct advantages that those type of shows offer, which I'll attempt to articulate briefly. By displaying real life conflicts that are popular within society, viewers are able to understand the given struggles within their own experiences. We don't just witness a situation unfold and hope the protagonists manage to escape their seemingly turbulent lives, but see some constructive means by which they come to term and properly handle these issues.|0
You know, people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead...and it works. Not only does it work, it works very very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. But isn't that where great comedies come from?|1
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie , Jekyll and Hyde? If you haven't seen it yet then you should, because it's awesome. All of the actors did a great job portraying their characters. Jekyll's best friend Ray (Steve Levitt) was there to help him understand what's happening to him. Chris Williams was also a good character as Doc Rudy Sussman, he played the role to perfection. Ray and Jekyll's ex-girlfriend Beverly (Julie Avery) help add even more depth to the movie.|0
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally, at the end of the 1960's decade. It was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period - and were still ongoing - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam, and the volatile movement which followed the quieter, preceding postwar 1950's.All of this and one of the funniest films, then or now.Viewing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally.|1
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. This is a haunting tale of loneliness & missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. The three leads (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising. After all the movies which devalue older women, it's wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful & sensual as well as seductive & powerful.|1
OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, I ADORE her! How innovative. I love that she has a cooking section- I admit that occasionally I skip that part, only because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. I love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. I love how personable she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her Mystery Guests.|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west .... sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie  quick jumps into ancient legend. After observing a skillful battle between two forces, the protagonist launches himself into an unexpected adventure! On this trip west the man brings together three familiar animal friends that unexpectedly join the group of now 4, destined for unimaginable heights. Stunning monsters and a collection of unexplored magical creatures set the background of a masterpiece now ready for filming. There's bound to be some sort of surreal surprise to further captivate the minds and imaginations of the watchers!|0
"I 'm not going to go into too much depth , but Showtime was a pretty funny movie . There  was a lot of sarcasm 

The main characters of the movie were Scott, David and Natalia, who provided for a good source of comic relief and played off one another quite well. Scott and David, although competitive at first, became good friends and ended up fighting side-by-side. In the end, the movie taught a powerful message of loyalty and friendship and included an abundant of laughs along the way. Each scene managed to deliver clever punches to the audience which I found refreshing and comical."|0
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I'd seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the DOP's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time.|1
"The movie is incredible , it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie . THe lines  

The movie's performances were a key factor to it's success, the actors matched perfectly to their roles, carrying the emotion and deep feeling that ran throughout the movie. I was most touched by the child performance, in which his character won over audiences by displaying kindness and integrity. The movie’s powerful music and setting fully transported me into its imaginary world. Different locations are used as diverse as deserted beach sides and awe inspiring sites with lots of foliage."|0
I loved this film, which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. I related to everything, and savored every moment. The characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. This movie shows very well the blending, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The supporting cast was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist encounters in India quite realistically.|1
"Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all, would it? Barnens ö, spelled almost like ""booné aww"" is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people, including myself.Children's Island is the title, and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's keen on breaking new records himself. In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.The story is, as most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring."|1
This Oscar-winning short film ( 40 minutes ) , based on a short story by William Faulkner , takes us  to Mississippi of 1940's. It starts out with Eula Varner who, driven by a turbulent past, attempts to force herself to become financially independent. Unfortunately, she faces obstacle after obstacle as no one gives her a fair chance in business, education or social activities. Eula quickly loses faith, until an old man gives her new advice. Eula and this old man learn valuable lessons, showing each other and us that difficult situations do not define our potential in life.|0
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent . He runs away from his parents and decides to go on  a adventure to the country. Little Gus's adventure didn't last long however as soon he was arrested by the police. When they brought him back home his parents were shocked and completely devastated at what he had done. Nonetheless, they hugged him and explained how much they cared for him, so as to understand why he acted the way he had. They were going to get him help, as he could no longer wander the streets.|0
"""A Slight Case of Murder"" is an excellent TV movie, which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress, and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite light hearted and funny, with many memorable lines (""Acting is harder than I thought- you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology"" and my personal favourite ""For next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day?"|1
I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies...She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair).|1
If you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci has done.It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone.Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest.Young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you?|1
I think this show was right on the money for me . I watched it over the plane but there  was still something so much better watching it on the big screen. The experience of watching the show in a large theatre was mesmerising. Being so close to the big screen I was able to truly experience each second as it went by. I especially appreciated the lighting, colours and tones of each scene. Everything just seemed so clear, so realistic that I was tempted to believe that I was really there experiencing the events first-hand. It made my experience more worthwhile.|0
No real plot , no character development , no Scorcese-level direction , but seriously , were you really expecting any ? It was entertaining nevertheless, due to its perfectly timed soundtracks, word plays, snappy dialogue and witty observations that left the audience giggling away. We watched and came out smiling. This one-time screening film has to offer enough delight to excuse its lack of richness. The eclectic spirit of the film plays homage to a fondly remembered indie favourite, proving again why the talk of a film sequel simply doesn’t fade away. It pays tribute to a cult classic.|0
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously . I thought it to  be one of the most thrilling pieces of cinema I have ever watched. I couldn't get the eerie, creepy atmosphere of the film out of my mind even after I got out of the theater. I was totally surprised when I found out that the story behind Blind Spot is loosely based on true events and an incident that occurred in the 1920's in Norway. This certainly made me appreciate it even more.|0
The Aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on IMDb. The songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but they weren't bad at all. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great piece of animation was O' Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.|1
This movie got better with time . I ca n't believe that it has been forty years since I saw  it for the first time! Today, I look at the same movie with an entirely different perspective. Time and experiences in life has truly enriched how I now interpret this classic. This movie was way ahead of its time when it came out and audiences found its humour innovative and cutting edge. With every viewing I can appreciate this movie more as I appreciate the tremendous effort and creativity put in to it by its creative minds.|0
Anyone who has seen Ali G before , should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali  G Indahouse'. The movie brings Ali G's blend of hip hop-styled irreverence to a movie screen full of political satire and subversive slapstick. It’s a humorous and pointed commentary on issues of race and class in British society and still manages to appeal to a broad range of ages and demographics. Packed full of bold yet lovable characters, a breakneck narrative style, hilarious vignettes and hilarious dialogue - Ali G Indahouse will be an off-the-wall viewing experience like nothing else.|0
Great movie. Post-apocalyptic films kick ass. This one is no exception. Kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval-like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey, that is, I had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence.|1
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job . He apparently  did a lot of preparation and makes all his motions very life like. The realism of the poker scene shows how devoted he was to the role. All his friends can attest to how much work Williamson put into making the scene look real and quite intense. Furthermore, he seems very comfortable in character, appearing totally natural, providing viewers a seamless narrative throughout the game. From taking shots to exclaiming witty comebacks, his convincing performance will definitely entertain the audience.|0
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time , when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original  series three or more times. As an admirer of the series I even tracked down some of the directors and actors to exchange notes on this iconic show and be amazed at its retro look. In each new viewing I marveled at the intricate concept stories, wonderful visions of alien creatures, evil empires and protagonists willing to sacrifice it all to face their fears and then not remember that they did so. It provided quite an important learning on fate, determinism, and cosmic possibility in their rather dark fashion.|0
"The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!This film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. It knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the ""Child's Play"" series. It plays up the ""stoopid humor"" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing AT it, but WITH it."|1
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary . I knew it was about  animals and that it promised a never before seen look into their world. So I prepared myself for something spectacular. But when I finally started the film I was astonished. Not only did it exceed my expectations, it captivated me and made me feel an array of emotions from sadness, to joy and from awe to utter excitement. This documentary was a truly mesmerizing journey into a whole new universe filled with beauty, warmth and strength that I'd have never experienced if I didn't give this documentary a chance.|0
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war . The rain  soaks the trenches but it cannot dampen the men’s spirits as they resolve to remain full of life while they’re away from home. Trench warfare wasn’t without laughter and much of the humour derived from ‘trench stories’ shared between the brave individuals. Despite the gruesome destruction and endless fear, Chaplin delivers much of the humour during perilous episodes. Taking risk never comes naturally but Chaplin enticed danger with humour and sly intellect.|0
That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. And the message is sad. It says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems.A great film of this wonderful Korean director.|1
Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time . It has an original  story with great comedic performances and I was laughing for almost the entire runtime. It has been praised for the smart way it balances thoughtfulness with laughs, the great cinematography and soundtrack, and most of all the ensemble of unforgettable characters. The messages on college pressures, personal responsibility, finding a path in life and following your dreams speak for themselves. Each character is dealing with these pressures, along with social acceptance.|0
probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's!|1
"Mark Blankfield (from the old late night TV show ""Fridays"")plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains."|1
"Due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in Italy, at least) I didn't expect much from this movie. Thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house (""LA CASA MALEDETTA"" means ""The cursed house""). Well, I had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different..."|1
Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't it. It plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn't really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom I didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time.|1
"I don't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. You need to get your head out of your up-tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! If this isn't your ""cup of tea"", so to speak, then look at it for what it truly is- a damn funny movie. Maybe they DID set out to make yet another drugs/T&A movie, but in this case, they've truly hit the spot. It's especially funny for the Ali G fans, because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him."|1
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that 's very reminiscent of `` The English Patient ,  '' it follows a local Puma tracker named Loretta and her unexpected bond with a local

Loretta's involvement with the wildcat initially raises hostility and distrust from her family, especially her son Timmy. The further the film progresses, the closer Loretta grows to the leopard, all the while continuing to face criticism from her family, coworkers and the nearby village. After being threatened by poachers, Loretta is inspired to use her skill to safeguard and promote awareness of her beloved leopard."|0
Jeff Garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his screen persona is hilarious; but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, performing success, and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. The supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship, and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes.|1
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers.|1
Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an  uptight accountant and a loose vagabond, respectively? Madden was drawn to the creative blend of characters, from Cage as an emotionally closed-off accountant to Cruz as a daring drifter. Through multiple discussions and rounds of auditions, it was Madden’s steady direction and admiration for the actor’s interpretive take on their respective characters that sealed the deal. Their juxtaposed personality traits generated undeniable sparks and driven from the creative prospects alone.|0
In Tweety 's S.O.S , Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that Tweety finds himself vacationing on with his new wealthy human friend, Amelia.

I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10 , and it just blew my  mind. From then on, The Outer Limits and I had an unwavering connection. While I still watched it as an adult, there was just something unique and captivating about it during childhood. In this show, horror and mystery combined with intriguing and diverse plotlines in order to tell its viewers fascinating tales, encouraging further exploration of the unknown. It’s this knowledge that I’ve carried over into my own work as a scientist today and will no doubt continue to nurture until the day I depart this universe.|0

`` Live Together , Die Alone '' is divided into three main story lines , and each one of them  has their own particular reasons for attempting to flee the island and attempt to get away. The three main characters strive to do their best to stay alive, exploring the mystery of the island, trying to use the Dharma Initiative technology to try to save the survivors, and come to terms with the force of fate.

By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local  by-election. Ali G was given a second chance by the Prime Minister, though much was made of the very audacious decision that was taken by the PM in taking a chance on the young, brazen Ali G. Nevertheless, as time passed, it soon became evident that the new candidate, hailing from Staines had a grip on his community and held great appeal amongst those who felt that they could no longer recognize politics as a vital way of social change.|0
Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and , by the process , their own lives  , these kinds of projects touch my heart. Films in which the next generation steps up to ask the questions and wants to understand the entire context and get an accurate understanding, drive home an important truth. What we did as parents, impacted our children. Whether that be postive or negative, a pattern was created in each home and this of this story is vitally important. Unspoken questions from the adult children still live today, questions the prior generations had to hope they passed on the next ones.|0
"After seeing The Aristocats : Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound , I decided  to buy it

After doing some research I was surprised to find out how well received the movie was. Even though it has been out of the spotlight for some time, many critics continue to acclaim it for its depth, lovable characters, and entertaining scenes. While rewatching the movie, I can still feel that nostalgia that grabbed me at first. There's so much joy and comfort from being reunited with O'Malley, Thomas, Berlioz, Toulouse and of course Marie!"|0
This is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. Without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only- a Sicilian farm, the boat,and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything. I wonder if this was to save money? No street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close ups. And the music...what on earth was going on with playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they were out?|1
"I saw this film at a small screening. Even though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. It's April 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their ""mid 20's"" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes."|1
"1969 was the year . New York City was the place . Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film 

to gain widespread notice in that year, a black comedy set among NYC's bohemians of the late 60s. Starring his good friend John Hatlan and Christopher Plummer as Swoope, the film developed a cult following over time for its improvisational feel. Despite minimal financial success, Putney Swoope had enormous influence in its striking use of free-form camera angles and Beat Poetry aesthetics. This gave Downey and the rest of the crew the much needed boost that set the pace for the remainder of his career."|0
A labor of love. Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. Then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. I have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. The remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and I felt I was a part of the drama unfolding before me. The casting is as perfect as one can get.|1
"Better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of ""Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex"" to the Mel Brooks of ""The Producers"", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong."|1
"The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special ""Simpson's Roasting On An Open Fire"" which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes, but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better. This episode centers around Bart who in this episode swaps on a test from Martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted, this leading to Bart mending his friendship with his Dad and losing all of his mates. The Episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out."|1
"Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in ! I love watching him ! ! i 

Every performance of his is entrancing. His natural charm, wit, and captivating gaze pull you in, leaving you wanting more. And so many roles - be it comedic or dark - that demonstrate an emotional and physical intensity and an attention to detail I truly admire. What’s especially wonderful is seeing how well the roles that incorporate physical presence of an older Langella carries. It shows a generosity and an endearment with characters he plays even at such a high age."|0
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. One can get all sorts of movies on line...old movies, new movies... but it all targets a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Maybe if enough people will write in, the copyright holder will get a clue. It's about time for this to happen. Yes, it's date, but so is The Wizard of OZ.|1
I have to offset all the terrible comments . I love this movie . I own the movie and the  soundtrack and watch it as often as I can . I think it's wonderful. I have great respect for everyone who put time and energy into creating it. I appreciate the special effects and am always in awe at how beautiful they look in a completely believable and fantastical setting. I enjoy listening to the characters’ unique and talented voices and music which all tie in together to make it one complete, remarkable piece of art.|0
This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to small-town Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decides to enlist. He gives his prize egg to his little brother, Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte.|1
I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon . I loved the film  from the moment the curtains rose. The musical score and the enchanting scenes drew me in. As I got absorbed in the musical, the performance came to an end. Even though the actors only had a short time to capture me with their magical tale, it remained etched in my memory. From then on I became a dedicated theatre enthusiast. Each performance was magical, be it a farcical play or a light opera.|0
Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums.|1
"This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I 've ever seen on film . I do  believe it deserves recognition and celebration, just like any other grand masterpiece in the realm of art and literature

I believe it is an incredible achievement and many talented people had put in an effort to create this magic. To this day, I still remain spellbound when watching the scene, like when I first watched it all those years ago. Even today I am simply mesmerised, speechless. This gem, which lies hidden amidst countless of countless other memorable works, definitely deserves more credit and love."|0
"Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner 's mansion in Paris 

The duchess's life was the life of luxury; she could roam the gardens and plazas, admire the gorgeous views of the Eiffel Tower, bask in the sun in her lavish personal residence. Her kittens were pampered too, being given the very best in gourmet cuisine, treated to spa treatments and never a moment too long without a squeak of excitement to enjoy each day. From belly rubs and belly tickles, play times with soft furry toys, curling up in deep comfort on a fluffy blanket for a siesta."|0
An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere , strikes  him. The old man fell down to the ground after being hit by the car, desperately trying to make sense of what happened. He groaned in pain and screamed in despair at the fact that he was struck while merely passing through. His heart felt shattered as he looked at the broken pieces of his beloved bicycle around him and he realized that life could be so cruel, one never knew when it would be taken away without prior notice.|0
This is a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I doubt it will make enough money. Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end.|1
Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918 , a doughboy who can not seem to get the  respect that he desires and yearns. He keeps joining the military thinking that it will grant him the respect he desires, yet he seems to only receive condescension in the battlefields, overlooked and downplayed at every turn. Eventually, he grows exasperated and soon stumbles into his own chase for validation. Taking matters into his own hands, Chaplin puts forth relentless effort and eventual achieves recognition for his fighting spirit and fearlessness, thus re-writing his story.|0
As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films I have seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other.|1
"Great movie . Post-apocalyptic films kick ass . This one is no exception . Kept up the pace and interest  the whole way through

The cinematography was breathtaking and all of the actors gave a top notch performance. Every scene provided details and colour that highlighted each character’s persona. The storytelling style managed to link and transport us through each character’s lives and ultimately create a great bond between us and them. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen as every turn gave me excitement, tragedy, hope and despair -all integral parts to a great post-apocalyptic story."|0
I thought Besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them; Capture true human emotions. The main character's struggles, triumphs, set backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most Hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical Sci-Fi labeling and become a true drama. However calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot.|1
"Very touching film, a great surprise to come up from Brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... Magical realism is a very hard task, and I believe João Falcão has made it wonderfully. It seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. Although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão has been influenced by the series ""Hoje é Dia De Maria""."|1
"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England. So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of ""separate lies"" begins to fail and then hold together again. And life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives."|1
This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies . Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish  5 stands out because it is, perhaps, the most imaginative of the lot and had an original plot - far from the monotony of simply observing vigilantism. One of the plot points also particularly resonated with viewers as the underlying moral, justice being taken into the hands of someone capable and judicious is of utmost importance for the maintenance of peace and integrity. Paul Kersey himself featured much more prominently, since it followed the angle of professional enemy clearing - going deep down into their seedy affairs, culminating in the ending scene.|0
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. After the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since Bringing Up Baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it. Not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish-fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better.|1
This was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts in a wonderful performance. His great likeability, coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him (and by extension myself, as his confidante and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended, I was so wrapped up in it.|1
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"".Le Dernier Combat is not ""Sci Fi"". It's more like Judgment. I've watched it at least a dozen times. It really is a fitting companion to Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"": ""And in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them. ""That someday, alas, may be today, in Iraq."|1
This interesting film noir features three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick, and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. Demming, as the detective, is unfortunately not nearly as good. He lacks the intelligence, strength, and cynical world view of a Bogart. Had Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic.Pace, location (a library), and atmosphere are all good. But there are a few plot holes. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless organization (Nazis) he represents. Yet after mistakenly killing Blackmer, Sanders seems to experience no anxiety or remorse.|1
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in! I love watching him!! i was 10 yrs old (1979) when i seen him for the first time.i eagerly await each and everything he'll be acting in. hopefully one day i can see him in person. he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning!!!! In my opinion he is the greatest actor iv'e ever seen!|1
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. The direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. While the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. The soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration.|1
"I went to the pre-screening of ""Rory O'Shea Was Here."" I like this movie better than I expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. It's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. Rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. Well, it is."|1
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce, Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance.|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made . The acting of Charles Buchinski ( later known as Bronson )  was mesmerizing. He portrayed his character , Jess Crossman , a life hardened cowboy with unmatched depth. The haunting setting of Old California was perfectly captured by the backdrop of swaying cottonwoods and beige hills. With a memorable song by Neil Young at the end, this is a Western classic that perfectly fits into its niche. I highly recommend that if you have yet to see this movie, take the time to do so - it'll be one of your favourites.|0
"i did not read the book . nor do i care to . the movie was a beautiful romance ,  but it failed to make a good impact on my heart 

That was partially because of how shallow the movie appeared in comparison to the original source. Without reading the book, it felt like there were aspects of the story missing that could have allowed me to fully understand the connection between the two main characters. Even with my misgivings, I could still appreciate the cinematic beauty that had been brought to the story on the silver screen."|0
"This version of ""The Lost Horizon"" is actually not a bad film at all. I think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. Sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all."|1
"I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was . I was  completely

mesmerized and ended up seeing it twice. It truly left an imprint on me, like something really special and eye-opening happened while watching. The storyline kept me in the edge of my seat from start to finish, and there were some scenes that honestly just moved me to tears. I felt my perspective broaden after viewing this movie, it changed the way I view films forever. Even weeks after viewing the film, the lasting impression was evident in the conversations I would have with friends and family."|0
"Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, clever, heady...it's hard to be articulate about something this good. There isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch- Myronex ""Putney, there's trouble in the black room!"" ""My name is Rufus."" The lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. ""Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!"""|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once, about ten years ago. I remember I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. The most important thing in this movie isn't the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie.|1
"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song, and now the terrific Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite TV shows as a kid, The A-Team. The only member he wouldn't be able to get was the late great George Peppard who played main character Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith, but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help. He did manage to reunite all members including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck #2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Capt."|1
"This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 reminds me of ""West Side Story"" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick ""Gangs of New York"" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence."|1
