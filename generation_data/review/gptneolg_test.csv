The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once, about ten years ago. I remember I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. The most important thing in this movie isn't the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie.|1
I've commented once on this Chucky great, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. The film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because I cherish Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS!!! And the gore was shockingly great! The scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful!|1
"This new installment to the Child 's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as this and this."" ""The Child 's Play movie is coming to an end and it seems to me that it is a very successful film."" ""So, let us get ready for the next movie in the series."" ""But, before that, before I introduce the Child 's Play movie, the first trailer of the Child 's Play movie."" ""But, the film is coming to an end soon and now, let us get back on to the other film."""|0
Jeff Garlin 's film is filled with heart and laughter . As in Curb Your Enthusiasm , his screen persona is a sharp-witted, quick-witted, no-nonsense reporter with an eye for comedy. He was born and raised in Boston, and moved to New York City when he was 21. After several years of odd jobs and odd jobs, Garlin got a job as a reporter for The Boston Globe, where he went on to become one of the leading sports-writers in the paper's history. The film, which is set to star Will Ferrell as his character, is based on a real life story of Garin's.|0
No, I have not seen the original series and I won't compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species.|1
This film , winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 ( tied with P.T . Anderson for his first-ever film nomination in that category ) , is a searing portrait of the Korean American immigrant community’s struggle to maintain their identity in this new country. The film is also an honest examination of the immigrant experience and the struggles that come with it, and of how the people of Korean descent are coping with the realities of living in the US. But that is not why this film takes us by surprise; it is also because of the performances of the two actors in the lead roles.|0
"Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, ""The Man"" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world."|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents.|1
A labor of love. Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. Then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. I have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. The remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and I felt I was a part of the drama unfolding before me. The casting is as perfect as one can get.|1
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White , Cinderella , or Bambi , but it IS a very beautiful animated film

I saw this movie in the theatre when I was 12 years old . I remember being really impressed with this movie . At the time , I knew nothing about animation or film . My only knowledge was that my mother used to do home movies for the radio and would take a lot of footage from our family's vacations. I was very much into the horror genre , which had not yet begun to gain a lot of mainstream attention in my home country ."|0
After seeing The Aristocats : Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound , I decided to see the full film. Well, what a surprise. As much fun as I remember this from the theater years ago, my expectations were met. Not only do I believe that The Aristocats (which I had never seen on television but was on VHS) will become one of my all-time-favorites, but I was amazed by how much fun they are. It's not a big musical, but it isn't a silent movie either.|0
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in America in the 1950s. It shows how racial tensions were brought to an extreme point by the Kennedy administration. We all know about that but there was more to this story. The film takes place during the year 1960 and shows many different characters and their thoughts about the black issue in America. One of those characters is Sam Adams, who was president of the National Urban League. He was a passionate believer in the civil rights movement when it began.|0
I know this movie is n't for everyone , and I wo n't push my opinions on you , but I will try . It is a dark film , and I wo n't recommend you see it for nothing but the story line . I have not read this book and my opinion on this book is not based on reviews from other sites . I'll admit that I haven't seen it yet, but I was curious to read about it and since it's just come out on the big screen I decided to pick it up so I could read some of it myself.|0
NOBODY ( 1999 ) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir . It 's about three salarymen who get in over their heads with a couple of women. And they don 't even know they 're in trouble . Nobody is safe . The movie is directed by the Japanese filmmaker Kiyoshi Kurosawa . He's had some big hits with movies like Seven Samurai , Kagemusha , Ringu , and Yojimbo . The film was his first film after he came back from his years in the U.S . military . He was a decorated soldier during the Second World War .|0
This is my favourite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! Peter Falk is on form as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favourite episode). The supporting cast are great especially Julie Newmar (very under-rated) and Jeanette Nolan as the house keeper that Columbo just keeps on upsetting.|1
"I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. I'm forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable.The movie is plagued by it's low budget. (One atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, ""Siskel & Ebert"".) But, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate."|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sorrows B can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate.|1
It was a terrific movie ! I like to watch it again and again . The actors were awesome . And the music was superb ! I have no words to explain how i feel about it . I love to see this movie with my wife and kids . I think its a wonderful movie . It was a great experience watching this movie again and again. I would like to wish this movie to every Indian , because i am sure that this movie has made the Indian country proud. It's the first Indian movie i ever saw.|0
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell of his days as a soldier. He has to find a way back home so he goes to the past. This game is amazing and I am enjoying it. I can see the story growing, and there are many different ways to play this. You can be a soldier, you can have a friend to go along for the ride, or you could even play the entire game all by yourself! I also think the music is amazing, and the sound effects are also pretty good.|0
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that came from it was this movie, ""Take it to Limit"" Right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. The music is probably done by rural white boys from Colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie."|1
A well written screenplay. A moving story showing the middle class English at it's best. Some great acting by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. The director, Julian Fellowes did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. It has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the English middle class.|1
As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old , I adore AristoCats . It is my passion and my life. I love my kids and my hubby and my hubby and I love our kids. So it is about this month that my son has decided he is ready for a new, bigger and better house. Well, not sure what he thinks of this but we have been talking about it for the past 2 years. We have been talking a lot about this house as of late.|0
If you haven't seen this film, do it. Its a genremix as i've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny stuff, a film noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best played orgasm on Film, bested only by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles blended together into a work of art. As an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end, at least not logical for everybody ;-). I owned an tv copy on VHS but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back.|1
Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character , unable to speak , living in a world incompatible with modern life. In order to communicate with the world Jolivet adopts an imaginary speech that he makes up in his imagination to make sense of his situation. To make it real to himself, to make sense of himself and his surroundings he makes up a speech of his own, and a speech for others who are interested. He creates his own language, and uses that language to communicate with himself, with the world around him and with people interested.|0
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film, The Life of Jimmy Dolan which starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM.|1
`` D.O.A '' is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish . Dennis Quaid is at his most charming and wily in the first half hour . Quaid spends most of this opening half trying to prove to himself and others that he is a capable reporter ( '' I'm smart enough to know I can't be the guy''). However, at one point, Quaid admits to himself '' I'm not smart enough to be in this business.'' And, by that point, it's almost been revealed that he's about to be arrested by his own agency.|0
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good. And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. The other two principals were ""decent"". But the characters themselves...what on earth was so bad about the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him behaving like the martinet Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an insufferable jerk who I was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise. Who was I kidding? Tom Wilkinson isn't Paul Bettany after all."|1
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. But it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.As Keith Richards remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day. The tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.Gary Busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.|1
Blind Spot's images are great. The action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. By the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heart-wrenching. The film score is nicely understated . Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. Hope you get a chance to see this film. It delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.|1
Who ARE the people that star in this thing? Never heard of them!! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd starts with Dr. Jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.He is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years.|1
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too.|1
"I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car ""to get stripped"" deserves whatever happens to them.The guy, Wade who ""went to a barbershop and asked for the He-Man haircut"" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. That's a little too high-maintenance for me. Also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks ""like Elton John only gayer,"" but that whole plot goes nowhere!"|1
My husband and I watched this last night...It was wonderful....For once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending. It moved along very quickly and the acting was superb.. I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway. He has never made a bad movie as far as I'm concerned. The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is awesome. We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience.|1
SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. But I laughed. A lot. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. This movie will get a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.|1
"Always enjoyed ""DOA"",1950,which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid,(Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan(Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. Dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems!"|1
No real plot , no character development , no Scorcese-level direction , but seriously , were you really expecting any of the above? And it's been ten years. It's probably time to put this episode behind you too. I don't know if I ever saw this show in any of its original format, I just saw it on DVD. It looked and felt more like a late night infomercial that had been converted to a show than anything else. There's a scene towards the beginning of the episode, where the two girls are talking about how much they hate their lives.|0
Mark Blankfield ( from the old late night TV show `` Fridays '' ) plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll , a brilliant man who is in his late 60s and suffers from Alzheimer's disease . He is the perfect man in every way except for one: he does not have a family . Jekyll suffers from Alzheimer's disease, which is very common and causes severe mental deterioration. After a series of events he is forced out into the real world and discovers that he is one of the most brilliant men on the planet. He is the only man in the universe who can bring peace to the earth.|0
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year . You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime or on the Discovery Channel. I think the general public needs to be educated a little bit about true-crime movies so we know what we’re dealing with when we come to see one of these. There are lots of movies about murders, rapes, child abuse, or other crimes that people don’t like because they don’t want to believe the victims were victimized. There are even movies about sex crimes. I want the public to be aware of what the movies are really about.|0
I really enjoyed this film , it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat . It was very well done, and I couldn't get into the film . The plot was very predictable , and I didn't think the acting was good enough . I was expecting more than I got , so maybe it was just me . I think you could have cut the story down even more, and still had something with enough suspense and thrills that the ending was good , but that would still have been a disappointing film .|0
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply . I 've been looking at the case and I am very concerned. I am not sure I understand what is going on here. They are saying that the person who made the reproduction, made the copies themselves and they are suing the people who are distributing them . You have got to ask yourself what kind of business is it to produce something and then go and sell it? Or is it different to produce something for others and then sell it too?|0
"This new installment to the Child's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing Chucky giveing him the finger and saying ""rude f--king doll"" and lots of references to the series: ""you can kill me but I'll come back. I always come back"". The movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all other films in the series. It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones."|1
This movie is beautiful in all ways . It is visually stunning , and this is a good thing since there is not much to be said about the visuals and the acting . It is the story of three young girls . They all have secrets that only each one will tell . Some secrets are hard to share with the people they love and trust the most , while others they will never tell anyone , and then there are those secrets that are even harder to tell and that is why all of them are in the movie .|0
"Without going into any details of a good...if a somewhat provocative...TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is ""no one to blame here"".I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes may be young and horny (and good looking) because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom, that doesn't mean, he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I don't buy it."|1
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918 . In fact , there is a lot less film to begin with , and there are only two of the three parts . I am sure the film would have worked better with the whole thing , but that is not the point . I am writing this for the sake of nostalgia , and not because you will enjoy the film better. I have not had the occasion to see the 1917 version of the film . It looks very good , even if you compare it with the 1919 silent version .|0
Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't it. It plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn't really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom I didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time.|1
"*Could contain spoilers, read only after seeing last episode season 2* Think about it. The guys on the north pole? Center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: ""did we miss it again?"" So there was another abnormality? Of course that was when the plain crashed! I think this whole Island is a setup. Set up by her daddy. She found out about it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for.So basically it's an Island in a magnetic shield."|1
"This film, like much of their music, is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is terrific and, in many ways, ahead of its time.The images are funny, disturbing, and at the very least, engaging. The music is amazing. This is not the ""candy pop"" sound they are unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt.HEAD, alone, should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there?"|1
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.This might sound picky, but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would YOU feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters.|1
"The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black, and the agency needs a ""token"" on the board. Swope is ignoring the meeting, reading Jet magazine at the big table, and everybody is ignoring Swope... Suddenly, the CEO croaks on the spot. No time is wasted. A janitor is called to haul off the corpse, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new CEO."|1
I thought it was brilliant! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed in looks, neither had Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as dishy! I thought that Mr T looked thinner though, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. I thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr T could'nt make the actual reunion.|1
"My husband and I watched this last night ... It was wonderful .... For once he was wrong in guessing about the movie. He said it is just a simple film but it has so many things in it. We have watched it several times now and enjoyed it tremendously. I watched this last night on TV. I think it could have been a good movie if the movie makers had not made it so ""simple"". It took away from the main point. You would not be able to get away with that if it was not for the great music and the story."|0
This is probably my favourite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! Always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show. There is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.It seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. Here are a few examples. (The episodes start again when they end - but DON'T play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. With most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.|1
"Most critics seem to have dismissed this film , like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles , as just another "" gangster picture "" or "" gangster flick."" I have been guilty of this myself, and I must confess this one was one of my favorite movies of the past year. There is very little about the movie that will shock you, and it does not seem like a typical gangster film. I would argue that the movie is more in tune with the real gangster world than many of the "" gangster films "" that followed."|0
"This movie is truly a classic 80s movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS!!!! In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! And keeping with the classic 80's ""bad guy vs good guy"" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"|1
Always enjoyed `` DOA '' ,1950 , which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film . Dennis Hopper had a great lead and the film was filmed very well with great production values. I really enjoyed watching and I wish I could revisit this film and see it again. I think this film had some great themes and it was one that had great acting and a story to tell . A great film, one of the most memorable of Dennis Hopper's entire career. Not the least remarkable of its charms was the great acting from O'Brien.|0
"Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne's ""For The Flag"" by the Czech master director Karel Zeman.Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety."|1
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house . this movie really has me in stitches from the very beginning. I love how the movie brings back so many classic horror stories. I think the reason this movie works so well is because we all know about a young boy that goes missing in the woods somewhere. we all know that this boy is going to be haunted by spirits and that he will not come back from his walk. this is where the movie really makes its mark.|0
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion, and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT.BLINDSPOT'S diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting  journey to the core of the human soul. As a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors. With superb editing, especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end. A thriller which leaves much to the minds' eye.What an  astounding accomplishment for Stephan Woloszczuk. Cheers Stephan!|1
To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. Folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. So, here's what I think:The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, however). Some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. Altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple.|1
"Separate LIES changed my life. Actually, the Q&A did.SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it:The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed Emily was ""It's Over. Dump her. Bad riddance."" For some reason, he stuck around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. At times he needed to leave. But he stuck by her and let her live her life."|1
No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as Borat. Sure, the ending drags a bit, but if Borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE, and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach.|1
**1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.Yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture.|1
I loved this film!! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw it opening night and loved it, Some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made.|1
You know, people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead...and it works. Not only does it work, it works very very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. But isn't that where great comedies come from?|1
I thought that the storyline came into place very well. I liked this movie a lot. If you're going to rag on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently somebody doesn't think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD for my room. That's how much I like it. I rather would not start an online argument with someone I don't know & have it be over a movie.|1
At one time ` Buddy Cop ' movies ruled the box office . It seemed that every summer flocks of youngsters would flood into town to experience one of the many adventures of one-eyed lawman and cop, a hero who would do things that only a good American could accomplish. And in every movie there would always be at least one character whose name would be changed from the previous year. For example: The year's title character would be a man named John, instead of a woman named Joan. Also: The hero would be a man with one eye, instead of a woman with five eyes .|0

When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling acting and bad dialogue. But it didn’t disappoint me as much as the movie was to me. I had a lot of fun. The main character, Sam, works as a security guard. He’s pretty much stuck at work all the time because the boss is too busy. And he really loves his girlfriend who is also a security guard. He gets a call from the boss telling him he has to go home.|0
"Coming from the ""druggie"" generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it I can't remember but a few things."|1
"The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special ""Simpson's Roasting On An Open Fire"" which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes, but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better. This episode centers around Bart who in this episode swaps on a test from Martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted, this leading to Bart mending his friendship with his Dad and losing all of his mates. The Episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out."|1
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. But if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you will love it. Now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. Basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. In this fight they lost the ability to speak...|1
I 've been a fan of Rachael 's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network , so I was thrilled to see that her new cookbook was finally available and available to purchase. I am so glad I decided to buy the book and I do hope it helps Rachael gain some more momentum in her pursuit of her goal of publishing her first book. Here is what I thought about the book. The book is well worth the $30 price point, but it does require some time to go through it.|0
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce shows that are on a level of quality that most people could never get away from? I can only think of a handful of shows over the last few years that I've enjoyed as much as True Detective. There are some people on this board that have some interesting thoughts. I'm glad to see that you are one of the ones. The proliferation of high quality shows has absolutely nothing to do with quality TV shows. Quality TV is a different beast.|0
Then again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. I have to alter just about everything she makes as I am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. The studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. Some people have posted that the show sucks.|1
it's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some shadowy people, and can't deal with. very, very disturbing portrayal of japan, the arbitrariness of modern life... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboilerthe spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on English sub titles. obviously, i don't know Japanese.the only other Japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa, who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre.|1
It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past.The plot wasn't great, but I really didn't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other.|1
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war . Everything about the movie was perfect . There's a wonderful chemistry between Aditya and Sreenu and their romance was so real . There are so many emotions through this story . The climax of the movie was intense and it has a very emotional scene . The cast was very professional . The film had a lot of action scenes . This was my favourite movie of the year . The story of the movie was so intriguing and the movie was well directed . I was really surprised by the plot and the characters .|0
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol ' says it all . I used to watch these when they used to have them. I love the way they are now. It's a nice change. It's a nice change on the way I was feeling. I don't want to have to watch all these boring commercials. They all start with 'I'm bored of this commercial' or they are about to show a new commercial or they are about to play a song. I hate all those annoying commercial jingles.|0
"This show really is the Broadway American Idol . It has singing , the British Guy , A guy who really is British , a really good friend of a friend of a friend of the girl in the front row , the audience who really knows what is being sung , some really great singing , good comedy , and so much love and appreciation from all involved. So please give it a listen and I would be very grateful. Thanks! Sunday, September 25, 2012

I got to meet some of the people who work on this show."|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously, its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey)once again takes to the streets (given a license to kill by the chief police no less) and moves into his friends apartment (who you guessed it) was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of getting killed.|1
"Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (both out now), but director/producer/screenwriter Robert Rodriguez is out with a brand-new film, his first-ever for homevideo, and it's one that takes its inspiration from the world of toy cars that we've all had as kids—if not the cars that our parents owned, which was probably a lot more fun. It's called Cars 3, and it's a love story for all ages, even for a car lover like Rodriguez himself—a self-professed ""mature"" adult."|0
If you 've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts , here is a Zasu zinger ! In 1933, Pitts became the first professional athlete to appear naked on stage in an American play. He became known in his hometown of Pittsburgh as the world's greatest athlete, a symbol of freedom for all people of his time. Pitts spent the first part of his life as a boxer before breaking his left leg in 1930. He moved to Miami Beach, Florida during his rehabilitation and became a professional athlete and model for the male modeling industry.|0
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island ) that keeps the viewer immersed in the world of a young couple. A lovely story of love and its consequences, a lovely movie to watch. I have already recommended it to my friends but I think everyone can see how beautiful it is. A lovely movie, full of emotions. I really loved it. I think that if you watched it on television or in the theater, it would take you 10-15 min to get through.|0
Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius . And this movie is good ! Although the film does n't nearly reach the genius , it does reach the quality that is n't bad enough to be a waste to watch. The plot is good as always, it is well structured and well written with a nice plot to go with all the characters that we follow throughout this film. Although the story is well structured, the story does not last long enough but that is only a problem if we don't want to pay attention at all, which is a problem that is n't the case here.|0
"(Some spoilers included:)Although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surreal means:""Fantastic or incongruous imagery"": One needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read James Kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, ""NO way!"""|1
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback , and if anyone is confused about her past ( like I am ) Libby is her real name . And no, we don't know when the flashbacks are happening, I was only speculating . Libby was going to ask Desmond to take her to get a divorce. Then, she was going to tell Desmond that she didn't need him or any of the other boys in order to get her out of a bad situation. And, then, she was just going to go to college, and move out of her apartment, and have her own apartment.|0
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or its director/co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also its other co-writer (and brief cameo) Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them seem to shun it, and to outsiders the movie is regarded, at best, as a curio.While the T.V. series was famously based on the antics of the Beatles' 'Help! ', this film is also judged by the same accord. Yet far from the trite and painfully overrated Beatles films, and even the dated Monkees T.V.|1
"""Live Together, Die Alone"" is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. So when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. It was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the past of the island & the Swan station itself and honestly moving."|1
"We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear of being misunderstood. A good film that shows a lot of heart. Tuesday, May 29, 2010

The director of this film has been a friend of mine for a long time and I have always respected his work and the honesty with which he portrays his subject. His work is often very real and very intimate. This film is about the friendship between a mother and daughter that have had an unusual bond. Theirs was one of those closenesses that I think everyone has, even if they have never met."|0
"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England. So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of ""separate lies"" begins to fail and then hold together again. And life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives."|1
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I'd seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the DOP's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time.|1
Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh : as the Monkees reduce their entire career to this, I can't help thinking: I'm not sure that the 1960s were as great as it sounds. It wasn't that there was no hope for the human race; it wasn't that there was no hope of happiness. But there was no hope that anyone could make a movie about what was going on, about the way people could be, if they really wanted to. In other words, there was no hope that anyone could write a good song about what we were going through.|0
I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it . It 's one of the worst films ever to hit the big screen. It is boring, boring and boring all the way. The movie is filled with dull characters, lame dialogue , lame plots , lame acting and stupid plot twists. It does not have any good performances. The acting is not as bad as expected. You can not say that they ' re not acting. Some of the lead actors are better than most actors in Hollywood. Some of their acting is better than many actors in Hollywood.|0
Spike Milligan 's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years , and 2002 's 'Puckoon ' is his only film since his heyday. We've spent time in Milligan's company for three reasons: to catch him doing something that he did, to see him play a part he did, and to play him in the only film to date that he's allowed to be a part of. This is our first trip to London to take in his home, and it turns out he's in no hurry to leave.|0
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.The film integrated excerpts of Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom.|1
This is a 100 % improvement over the dross of a third movie and it 's one hell of a movie. If you like your movies dark and twisty, you must see this one! It has a little more of a feel to it than the original but it still works well for what it is. I would recommend this one to everyone who likes a movie that is a little more intense than the norm. There's a good story in here and it's all in good fun and it's not a movie that is going to waste your time, unlike the third one.|0
"Between sweeping , extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, you’ve got everything you’d want in a movie. The film has been a box office hit and is a must see for anyone who enjoys a film in the theater or who just wants to relax and watch the latest film from a Bollywood director. Watch the trailer HERE

The movie is a romantic drama in which Ashutosh Gowariker plays the antagonist and the lead roles are played by Deepika and Ranvir Shorey respectively, with a young Anushka Sharma playing their love interest in the film."|0
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I 'm dying to re-watch it. My dad watched this movie with me when I was about five years old so that's the only one of his favorites that I don't watch. I have never seen an episode in the series that I didn't like it. As I recall, every episode has its moments that you won't see in every episode, but you can usually recognize those moments if they're in one of my favorites. In my opinion, ""The Big Chill"" was a very underrated movie."|0
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it . It is just not available in my country anymore . But I think that it is very beautiful . So, if anyone knows where I can find it, please send me the link . I'd love to have this movie . I just watched the DVD, and it really is a great movie, I loved it. But I haven't figured out how to post it to you guys. Please help me with this and I will give you the link.|0
"I love this movie a lot . I must get this on DVD . I have 2 VHS copies , 1 in my parents basement and the other on my old laptop. . The movie is good . I recommend it to people of all ages . You just have to sit through it and have patience . I loved it . I think it's one of my favorites . It's a very good movie . I recommend everyone watch it . You will like it

This movie is sooooooooooo good !!!! The story is sooooo good ."|0
Really, This movie should be released to DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio film and I was utterly pleased!!! It was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo & Juliet, and also John Gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone I thought that for the small amount I was spending it would be fine. Boy was I right.|1
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. Reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called Motorama. He has to find all eight letters in order to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. He runs into some deranged Lynch like characters. Most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that God will see it.|1
( Some spoilers included : ) Although , many commentators have called this film surreal , the term fits poorly here. This is because it is not intended to be a surreal film by anyone else’s definition . The film does not have a conscious intention of making it seem surreal . In fact , it would be difficult to call this a surreal film , if that was the intention . The film doesn’t strive to make a point with this film . It wants to be a film that makes sense by its very existence .|0
"This movie, based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I've seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's South Africa. I put it in on the scale of American History X as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the ""certain"" segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.It's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today."|1
"(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby ""B"" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to."|1
The Child's Play series isn't a favourite of mine, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre.|1
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it doesn't hold up. This glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. Just doesn't fit.|1
Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. It's all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the Queen in secret and gets Her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It's music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he'll see the Snow Queen is not so bad.|1
This film , like much of their music , is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer . It is a story about a trio of musicians , one a bass player , another a drummer , the third a pianist . The music that emanates from their soundbox is beautiful and very melodic . They have the ability to make a great live performance sound like a studio recording . I would love to hear them open for The Rolling Stones . They have toured in Europe , South America , the US , UK , Canada, Australia and New Zealand .|0
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent . He runs away from his parents and decides to go on the run . . He runs through the woods and finds a small village with only four people. They are very friendly to little Gus . He finds a woman with an eye patch who was injured by a monster. He saves her and they form a friendship . The four of them become a family and live in a cottage until Gus is old enough to leave and return to his family. The story is told in third person .|0
Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They're all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film.|1
"* Could contain spoilers , read only after seeing last episode season 2 * Think about it . The guys get a bit drunk, have sex and are on a plane when it gets sucked into a giant vortex. It's the same plane that they flew back to the future , only this time they get stuck in the past. They try to contact their friends , but they don't get any response and are then forced to crash land on the island. What's left are lots of dead bodies, some with strange alien symbols on them and a mysterious message that says ""the end is near""."|0
Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'Puckoon' is sadly no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon' of the title ). Due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint.|1
"This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 reminds me of ""West Side Story"" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick ""Gangs of New York"" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence."|1
This is a stunning movie. Raw and sublimely moving. It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences. All of the main players are mesmerising. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. Julian Fellowes has triumphed again. He's a national treasure.|1
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live. I know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are are natives of NC. I was fortunate to see it at a local showing. At that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the movie.|1
Great movie. Post-apocalyptic films kick ass. This one is no exception. Kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval-like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey, that is, I had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence.|1
"OK, so this film may not have won any Oscars, but it is not a bad film. The original ""D.O.A."" is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after ""The Right Stuff"" made him a star, and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous.This is more of an ""update"" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different."|1
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson 's work , and for about as long as I 've been alive, I've been a fanboy for his films . While there are many of these films out now , one of his masterpieces of the past few years is a very different one . The Fifth Element , as its various names have referred to it , has become something of a cult classic . It has been adapted in a number of ways in the past few years , including a successful TV show , but this was the first version of it that was shot in 3-D .|0
Ross Hunter 's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy , based on James Hilton 's enduring bestseller , was written and produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Hunter had previously written and directed the 1996 Broadway musical, which ran for more than a year on Broadway. For his new film version, he hired the original designer, Colin Stutz. He also reunited with Andrew Lloyd Webber with the score, with the original film score, music and new songs penned by Peter Allen. Also from the original Broadway production: the choreography was handled by Michael Bennett and the original book by Hilton.|0
"To say the truth , I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor . As we all know , Nicolas Cage is the guy who looks the best on camera , but we also know that the truth is he's not really that handsome to look at, what we're all talking about when he says something like, "" I wish I wasn't pretty , I wish i had a nose that would stop it from looking like this"" or "" I wish I had a chin that was a little fuller"" ."|0
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how did she end up in the same hospital Hurley was in) then you should know that despited Libby dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her.BTW, great episode. It had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions...like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four toe statue?I cannot wait till season 3, Lost just rules!!!|1
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I have seen most of her movies.I saw this for the first time on television when I was around fourteen, and I was so scared.I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much.I know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much.That just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so.I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you.|1
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to HBO, and watch this engaging biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. I recall the music, great songs that I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stud!) Then, came the end.|1
This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. I've been seeing Justin Long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, I figured with the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials not withstanding.) This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message.|1
"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted."|1
"Better than it has any right to be , this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office on Wednesday , but I have to admit, I’d rather watch the movie today. In case you need a little reminder why this movie has been so divisive , here’s why you should watch it. (Warning, this is a spoiler-y post, but I promise we’re only going to talk about spoiler-y parts here)

1. You may have seen this movie. But you may have also seen other horror movies that were released at the same time that are better."|0
When I first saw this movie , I also expected `` our boys '' to be cute , and more of a kid fantasy . I was right . What I liked about it was the way that the main character , Danny , looked like he belonged in a child's book. He was very child like and innocent looking , and as the movie went on , I thought it looked like Danny might grow up to be a great young man. That was the way the movie played , with him as an innocent young boy who has been caught up in the war .|0
What an excellent movie , made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it while doing a little digging on the net. We’d never heard or seen anything like it before. We saw it on VHS as a double-feature with Jaws, we also saw it on cable back in the late 80s, but I don’t know where we got it. I had to make a phone call, and I found it through a guy who I thought was doing a movie or TV show.|0
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film , The Life of Jimmy Dolan, directed by William Friedkin in 1968. The story is based on real-life incidents, with many similarities to the plot of Friedkin’s 1971 film The Night of the Hunter. The movie was remade in 2001 by director Kevin Reynolds, with an even more violent ending. The plot of the film involves a young boy named Jimmy Dolan (Jimmy Stewart, who would later become famous on the silver screen as Batman).|0
"I thought Besson 's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them."" He described the movie as ""not a very good piece of work"" because of its inability to communicate and the lack of characters. The film's ending is also not satisfactory. It has been considered to be the worst film in Besson's career. Besson himself has said that it was his worst work by far. Sequel
It was announced in October 2016 that Besson was developing a sequel to the film, entitled The Dictator, and that a trailer would be released by Netflix on 25 November 2016."|0
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently received no credits. Too bad.All the Dead End Kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. It is odd to watch them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents ( I guess that should be Bowery ). They even show some swimming abilities.I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. My favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film.|1
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME . . . This review is the third and final part of the two-part review posted today. In addition to the two articles, please see part 1 and part 2 . . . I must say that I am a bit confused by a few things being posted here. I have always considered myself an LOST fan, but I find myself in a bit of confusion. I am not saying that any of these posts are incorrect. I just have a lot of things to take into consideration.|0
"Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. Sayid plots a plan with Jack to surprise ""The Others"" in case Michael is double-crossing the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.This episode is one of the best of the Second Season. Unfortunately, we lovers of ""Lost"" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans."|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie. I am not saying this lightly. I love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are OK, a few I do not like at all). And, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It is light, funny, and very restful. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but I love it.|1
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war . The raincoat and trench boots come alive as the young man and woman find themselves in the midst of it. Chaplin was just twenty-two when he made his first screen test in New York on July 18, 1916, but he soon found himself in a world he had never known existed and with a job he would never have gotten if he had not been in a position to do so at the beginning. The Chaplin Studio was the largest in the country, with about ten million dollars invested.|0
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews , and I had low expectations for this movie . I was really surprised that I didn't expect the movie to be any worse than some of the other "" action movies "". I was wrong , but I was pleasantly surprised . In the end of the day, the movie is a classic . It is one of my all time favorite movies , even though I don't go see it every year . I saw this movie in 4D , which wasn't bad at all . The 4D was a great choice , and it helped in the story ."|0
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates ""Separate Lies,"" a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car."|1
"the first time I saw this movie, I just thought ""what the hell?"" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I enjoyed this movie a lot!Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a shame he stopped act. He interprets very well his character Gus on the movie.Gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!?"|1
"I was 19 or 20 , years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City , Utah and wanted to play for the University of Utah , but I had a lot to learn. I started to play guitar , but was not really good , because I didn't practice that much. I also didn't think I needed to practice. But one day I was playing at a bar with some friends , and some people overheard me play and said , ""Hey you're a pretty good musician , and you should join our band . """|0
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt , My parents loved it. I can't explain how much I enjoyed this show. It wasn't until a friend told me how much he loved this show that I discovered how great this show was. I would recommend it to everyone. The stories are so interesting and you can tell how the characters react to different situations. There are also many great stories in this show. Each episode has some type of action and most episodes have a couple of twists or a plot or two to go along with that action.|0
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Implausible scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, evil-for-no-reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hardworking citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them, only to be joined by the neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She's sweeping out the scum!|1
"1969 was the year . New York City was the place . Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to be released. This page lists all the major films that have been released in each year. The page also has links to information about the films with information about cast, crew, and plot. 1930s

My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actor's were very good.|1
What a shame this movie was never released . ( It is now playing on cable . ) I tuned into it at a time I could have easily missed it . But I would have , as it was part of the first week of the film season . While the main character of the film has a strong sense of justice , there are a few disturbing things to be seen . I thought about writing this review a few days before the film but I did not want to spoil the movie . So I am posting this review now and not in two weeks as I did with the film .|0
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 . I saw this movie a couple of times , but I never understood why it always seemed like it was about Hari , as it was not really about the character , the story was just an excuse to show her in a bikini. So , I watched this movie again and I finally get it. The movie is an interesting blend of adventure, comedy, action and some romance . It has something for everyone, both men and women .|0
Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground , and in particular the `` flowering '' of love between two people. As a drama, I enjoyed it but it is nothing like the play it pretends to be - the acting is so wooden as to be a bit silly. The characters are a bit likeable enough and their situations are quite convincing. I can see where they have been put up to it, but I do have to say they could have had more depth of character to them than they are given.|0
"Blind Spot 's images are great . The action draws you in completely , even though the movie is a lot more of a downer in the first half then it gets to end. . If you don't have to see Blind Spot , I don't know what's the point. But I do. If you don't have to see it, then why did you watch it. The movie is good, but I felt it was more like a parody of the Hollywood ""A-list"". It was pretty funny, but I would like it to have at least one more movie in it."|0
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. It is the second time I've seen it, after being very impressed by a short it did a few years back. This one was so good that, as I recall, I sat down and watched it a few dozen times during that evening, before I realized it was the same one. It's also the one I kept replaying while I was at work, after work, while I was eating dinner, when I was driving, and so on.|0
"I can not say this movie was a hilarious, but I must have had a grin on my face the entire time. I like this darker kind of comedy; ""very bad things"", ""8 heads in a duffel bag"" or ""coldblooded""The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. To me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be, but the way that ending came about was. Another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience."|1
Coming from the `` druggie '' generation , I thought this movie was hilarious . It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde back to life , and I have to say , I was pretty damn entertained . However , after a few minutes , the humor started to wear a bit thin . The movie is definitely one of those films where the laughs are over , and it is more of an emotional journey for the characters and the viewer instead of a laugh free ride . So I would recommend this movie for the first time visitor who is looking to go see one of the greatest films of all time .|0
"Let me clarify that. This is not a ""good movie"", but I am so glad it is out there, I am so glad I saw it, and for the role that it plays in my DVD collection, it is sublime. It is the ultimate PG-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on Mars. It is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable."|1
Like some people here, I love/loved Stingers! In Norway it got aired a lot later. That also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers might be the on series(except from Grey's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personallly I think she is one of the best access we have!|1
This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition.|1
"I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical ""buddy"" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show."|1
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"".Le Dernier Combat is not ""Sci Fi"". It's more like Judgment. I've watched it at least a dozen times. It really is a fitting companion to Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"": ""And in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them. ""That someday, alas, may be today, in Iraq."|1
'Captain Corelli 's Mandolin ' is a fantastic film in itself . It is nothing like the book , which I found a bit of a cheat, but I do have a fondness for Robert Zemecki, so I am grateful to him for making this film . It is certainly better than any of the other films based on it . But there are some scenes, and some characters , I cannot identify , that I would have preferred to not have been in the book . But the film's best asset is Corelli as the narrator . It is Corelli who makes the story come alive .|0
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that 's very reminiscent of `` The English Patient , which won four Oscars at the Academy Awards . The story of a leopard man and his leopard wife is told by the man . it is a great story that is very similar to a story from ""The English Patient . it is a great story . the movie ""the leopard man"" , is directed by the great John Milius , who was also director of ""The English Patient . "" it is a great story , a great movie , a great acting , a great story , a good story ."|0
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie, this won't be one for you. If the Truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. From a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in South Africa (and many other places).For historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as ""The Pianist,"" ""Schindler's List"" or ""Nuremberg."" Millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. This movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper."|1
This is a funny movie . The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but we'll see . I'm not sure if this movie deserves a sequel. I was kind of disappointed that we didn't get a full movie in this one . It just doesn't need it . It's pretty fun as it is but I think that a full movie would have pushed the plot to another place . I mean I know this is a joke but I still think we should have gotten one . The movie is pretty funny to me .|0
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children at large. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema  a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffectual police, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mentally-retarded loner etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.Unusually for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle.|1
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy ( Garlin ) wandering around Chicago with a guitar in the early ’80s and singing songs about a young woman who comes back into his life. The movie’s not perfect. It’s not that great. But it’s definitely worth seeing if you’ve never seen any of the director’s films. You’re welcome. And you can go see the movie right now. (The theater is currently showing it, but not at full price. It’s $13.95.|0
This movie felt so real . I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various ages. I felt sadness, pain, joy, love, hate, and anger for various people in the story. But mostly, I felt anger for the bad guys in the story who did nothing wrong and just wanted to get away with their actions. And then there were other people like the main character who did the right thing, and yet, I still felt a lot of anger towards them, because their actions had such a big impact on their lives.|0
If you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci has done.It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone.Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest.Young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you?|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time , when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series several times. This is the episode that I first caught on (and watched) while sitting on the front porch with my grandmother and my mother when we were first introduced to each other, watching the original Outer Limits. This is also the only one of the four I have watched without any subtitles. The original Outer Limits was an anthology television series that aired in syndication from September 1, 1962, to September 29, 1963.|0
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans chaired by a no-nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth. But the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market place and the political system demands that he conform, rendering him no different than his predecessors.|1
"`` Showtime '' falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying , and a little south of what other critics were saying , and somewhere in a world of its own and in a universe where it will never really be ""the"" big hit it's said to be. The reviews are generally good but not all of them and some are more than a little negative. If you have an issue with the movie and don't want it discussed on this website, I'm sorry . I'm a huge fan of '' and I wouldn't have wanted to have this discussion."|0
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but, Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall.|1
I am a guy , so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Geary and Robert Duvall (both of whom were awesome in this movie) were not gay. I was really surprised, though, when they got it on camera (in front of millions of people) that they were both gay, and even more surprised that it took so long for their sexuality to be revealed! And even more surprised when the revelation did happen in this movie. It's one thing to make a movie with gay sex and another to show it on film.|0
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, nasty chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.Puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much moremeaning it's my kind of film!|1
"I don't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more ""Hollywood"". James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I cannot believe this is his first real film."|1
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you 'll be able to say you've seen an old movie for free. You can watch films online in a variety of genres and watch full movies online in high definition for free of charge. The best online movie sites are those which offer a large number of films and series, but most of the films offered on the internet have very limited number of episodes to watch. There are many online movie sites available. You will have no problem in discovering movies for free.|0
where do we go from here ? that is the overriding question of this film . And make no mistake , it is a question we all should ask ourselves, if ever we are going to address it . to be sure , the movie is in no way a political tract . In fact , it would be difficult to classify it as one . But , it will be a film that will draw an audience from many political persuasions . if you are already familiar with the basic plot line , it will be easy to get through it .|0
These days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. About 95% of shows on Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network fit the listed criteria. To put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. It as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail.|1
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously , its primarily directed at a very young audience ( and yes it does have a sense of humor ) and it is not the first time this film has been directed by a man who seems to be a bit confused . It is pretty funny and entertaining , but it has some really stupid parts that are so far from the storyline of what the film is about that it is really annoying . The only thing that really matters in this film is the love story between two teenage girls that has been dragged on for three years now .|0
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International film Festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India....colorful, magical, thought provoking. Aside from one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor.|1
This little film is hysterical , full of stereotypes about gays , straights , dwarfs , British tea and pubs , then it gets weird and real with a twist ending , you can only guess at whats happening until it gets close, and it really does, and you have to see it to understand it. This is a good one to try to see before its gone, its not worth buying , it should be available for download at the time of your choosing. This is just a short film, but it gets into a lot of interesting issues, and is a lot of fun too.|0
This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to small-town Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decides to enlist. He gives his prize egg to his little brother, Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte.|1
I 'm not going to go into too much depth , but Showtime was a pretty funny movie . There is a reason i like the movie so much more than any of the others . The movie was made with a very small crew , the whole cast was under 30 , and there were very few special effects in it . I am not going to go into the details but the film is definitely a different kind of movie , more like an anthology . It's like a bunch of stories . There are three main stories in the story , each in it's own chapter .|0
This is one of my favorite films, ever. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. This is funny, creative, and always on target. This movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story.|1
"I've never seen the original ""House Of Wax"" so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, ""House Of Wax"" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here - I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch."|1
I never heard of architect , Louis Kahn , until this documentary . In this almost two hour documentary which has been the talk of many film festivals has finally been available to a wider audience on Netflix . The film is a fascinating look at his life and work and at his impact on American architecture. It starts with his beginnings as a draftsman and goes on to his rise in the world of architecture as one of the most important figures in the 20th century. To be honest i had never heard of Louis Kahn , until watching this film.|0
I love this movie, though I don't like how they picture Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch Augustin's reaction.. All in all I find it enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to reading the short story by Balzac.|1
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. As the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio.|1
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television ( RTL7 , around 1800hrs ) and I still watch a good deal of the new season when it airs. This weekend I saw that there was another episode I hadn’t seen. It is one that I’ve watched countless times. It was the fifth episode. There’s nothing special about this episode. It was the same plot as all the other ones: a new team member is in, a new challenge begins and a new competitor is eliminated. All the competitors are in the same boat and it’s all too predictable.|0
After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode ( `` Three Minutes '' ) , the survivors set out toward it to try to rescue their comrades. There were a couple of moments when they looked at each other and had a little smile, as if this was a good thing in some way. It didn't last, of course, and it didn't last for long either, but there it was for a few seconds, a kind of relief and celebration, as if a few minutes of calm had just ended a storm.|0
When I was 10 (currently 14), I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done pretty well, except for Shakespere for English class...etc...I was still only watching things that ended happy. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. After seeing this a few times over the two or so years since I first saw it, I grew to like it, especially the music.|1
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce, Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance.|1
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role.|1
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job . He apparently was a talented card player, if not too talented for poker. I've been told by someone who worked with him in the late 70's and 80's that he was quite skilled at cards. If anyone is interested I could send you some photos I took during my time working on the strip with him in the 1970's. I had a good teacher. I'll never forget the one time he took me on a wild goose chase to see what was in a house in my neighborhood.|0
"""Head"" is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968. The movie is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image. It presents the Monkees in a way their fans never perceived them; men with real thoughts. Totally controlled by their producers, the Monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film pokes fun at their image, the entertainment industry, and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It's a movie well worth seeing over and over again."|1
"Years ago I read the book ' A Máquina ' ( The machine ) . As I re-read this little book now , it has become like a part of my life and I could not wait to read it once again. So it was only a matter of days before this book became available for me to purchase on my kindle. When I received the package , I immediately opened it , and started reading . It was a book that I could not wait to read .

As with so many modern US films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.We are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. Beau Bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose.|1
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time , and this film speaks volumes about how he designed and built skyscrapers that defined cities worldwide. The story of his amazing career begins in China where, as the second youngest ever to receive a Bachelor of Architecture degree from the prestigious Beihang University in Shanghai, he decided to build his future career with his talents. He started his journey as an engineer at the China National Machinery and Electronic Industry Corporation and then went to the National University of Design and Technology (NUDT) to continue his studies of building and architectural design.|0
If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie , this wo n't be one for you . If the script is written by some writer who hasn't seen a movie in thirty years, then the movie is worthless . But if you are willing to put in thirty minutes of effort and take the time to read the script before the movie is begun, then you can find a better movie to enjoy. If the movie is as dull and uninteresting as you can possibly imagine it to be , you are doing yourself a grievous disservice . You might as well enjoy your life while you still can .|0
James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I don't think this true. Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words.|1
"Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville 's Century Theatre . A well crafted , solid drama with good support from the cast . It is the first performance of the London run of the musical "" ""The Rocky Horror Show."" . It was filmed here. . It was filmed here. This was one of the most expensive productions to be made in Britain in the 60's . The sets and costumes were done in the style of the original movie . A great success , the musical has been staged in many different countries with excellent results .

I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it . I found the idea of someone killing people because they don't want them to see what they look like grotesque. I am glad that it has been done in the past & I am glad this version is finally coming out on dvd. I will have to give it a try again in the future in the event I see it on the big screen. I would also recommend reading the novel that was made into a film. In the novel, there is not a single line about the man who was killed.|0
I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. It's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, John Garfield.Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers.|1
Oh my gosh!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so incredible......I loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult. It is my favorite Disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I watch it a ton.....It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart.|1
I ca n't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I 've described my feelings on it to people. For example, when I was a freshman in college, it was in one of my classes. I was supposed to write something for the final. As I sat down at my desk, I started to think about things I had done throughout the day and how that was going. I began to think more about things I was going to do and less about things I had already done. I thought about the day before I started the class.|0
Warning -- this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is based on is a former sex worker, whose work has appeared in the pages of the New York Times magazine and Time Magazine. I think it might be one of the better depictions of male prostitution (for women's sake, not so much the male prostitutes) ever done. The basic plot is that a beautiful, young Chinese American woman is lured into a sex trafficking ring, and is forced to sell her body to pay off debts to the gang leaders.|0
Like some people here , I love/loved Stingers ! In Norway it got aired a lot later . That also the reason why it did not got more ratings here . That means there are more kids/young people watching the movies , than adults . And this is not that surprising since I know people that watch the first movie in the series every week or every 2 weeks ! Also I know of some kids who have never seen the second one ! And I guess there will be more of them who will see it when it will get released . And I think the kids and teenagers will like it !|0
It 's Showtime ! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro 's careers . It 's not surprising that Murphy and De Niro , along with director Robert Luketic, had to work hard to get the film ready . The result is a movie that is entertaining . With a story about a young woman who becomes pregnant and then has to raise a child on her own in a very tough neighborhood , it's safe to say the actors give it the goods . The only problem is that the movie is also a little long .|0
"This movie is true action at its finest , It does n't get any better then this . This is my very first movie review , I am reviewing this film because I have watched it several times and I love it .This film will make you say "" I didn't believe it was real ""

Storyline :

It's a small country town , a new teacher is starting out at the local high school . She has to take care of her two little brothers . She doesn't have a boyfriend , her mother died when she was in elementary school ."|0
I 'm not a massive Disney fan , but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them , and I thought I'd post some of his favourites . So, here goes ! - The Little Mermaid. It was the first Disney cartoon I ever watched . When I was very young , I was in my grandma 's bedroom , and my grandad ( who was very keen on the Disney films) had been in his own bedroom for the last 20 years , and I would have been about 9 or 10 when I saw The Little Mermaid for the very first time.|0
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery 's best performances in a movie , and I have seen it twice in theaters so far, and once on home video as a part of a complete set . , but this time, she had to stretch to get to that end-of-the-road feeling that she had previously worked out for herself in a terrific scene where she goes out for a walk with her boyfriend . , and it shows in a superb performance . . . There is so much more about Elizabeth, and it is clear that she has a strong sense of who she is.|0
First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one ! I watched it in the afternoon and had to watch it again after i finished reading your review because I could not get over the perfection of it. It's just an amazing film. Second, i really love the characters and their interaction. Their relationship was so real that I could almost feel how it feels between them. They were like real friends, as if they had known each other all their lives. And third, it made me cry.|0
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, is the story of a kid named Bartleby (Justin Long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. Not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. But behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the American educational system.|1
"Yes , at times `` Unconditional Love '' overwhelms as it bounces -- no , as it ricochets -- from one to the other -- it is a wonderful and a beautiful thing -- I will always be glad for the opportunity to serve this great country and be able to be with my daughter , my friends and of course the members of the family who gave me the opportunity of serving the country. "" - - - "" I wish to thank my family and all those who have supported me and my wife throughout these past 18 years. I am proud to have served my country."|0
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid. It shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation. Jan Ellis was taught that a black man was a plague. He was raised to be that way. Then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs, Pastor Lekota. will he change his ways?. The film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another, it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy.|1
"If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost (for many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has an odd blend of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation-- even hints of slapstick, but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time, nothing has been seen like it since.I strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated, especially with Spike Lee's ""Bamboozaled"" (SP?) a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, disjointed script."|1
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen, However, I am only in the second season.The typical Columbo activities are both amusing and irritating. His cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before, And the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer--in this case cooking ,Tho the scene on the TV cooking show distracted from the main theme.Also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer. The reason was never explained ,nor did it serve any purpose.|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west....sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes from the first frame onward.A monk and his three disciples go to a town to get the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world.But an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all of the children of the town. The evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. The retainers battle the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk off for safety (The monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys).|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story , Two Soldiers is a top notch short film , a movie that takes you through the story and emotion of William Faulkner’s classic short story . The film is an adaptation of Faulkner’s story of two soldiers sent to war in different countries with the goal of killing one. They both find themselves falling in love while they are at war . It is then that we are introduced to two men who have been at war and find that they have grown apart from one another. A film in the making for over a decade, Two Soldiers is a must see film .|0
probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there 's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared , and the like .. we all know whats going on .. this is a full length movie in the most complete sense , but theres still plenty to discuss about it. ive always felt like i wanted to see this in dvd format , and here it is on blu ray. ive had this on the dvd a few weeks now , and i cant put the movie down. ive not seen anything like it in my life , and im still watching it after this long.|0
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less takes place in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer Joseph Minion's comedy, 'After Hours.' In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents.|1
"I went to the pre-screening of ""Rory O'Shea Was Here."" I like this movie better than I expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. It's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. Rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. Well, it is."|1
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards.|1
I just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were completely wasted on Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.The Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life.|1
I have to offset all the terrible comments . I love this movie . I own the movie and the DVD . The DVD was great . The movie is great . The only bad part is that there isn’t as much as there could be about this movie . All the bad comments I got about this movie are valid . And all the good parts I received were good . The movie needs a lot more than just good reviews . It needs a lot of good reviews . And it needs people talking about it .|0
To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was still in development, but still before they had decided to release it to theaters. They were still waiting to hear what the studio thought of it and what to put it on, but had decided to do the movie and not release it until it was more than a pilot. Then, in the spring of 1967 they went to Universal Studios to test for the movie, which was a test to find out what people thought would happen in the movie.|0
I've got to say it. Gary Busey saved this film. If it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. I recommend the film but just barely.The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the Holly sound?|1
This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira mistress of the dark. Another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is most glorious story ever to be told. It should sell more copies than the bible. My parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it.|1
"I just saw this film and I recommend it . It has a very good plot , it holds your attention for more than two hours . I love how the story is just a simple love story . The acting is good and all the characters are unique . It's well made and interesting . I also liked the soundtrack , it's good and I'm sure it will be a success . The plot of the film is great and interesting . The Good
The Good is that the film is good. It's a movie with a great plot and an excellent screenplay."|0
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo ' ( hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door '), an extremely well made film with a tremendous cast, and very well acted. It is the story of a young girl who moves from the small town where she was born to join her older sister, who has moved back to the family home. She wants to leave her old town, but cannot leave without first telling her parents of her reasons for going. Her mother refuses to allow it, and threatens to throw her out of the house.|0
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times . I taped it in about 1987 when it first came to DVD in the USA. I watched it again two years ago with the sound on and it really captured the feeling that the film was trying to capture, the feelings of alienation, alienation, alienation, alienation, alienation, etc . I find the acting in this film to be outstanding as well as some very funny moments . The movie really captured me on my last visit with my dad in the UK, and I've seen it three times since .|0
SPOILERS BELOW ` A Dog 's Life ' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing . In Charlie Chaplin 's version, Charlie himself is reduced to making doo-wop pop songs, which is no doubt why he can't actually sing, and he doesn't speak. It is no coincidence that The Three Stooges is his only film as a silent performer . In Chaplin's version, Darryl F. Zanuck would later change Charlie 's name to Donald O'Connor (which would remain in use through the remainder of his life ) and this film would be the last film of Chaplin to star in .|0
The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . In this one Kersey is a man who doesn’t know how to relax and is always in a hurry. In the end of the film he gets his wish and is saved from death in a car crash but that doesn’t seem to help him much. The problem with Kersey is that in his time of death, he’s a very important character and it takes a lot for him to die in a car crash.|0
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival . It was the opening film. I have to say that this was an outstanding film with great actors and very good storyline. One of my favourite films ever produced in India by the legendary Shashi Kapoor (who also co-directed it) and directed by B.R. Chhabra who also acted in the lead role. This film, which won the National award for best film is one of the few films in Indian cinema that I would want to have been made after I became famous.|0
This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.Of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home.|1
"No , I have not seen the original series and I wo n't compare the two if I had . The first time I ever watched a movie I was 9 years old I watched the original "" Star Trek "". I saw that movie at a theater in my hometown , in my own city . I went to the theater to see that movie I knew what the movie meant to me at that time . My first love of the movie was that movie . I watched the movie again when it came out and went to the theater again to watch it and I saw that movie ."|0
Years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The machine). As I re-read this little book again and again, I could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the Brazilian culture.When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.I can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text.|1
I did n't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD . I knew it had a cult following in Japan, and I was hoping for an equally cult audience here. I would have loved to see an American adaptation. I would have even been happier if there was a Japanese dub. But no matter what, this is something I'll treasure for years to come. Hiroshima, a city of more than 13 million people, was hit by the atomic bombs dropped by the United States in the final hours of the Second World War.|0
"the first time I saw this movie , I just thought `` what the hell ? '' a 10-year-old kid in a horror movie , but the movie is not that bad

I have to admit, it got better with age. To this day, I still watch this movie on a semi-regular basis, as I can't forget the creepy and spooky feeling it had. I don't remember every scene and some of them I can't even remember what they were about. I remember the opening scenes and those are the most frightening."|0
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. It provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). It's the only place that I get my tech info. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... Universe.|1
A Formula For Murder is n't a well known Giallo , but that is n't to say it 's not a highly regarded one. Released by the Italian branch of BMG , the film follows the exploits of an American businessman in a post-WW2 Italian city . The film itself is in black and white, and is quite slow moving . There are a few sequences in the film which have to be watched with the sound turned off , especially at the end of it . The acting is good , and the film would probably be well worth watching with English subtitles .|0
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history , someone had to be brave , or at least strong enough to put up a joke about it, to get laughs from the crowd. So let’s hear it for John Goodman, and his character in the movie, The Hunt for Red October. He is brave enough to joke about the events that could have taken him or his family from their home and left them in the cold, just like he does in this scene. We are in the year 2000.|0
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar returns and sets about ruining everything. Can Mitzi overcome all that's happened, even her fear of her employer's dark secret, to save herself and her brood? When it was discovered that Irena was pregnant and that her unborn child, a girl, was a clone, she would be the perfect victim: a victim who knew no fear and would not resist. But she did. Irena was the first in a line of clone slaves.|0
I never heard of architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann.|1
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age by the members of the band The Crickets. I felt as if the music I had heard for so long had ended just as it began for me. Somewhere, something is stirring in my memory and I just know it will bring with it something new and new to the world. I want to write about it as soon as I can. So, I have made a decision. It will probably be a short book of no more than 250 pages.|0
I will admit, I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, I felt like many did. I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead I was given... well, I didn't know what I was given to be honest.However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.|1
This is Christmas time ! A nativity in terms of rebirth , or at least this is what can be inferred by looking at what is presented here. The Gospel accounts tell of Christ’s birth as if it happened to a real child . We do not hear of it, so it can’t have been as ordinary as birth can be . It has to have had a deep significance . There can’t be a child with the power to do what it did. Christ is God . He must have been different . But what was He ?|0
My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever seen (we are the type of people who never read the book) and see movies we all loved and then see them a year later. The thing to remember is that we did not see the film for the first time, the first time we watched it was when we found ourselves back in the theater after two decades away. As you know, when we were growing up and watching TV, the only thing we could watch was the Disney Channel or the Cartoon Network.|0
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. If you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like Hansel and Gretel then he and his wife go home with them. The soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: ""Inspection officer -- Here!"""|1
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative.|1
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut).|1
"William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else. In short, he's what more actors should be like. ""A Slight Case of Murder"" is directed by Steven Schachter, who went on to do two more great films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap).Television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting, poor cinematography, and sub-par scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to see a TV movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for."|1
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. The most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. I don't think Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion, no matter how slight.|1
"inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius , chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which we find ourselves when it comes to the creative process in the field of film-making . he said , "" I am a film critic and as such, i must make certain distinctions about the different genres of movies and the various directors in the movie industry. the problem of art is different from the problem of artistry. the problem of making good art is different from the problem of good craftsmanship. and as a matter of fact the problem of artistry is different from the problem of acting and the problem of directing."|0
James Franco is totally cool in this movie . Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in the way only he is able to be, and to be real . . . I love this film, and I loved it so much I went to the movie and bought it and watched it twice. Then I watched it again. And then I watched it again. I love how it's such an intimate portrait of an artist, not a showman, and yet a man whose fame is very real. And in that sense, it really is like the movie I'd hoped it would be.|0
Do you liked `` Dead Man do n't wear Plaid '' ? What about `` Top Secret '' and `` Top Secret '' or `` Secret Do n't Speak '' ? You will probably enjoy `` Do n't Speak '' and `` Dead Man don't wear Plaid''. And you can get all of them from a great book called `` The Secret of the Master Code.'' The book is about the code that can open any lock in the world and get any person out in the world. You have read about it many times here. If not, read the first chapter.|0
1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and obnoxious. Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Prince's feature film career for several years.The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it is a mad farce/satire that has to be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here.|1
When the trailer for Accepted first came up , many people began to get excited about seeing it ... really excited about seeing it. It was the first big movie trailer since The Dark Knight back in 2008, and it would be followed by the next two trailers in a mere week. Now we're a week into the movie, and we have a decent sample of where things are at this stage in the campaign for Accepted to hit the big screens in a few weeks. We'll be posting the latest trailer as we watch it.|0
"Do you liked ""Dead Man don't wear Plaid""? What about ""Top Secret"" and ""A Chorus Line""? Well Müllers Büro is a fantastic Melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. Very Funny ""tongue in Cheek"" Movie Noir hommage with stunning Songs and great Dancing. You have to have a little odd humor for this movie, but it is very well worth seeing it. I've voted it a nine, If the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten. Thats how Good that Movie is."|1
"I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer, and I'm so glad now that I have. It's truly a wonderful film. The actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. I love James McAvoy in this, and I can't wait to see him in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" movie this December. Romola Garai is wonderful too. Be sure to check her out in ""I Capture the Castle"" or ""Nicholas Nickleby,"" two of my favorite films."|1
Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time . It has an original screenplay, well written characters, amazing dialogue, and the most awesome music you have ever heard . It doesn’t take itself seriously , but makes fun of itself as much as the audience . The film has everything that makes a good teen movie . The acting , the music , the humor , the editing , and of course , the humor . The story is about a gang of high school misfits . One of them is an older man who is a teacher.|0
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10, and it just blew my mind every week with each episode, every episode had a twist and each week I couldn't wait for the next. How the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, Alien and human encounters, and an insight into more of the paranormal, and how it affects the people.|1
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings , who love film , enjoy the written word , and would like to think of themselves as knowledgeable about some of life's most important issues , you might like to know that one of the things I like to talk about in my head while I am driving my car in my driveway at 3:00 am is that there is a new movie coming out this year that tells the true story of the murder of Bobby Kennedy , and will be released in theaters on August 25, 2012 .|0
This is possibly one of my favorite films. It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. However, on her birthday the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.I thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast.|1
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.This is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see it now- FANTASTIC!The acting is excellent, and Dublin plays a starring role. This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. I can't wait til it comes out on DVD.|1
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. The stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. Three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances.|1
But a great cast ! Jonathan Pryce , Kathy Bates , Rupert Everett , Lynne Redgrave , Julie Andrews and John Bird and a great supporting cast . If you haven't seen the movie by now , let me remind you that its based off a true story about two British boys who escape to France from Hitler's Germany to escape their Nazi captors , but end up fighting the fascists alongside the communists in one of history's most shocking battles , which ended up changing the way war is viewed by the British public . It was the first movie ever to win an Academy award in 3 categories .|0
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of ""The English Patient,"" even down to a scene similar to when Ralph Fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. In ""A Passion in the Desert,"" the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. Final shot will haunt me for weeks."|1
Like a few people I know, I came in late on 'Stingers'; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way I'd miss an episode. The show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'Blue Heelers', for example. The crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me.|1
"Chucky ( the murderous doll from `` Child 's Play '' and 2 crappy sequels ) is dead . But in his final moment before he was killed with a plastic bullet he tells us all that we must learn from our past so that we don ' t repeat the same mistakes in the future . how true that is! ( if you were a kid in the late 80s and early 90's you were probably the last person to get a copy of `` Child 'S Play '') 
and that was a very important moment in the movie 's life."|0
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo&Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kay is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for Mister Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay.|1
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow . It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the lead actors , the solid work of the camera and the script by John Cusack . It also had a strong soundtrack that had the fans on their feet . And of course the music itself was fantastic . The film did not live up to expectations , but with a solid supporting cast , this biopic would not be a bad idea . In the early 1990s , there was a revolution in the art of film making and television . It started with the advent of the digital technology in the late 1960s .|0
When the new Outer Limits first started, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to wind down, most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the very best, and worst, of the series.Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining to the flops.1. Afterlife: As an institution, The U.S.A. military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention plain stupid.|1
I loved this film, which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. I related to everything, and savored every moment. The characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. This movie shows very well the blending, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The supporting cast was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist encounters in India quite realistically.|1
This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies . Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 2 is an ok film, I think. But the rest is crap. It is the same shit every movie of this style. The only good thing about this movie is that it has an awesome chase sequence. I just can't explain how cool that is. There is just something about that sequence which makes it awesome. All the Death Wish movies I have seen are the same. Death Wish 1 and Death Wish 2 are pretty bad but have some good moments.|0
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons, and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out. I must admit, season one is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one.The episode begins with the family playing a game of Scrabble to get Bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he needs to. He spells out a word that angers Homer and he chases Bart around the house.|1
A very suspenseful giallo from the director of `` L'Anticristo '' ( 1974 ) , this one begins with a man being killed on a railway platform in Rome, but then he appears in the back of a taxi and goes on a journey to discover his identity. He gets to know his wife and then to discover what his wife wants, but his wife wants to kill him. The ending is not happy. This is a very suspenseful movie which does not waste the audience's patience and the audience really gets into a good story. It's great fun for a small-budget independent film.|0
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly(1936-59). He does have a spitting image to the man. Being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. I bet that Buddy Holly(Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work.|1
Containing Billy 's famous humor , this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure , pleasantly surprising and quite a romp . And it's got a heart that will give you a smile, even when things go awry , a great cast , and the kind of humor that doesn't make sense . It’s hard not to like “ Billy on the Rocks . ” At first glance the movie looks like an average summer movie, but it’s more. It’s not an average movie — the movie has a heart, the humor is offbeat, and its characters are lovable.|0
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. Nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on DVD neither on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How it's possible this could really happen??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and James Franco is hot as hell!! !Please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!!|1
This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few . The wise can see the wisdom in the songs but the rest of the world can’t see it . This musical is for the ones who don’t believe in God and the ones who can not see the wisdom in the songs of life . The wise and the unwise can not be the same . This musical has a deep meaning . The musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated only by few . This musical is not appreciated by the masses .|0
"This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is ""Amazing"" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain."|1
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously . I thought it to be a great movie, and a very enjoyable movie. I would highly recommend watching this film, it is worth the price of admission if you want to experience the story of a man who takes a chance, a chance to make a new life, and what happens after he is forced to let go of his previous life. When I first saw Blind Spot, I was a little nervous about watching it. I’m a bit of a fan of horror.|0
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman:TAS and its ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay, and Maurice LaMarche in various roles. The only qualm I had was Rob Paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending.|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard ( Beau Travail ) , Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem about love, loss, grief, and recovery. Based on Agnes Godard's memoir, the story of how her father and brother died while she was on a tour of France with her lover on a small boat in a stormy sea with only the sound of her lover's voice for company. The film, which premiered on October 12, 2015 at the Sundance Film Festival, was written, directed, and starred by Anna Faris and features an original score composed by Oscar-winning composer Danny Elfman.|0
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it . Since then I 've searched my memory to no avail trying to find it again. The film has always eluded my grasp. This film is the story of an old woman who is a great believer of her own good luck. She sees her life in a different light and decides to give all she has in an attempt to make life better for herself. When her mother dies of a heart attack, the old lady decides she will go back to school and get a degree in a field that she's passionate about.|0
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes along with the party until he realises that the war is not as simple as they say it is and that they will make a terrible mess of things and then his friend Tom is killed by the enemy.Charlie then decides that he must get involved to save the day and so begins his war with the Germans. It also has one of my favourite scenes when he shows his determination and gets ready to go out to fight them.|0
I had heard of John Garfield, but, didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue.|1
"i did not read the book . nor do i care to . the movie was a beautiful romance , i have not watched the tv show because of it . i do have the book for you . if you have not read it i am sorry . but i can't help you , you'll have to read . if you want to see it in action you might have a look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchhiking_.%28manga%29 

## Chapter Fourteen

I sat there for a while wondering if it was really over with, or if someone else could still be in the garden."|0
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is done quite well.It's twistedly cute clever & dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child.Also, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. Sure there is some Burton influence here, but I wouldn't say this Brad is trying to rip him off.He is just jumping in & adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate.|1
This movie was great . It had everything a true action fan could want . Plenty of people getting shot and killed . Good plot . A lot of fun to watch . A great plot twist at the ending . Definitely one of the best Sci-Fi action movies . A must for any action fan and movie lover . The movie was awesome. It's a very good movie that is very very action packed. It's very good movie that I am gonna watch it again . I love the action and the plot of this movie, but if I had to be honest, I do find it a bit dull.|0
"1930's comedy mystery about ""The Crooked Circle"" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them. Enjoyable but really unremarkable little film, the movie works simply because the cast headed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver dropped out of that series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (I don't hence the lack naming)."|1
SHOWTIME is a mess , but it 's an entertaining mess . The plot is forgettable , the satire is overbearing , the music is forgettable , the direction is forgettable . But in this case, all that really matters is the show 's sheer entertainment value , which is why I don't give it much thought. I just like to go watch shows where I know I'm only watching them because I'm curious about them and what they're saying -- and that's exactly how it's been for the better part of a year for me with Showtime, thanks to The Leftovers (and its spin-offs).|0
"Oh my word!! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung-ho troth world of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the moustached Bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he's feeding us with and says ""look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question: Are you enjoying this?"""|1
First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life.|1
I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. I watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what I got.|1
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow. It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads, the steadiness of the camera-work (avoiding 'rock-video' clichés that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing, and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and incidental details that are a little unnecessary, and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics.|1
This was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts in a wonderful performance. His great likeability, coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him (and by extension myself, as his confidante and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended, I was so wrapped up in it.|1
The writers of lost have outdone themselves. Season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one. Locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself, but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island? He will have to if he wants to stay alive. I don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge.|1
where do we go from here? that is the overriding question of this film. And make no mistake, 'mainly ETC. ', the 2003 effort from director john jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one.much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and I'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer.|1
My impression , having seen this documentary , is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had answers, so he eventually decided to close his eyes and leave the field to others. After watching his documentary I think there should be a ‘Kahn Effect’ so we can all learn from others mistakes. In a way, I hope Kahn has made his own contribution to the field of psychophysiology, but at a certain point he was just on his own. I have been following this case for years and I still think Kahn made a huge mistake.|0
I do n't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while my wife is at work, so why not? As it was the first movie I have ever seen, I was in a bit of a quandary before I started the movie. Not because it is a great movie but because the movie is not as bad as I expected. It is an entertaining movie with great music by Michael Giacchino. It is one of those films which I have enjoyed so much, that I have watched it at least a few times already.|0
"*May Contain Spoilers*The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was around 8 years old. Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. ""The Aristocats"" was a cute heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. In fact I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it that much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I ever saw."|1
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen , However , I am only in the mood for Columbo at this time in my life , I think I am in the age group of 70's and I remember Columbo with no problems at the time in the 70's but at the time of this show it was so horrible .. I have watched it twice and will watch it again .. I really think they did it to death and the way they put it together just didn't have any flow and made it too confusing .. I was not a big fan of it ..|0
When his elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.Although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!|1
Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for Billy Crystal. This movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid.|1
I've been a fan of Rachael's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I have seen her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen, because I saw how taken Oprah is with her, and with good reason: she comes across as very natural, and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. The set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on).|1
`` Head '' is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 . The film stars William Shatner as Captain Bill Cage , the commander in charge of a top-secret military base , where the base is run by an android named Victor Fries . There is a secret government project to build androids to be used as spies, and Cage is the one being sent in as part of the experiment. The project was set into motion when Cage's best friend and fellow officer, a girl named Karen, went missing in action, and she was believed to be killed when she was captured.|0
I don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while I did. I got so engrossed I gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. And I sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but I was crying at the end. A lot of emotional nuance. Great acting, and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.|1
I had heard of John Garfield , but , did n't know him . I loved this movie . I had heard he was a great actor . If you haven't seen the film . You won't be dissappointed . This movie has a lot of things to see . The acting is very impressive . The music is very very good . You will enjoy the movie . You will also have a great time with the movie . John Garfield has a very very bad accident in this movie . The movie is very funny . This is one of the best movies I have ever seen .|0
I do n't care what some of the reviews said , this movie was funny . The thing with this movie , it was not about a guy who was on the side of good , in this movie it was about a guy who was on the side of evil . And that's the reason why i didn't like it and i don't know why but i was very sad that i didn't give this movie a 10 . The only reason why i did give this movie 10 is because it had a great plot .|0
"A mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. As I've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... Classic lines such as (parapharsed) ""I've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times I do it. You're a nurse, what can you give me for it?"" Nurse replies ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" Great sound track.The classic ""Hyde's got nothing to hide""."|1
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage – and I’ll agree with this. It’s a strange way to go about things – I can see how you could do it to make the film feel more like part of a bigger whole – but I thought it was odd. They’re playing a live version of an acoustic version of one of their songs – in the same building they would normally use to play in. Why is it not live?|0
The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special `` Simpson 's Roasting On An Open Fire '' which had Homer and Marge sitting at their Christmas tree, trying to make sure that all the gifts were wrapped and that the presents for their kids weren't in their other pants. The Simpsons are just the most popular family on TV. And to be sure, it wasn't always this way. There was another time before Homer became a television character. It was also before he ever got a name, which is why we're not going to tell you where the Simpsons' first name came from.|0
WTF ! ! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending ? ? The Notebook was good ...but there were times when I wished he'd just finish it. Maybe if he does he'll have to give it a 5. You know why he didn't finish it? Because he didn't have time for it. He said he would have ended it had he been writing it. It really isn't about the ending. It is the themes of love and loss he is exploring at the end. It's one of his best novels.|0
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC . I 've been looking for it ever since . It was just an amazing movie . If you like crime thrillers you will enjoy this movie . I would reccomend it for a movie night with the boys or with a girlfriend . It's a crime thriller with an excellent cast . Watch it and enjoy it . It won't disappoint and will put a smile on your face for a good while after . It's not as over the top as The Untouchables but it's still an amazing film .|0
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care.|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown on the career of director Winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it's never been topped. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate.|1
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.|1
"NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p*** off three OTHER guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know, beat the living daylights out of one of our ""heroes"", the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally KILL one of the other guys!"|1
I hope , from his seat on Heaven 's comedic throne , Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this. It is also a fitting tribute to the genius who gave us The World's Greatest Comics. In many ways, this has been an eventful year for comics. Not just in terms of publishing, but even in terms of the medium itself. From DC's Black Label series to Marvel Comics' Secret Invasion to The Walking Dead series to the rise of new forms like graphic novels and autobiographies, there has been much change and much to be excited about for the medium.|0
"The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something akin to the first ""Starwars"" movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is wonderful."|1
I thought this movie was pretty good ! OK , so maybe it had a few scenes that could make it a little better or just a little more entertaining . Some of the characters were a little bit annoying but not many and the rest were really good . Overall , it was enjoyable , especially for all those fans of the book and for fans of the TV show . I will definitely give this movie a watch again when I have the chance . It's not really a movie , more of a very entertaining , well put together TV show that has a very unique feel to it .|0
"I Loved this movie . Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role . More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade with Mark Blckfield in my book . He can bring out the true emotions in people like no actor before him. A classic film that I am glad has never been redone for modern audiences

A very well made film, not too long. I liked the acting. I liked the story and I liked the acting of the women. I liked a few of them. It had great visuals and I found that I had a few of those scenes where I found myself feeling a bit uncomfortable."|0
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!!|1
Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond. Though I'm just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient'(?) where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (as seen from the previous episodes).Anyway, this last episode is really suspended. The ending is not so understandable. I think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming.I just hope the next season will give light to more unclear/hanging events that were happened.Just can't wait further for season 3.|1
I first saw The Victim ( aka Out Of Contention ) well over 25 years ago when I was very young ( and not so young ) . It's one of my all time favorite films . I really don't recall much of what happened, as I was young , and the movie was a mystery for me , so I'm not sure what happened , but I do remember the movie was about three men and one woman who were all on the same side of town . I remember it was a hard to watch film as my father was always watching movies with me .|0
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons , and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out . I must admit though, I never thought of them as a horror show , until I watched the first episode with my wife. I had to turn it off because I didn't want to be the butt of one of the jokes, so she had the remote. I turned it on again to see how bad it was before she got up. It was worse. So bad, in fact, I was surprised when I saw The Simpsons Movie.|0
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS...Hmm.... Only that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled!! You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. Everyone playing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly!|1
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie . I caught it last night on TMC . As I was browsing Netflix, I found that there was a clip of the film at the end. I did not know at first what I wanted to watch and watched the entire film, which lasted about 2 hours . I enjoyed the film immensely . I found it funny, very well made, with a lot of comedy and a twist at the end. I was so pleased with how the film ended . After it ended I asked my wife what she thought about it.|0
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is capted...the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones' own style.Chiahweson's desperate seek for inspiration and broadening his conscious led him to live the way he did, restless, outrageous, and yes very drunk! But still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect to his Master, respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection.|1
"In the first transformation scene , what is the music ? I 've heard it was `` The Greeks Do It ' ' '' which is not the case, as there are more than 1 music. There is a music in the scene but there is a music that is not there

When you are at the temple scene, the music you are hearing sounds like a piano. You hear the piano at the temple and it is followed by singing. I think it was a choir. The music in the temple scene is very slow."|0
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years . On the contrary , I found it very enjoyable and very funny at the same time . I liked how much it was based on real events and how true the characters of the film were . I really liked the movie . Thank you for such a great effort . It’s a movie that should be watched again . This time around I found it a little bit more entertaining . The actors were very good and did a nice job . It is very entertaining and funny .|0
"Mark Blankfield (from the old late night TV show ""Fridays"")plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains."|1
That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. And the message is sad. It says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems.A great film of this wonderful Korean director.|1
This is one of my favourite Disney films . It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: humour, a good message, great songs (I love the theme song!) and fantastic visuals. When my kids were babies and toddlers they watched this film so many times and I knew it was the perfect film to introduce them to. The only problem is that my kids couldn't get past a certain scene in the forest where the princess is singing the lullaby of the trees. They cried and wanted to go home.|0
Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. With World War One just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovable Tramp went to war! The film begins with the Tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant.|1
When the new Outer Limits first started , the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging . As the series began to decline , the more pessimistic episodes have started to make the series a lot worse . The latest episode is so bad that the producers are now threatening to cancel Outer Limits . It's not clear yet if the new episodes are the ones that are even worse or if this is the first time they have shown the series since it's beginning . In any case this is a show that I would not watch if I were you. Here is why.|0
"""A Slight Case of Murder"" is an excellent TV movie, which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress, and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite light hearted and funny, with many memorable lines (""Acting is harder than I thought- you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology"" and my personal favourite ""For next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day?"|1
I just ca n't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense . It was never supposed to be like this. All I know is that if I had the money to make this movie I'd try to take it back to the beginning and redo it all in 3d instead of going for what it does best . I think it is the most fun movie that I've ever seen. The graphics are amazing, it has great music and the plot is fun . I don't understand why people think this was ever meant to be good or great .|0
I still ca n't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site . Such a rare thing to happen and I don't think I've ever seen someone receive something in the mail so soon. But to have a package in the mail at this time in my life is something I have never experienced. I was so happy to get this. I'll be sending you my favorite picture of my cats. Thanks for everything and I love you guys very much. Thanks for your kind and thoughtful comments. I really appreciate the thought you put into writing your letter to us.|0
Being a middle aged mom myself , I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in a young adult. The two main characters of this story were very attractive in my opinion . The story's storyline was quite interesting with its twists , turns and heartbreaks . It's kind of like the Hunger Games in many ways . The ending was very satisfying and it felt as if the whole journey was worth waiting for . I have to say though, I had a few quibbles with a few of the characters . The main two in this novel were the main character and the author's daughter .|0
William H. Macy always gives a good performance . He never looks lazy and never seems like he 'd rather be somewhere else.' He is always well dressed, his suits always clean, and his hair always combed and perfectly coiffured. Burt Reynolds always looks like he has a lot to say. He always tells the same joke, or tells the same story. He's always wearing the same old clothes that he probably wore last week. Steve McQueen always looks impeccable. Every day he is a little bit better looking. He always looks a little bit better than you.|0
This is a brilliant film . The story starts off in Romania , where Billy Crystal stars as an agent sent out to collect a spy who has been working for the Russian Federation for over 30 years . The Russians have managed to hide out in this country for decades , in the hopes that no one would find them and bring them to trial . The movie then travels across Europe, to Britain , and back to Romania. Billy then finds himself in a different country , and is tasked with collecting a spy who is working for the KGB .|0
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars ( The Monkees and Victor Mature ) , but for everyone who was rooting for them and supporting them when the time came. However, we’ve never really seen what it felt like to be in a movie where we, the viewers, get to be the stars. That was the whole idea behind the film, but there’s a part of me that has to be disappointed because, for a lot of people, a movie like that would have been the only reason they were ever in a cinema.|0
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. This is a haunting tale of loneliness & missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. The three leads (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising. After all the movies which devalue older women, it's wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful & sensual as well as seductive & powerful.|1
"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I've seen my share. To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie.Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, Fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect."|1
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father, Louis Kahn, dead since 1974. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work.|1
I can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19. I don't think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it. Nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as I had, and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by. Rent it, buy it or steal it.... a must see.|1
What a surprise this film was . I 've seen a good few of Fulci 's horror and zombie flicks but this was his first film to make my blood run cold. There 's nothing subtle about the film and it was brutal . Fulci 's style of film-making made my hair stand on end and his special effects are as scary as a horror flick can be. Fulci was born in Italy in 1937 and went on to have an extensive career as a director and film-maker . He specialised in making zombie films with a twist of humour . There 's a lot more to this film but to sum it up .|0
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'The Godfather of Gore'. While Don't Torture a Duckling was made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn't all that gory; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made! Don't Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this Giallo is great.|1
I 've got to say it . Gary Busey saved this film . If it were not for his fine acting I'm not sure I could have stood it . This is the one movie that I feel that every movie fan will agree on . I have seen this movie over and over and I can't even begin to explain why it is the one I like so much ! It is one of my favs . I thought that this movie is going to suck but the ending made it a good movie . I can't believe how good it is and how great is Gary Busey !|0
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads. The movie is about Bartelby .B. Gaines a guy who has rejected from all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it, problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and I have always watched it since. Overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up.|1
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I just rewatched it last night, I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres.|1
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO type channels. I missed the beginning but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you get the chance take the time to watch it. Every once in a while I think about having the cable company take off my Movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them.|1
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt but became separated from his unit. After nearly starving and/or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy. It brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal. All things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter.|1
"I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former TV cop, brought in by Russo's character to coach the cops on how to be ""TV cops."" Those are by far the funniest scenes."|1
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but does so with a wry humour. This is a really entertaining film and I can't wait for the next installment in this series. I highly recommend this film! This was a very enjoyable film that kept my attention for a very long time, which is something it's never been said that I have. There's a lot of information about the world of black metal but this film focuses on one band in particular and what they are doing.|0
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.T Dutchess and the kittens love music.They have to practice the piano everyday.But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and her kittens he tries to make them sleep. But he fails. Them Dutchess meets a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats break into song. With the song everybody wants to be a cat. Thomas gets to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other.I loved this movie and i like the cats to!|1
"If we could have `` Separate Tables , '' why not `` Separate Lies . `` This becomes somewhat involved. Separate tables may seem like a good idea, especially if you're the author of the source material. But there are a few issues we need to discuss:

    * The tables must be self-contained. You can't expect users to download a whole book and then expect it to be useful. * It's a waste of disk space if you put all the tables into the same file, even if there's a single index that can be used by all of the tables."|0
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time . Quickly the movie grabbed me and I was sucked into the plot . I was in for a roller coaster ride for the first 15 mins or so , it was a good ride and then the movie just died down . I guess the movie is going to get a 5 star and I hope I have not been spoiled too much . I would highly recommend this movie for people to watch it . It was good and it had a lot of action and mystery .|0
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen . Clearly not that many because it only took in $25,000 at last count. But it is available on VOD , so you should check that out . The film stars Michael Cera, Kristen Wiig, Jason Segel , and Owen Wilson . The movie is directed by David Lowery who is also the co-producer and co-writer. It is a story of three friends who move to Los Angeles to become actors. They all meet while doing stand up at the local theater . The film is a great parody of what happens to actors after their big break .|0
The Monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. Yes, they might have been the original manufactured rock band; a gimmick that certainly has reached overkill in the 21st century. However, their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, (I'm Not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters such as Boyce/Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen/King and John Stewart.|1
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. We get the laugh when Columbo makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery.This is another good Columbo-episode, and I will rate it 7/10.|1
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap, for one thing!|1
"To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. Their inventive and comedic series (sort of an American Idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.This is their take on their ""manufactured image"" and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.It is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.See it with an open mind."|1
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally , at the end of the 1960 's. In the early 1980 's it was the latest thing, and then it lost a little of that magic, or at least some of that sense of magic. And then it lost even that little bit , and now it's gone from being a wonderful film to an average looking film , with not much of an appeal for anyone but those that had the chance to see it back in the ' 60's .|0
Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But, other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist.|1
Well , what 's wrong with the title `` Separate Lies '' ( accused elsewhere of not being `` exciting '') ? You should be able to read a newspaper, or read a comic book with any degree of understanding. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with a comic book or the newspaper. The only real problem is if what you have read was not there by design , but is there in an attempt by the publisher ( or editor ) to sell something to you, and it is not what you want to read. I don't see what you can possibly find to complain about with that.|0
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. Filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. Starting with both ""Breathless"" and underground American cinema (such as Kenneth Anger), films became more and more experimental. All of this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with ""Easy Rider"". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially."|1
Great show ! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps . Contestants range in ages from 19 to 52 years old and all have been competing for some time. There will be a couple of contestants on the lower end of the age bracket, so I think that the producers of the show will choose a winner that most reflects the demographics of the country they are competing in. It will be an interesting show and if the winner is good enough it could help them in their career as TV personalities and maybe even in politics. This is so exciting !|0
The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency . Putney Swope is on the board for three reasons. First, he can afford to pay the rent. He makes the board meetings interesting with his dry wit and colorful comments. Second, he has to keep up appearances. So he makes the meetings interesting with his colorful comments. Third, he is the only member who understands the importance of the agency. This is why he keeps up the appearance that he understands the importance of the agency. And so, the meetings are interesting.|0
Oh my word ! ! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or even any artistic value. I have no problem about the violence in it (it's hard to watch but the film works), or the sex (I don't even mind it's there) but I do not know what to do with a film that tells us that war is bad and not very good at all. Not only is the message that there is nothing better in life then being in war, and there is absolutely nothing worse than being in war.|0
I saw this film at a small screening . Even though it had a low budget , the creative direction and the acting did not let the movie down . I do agree that the ending was not satisfying but a movie like this has no end , it is just a journey . Also , i was shocked by how well this movie was received by the Indian critics . B.Bose is a director who does not believe in making movies that are just entertainers , he is always looking for something more . While this is true , i am still surprised that he was able to put a great script together .|0
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it (typical Malibu Barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! I watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just a ace actor. Total hero man. The main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax!|1
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love , passion , and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in this powerful drama that won a Special Jury Prize at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. Told from the point of view of a brother whose mother died from cancer, and his younger half-brother who was left behind with her, the film is a deeply personal portrait of the human cost of death. A film that will inspire and challenge you to confront the darkness in our own hearts, and remind you of the importance of forgiveness.|0
I thought this movie was pretty good!OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major Chad Michael Murray fan, but because i enjoyed it.|1
"""Showtime"" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As ""real life"" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but DUH--- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and overdone."|1
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre , but I think this one is done quite good so far , I am not one of those critics who likes to review everything and I would say this one does have a lot of redeeming features that I will not talk about here . So , the plot of this comic is actually pretty simple . It is set in the time of World War Two when the Nazi's were on the offensive . They were going to try and invade the Soviet Union . This is where things get complicated because the Russians were fighting a very different sort of war back then .|0
This is a stunning movie . Raw and sublimely moving . It felt like a very gripping , intelligent stage drama . The characters and story were masterful . This is one of the better films I have watched in a while. The characters were all believable, and I found myself quite attached to them . I'm sure many will find themselves attached to them too . The setting is also very beautiful . I feel this was very well-written and acted . This is one of those movies where the story, character development and acting can't be improved upon .|0
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I doubt it!Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie off of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever.Of course.|1
probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's!|1
`` Caribe '' is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects . However , it delivers a perfectly balanced blend of good-natured humor with an occasional heart-racing moment as it depicts the various stages of an intense game of life and death, from the beginning, through the middle and into the end of the game . . . and possibly beyond. It's a very good game, really, a very good title. It's a fun, lighthearted adventure game with very good writing, a great soundtrack and very nice graphics. The problem I have with it though is that I feel it's a very short game.|0
This is my favourite Columbo . Martin Landau ( excellent ! ) plays twins , one of whom may have been murdered, the other is suspected. The murder of the twin causes the other to go insane, the man in the street gets involved and the police try to clear Martin Landau. Columbo is excellent, he is the perfect character for a detective novel. I read the first book and was hooked. I have been looking for a new book to read. This is my favourite. A real page turner and very very good read. I am so pleased I have read this.|0
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from ""Ed"" and the new Apple computer ads."|1
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again does a great job. And so do the other principle characters. One key charater, the physician/father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but I excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy. My wife and I really liked the film.|1
What's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... Here is my forecast: 1. The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. Buts lets see about that. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3.|1
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy, so I am somewhat biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the film is amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, to see 200 ton Blue Whales 'cruising' through the Sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines.|1
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love of Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life. Jang Seung-up is one of the (maybe the most) famous Korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. Given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature, it is amazing that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill.|1
As a film buff , I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny , sarcastic comments about this one. I saw the film last year with a group of friends on a Tuesday evening, and then saw the same movie again with my brother on a Sunday night, and we both loved this movie as a whole! I don’t think I’d see it again, even as a big family movie because the characters were so well crafted . But it was definitely worth seeing all the time and I loved it a lot as I watched it again and again.|0
I can not say this movie was a hilarious , but I must have had a grin on my face throughout it . This movie had everything and a bit more and that was what I liked most . From the start, it is clear what a bad movie this movie had been . The first 20 minutes is not that bad, but by the end it has been ruined . There were many funny scenes , but the ones that makes me smile was the ending . It could have made a good comedy, but I just thought that it could be a drama .|0
"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be ""realistic."" It is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail."|1
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already gone through so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very glad now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie.I won't give a synopsis of the plot, because other reviewers have already done that. But I will say that I don't understand comments that it's bleak, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic.|1
"A well written screenplay . A moving story showing the middle class English at it 's best . Some great performances and a good mix of humour and horror . I found this book interesting from the beginning and enjoyed every page . A well written and an entertaining book . A must read book for everyone . A very enjoyable read . I recomend this book to everyone who likes to read about different things . ""This is the story of two young girls who both had to move to a new house and move into it with a new set of people with their new family."|0
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious . Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull on the shield was awesome . The cartoon was really nice and I recommend this to everyone . I was really amazed with this cartoon because I thought that it was not for me because of the bad voice acting but it was really great and the animation was good . I will definately watch this again and again . I also added this to my youtube favorites . It was a really great animation . I hope that this will become more popular because it is so awesome .|0
I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didn't give Me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through.|1
"Is this a good movie? It's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when ""the old gentleman"" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.Yes, what lurks in the Maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact."|1
"This is one of the best of the early ""Star Trek"" episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the ""Star Trek"" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin."|1
Just as in `` Columbo '' we see the fatality occur right at the beginning . What follows is an amazing tale of an encounter with death that occurs almost from the beginning . the man is walking on a beach . . . but he is not just a beach walker. He is one who knows something that might be called a 'secret'. What that something is we won't know until later on . . . this man's name is Tom Hanks. He appears in a number of films. One of these is 2001: A Space Odyssey .|0
"Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. He spends time ""over there"" in World War One trenches. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. The cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. Chaplin ends up capturing several German soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them."|1
The show start out with the boat. Desmond was i it. Then they went to try to save Walt. And Lock things that the button pushing is a big joke at the same time Desmond found out that hes the one that crashed the plane. Eko tries to open the door that Jhon locked on him, and Charlie helped him find the Bomb. While Sayid and Jack plan is that, Sasyid is to find the others first and see who and what the other are. And find if there armed and have any weapons. Micheal takes Jack, Swayer, Kate, and Hugo in a trap.|1
I wish there were more films about middle aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. Amy Watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce.|1
What an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. Why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing.|1
"`` I am ... proud of 'Head ' , '' Mike Nesmith has said . He should be , because his voice and performance as a solo performer and with The Nesmith Brothers made a lot of people go a long way to look for something they could not find on radio and in clubs. "" I am ... Proud to be here , ''he said. ''Mike Nesmith has a huge influence on the entire country in the '60s. He played guitar like a true artist. He made me think that if the guitar could move you, you could move the guitar."|0
It 's just that . Chucky 1 was good . Chucky 2 was better . Chucky 3 sucked . Now I can't even get back into the series . At least it's better than the first one . I don't even know what to talk about these movies . They don't even try anymore . And the last movie was a joke . You could have just killed the motherfucker . I have no idea what the point was . Like they're going through the motions again instead of really doing anything new . And if the first one was a comedy it was so bad it's hilarious .|0
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets up with them and offers to help them.|1
The Child 's Play series is n't a favourite of mine , but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay film. This is not really my taste but I enjoyed Bride Of Chucky for what it was and that’s all you can expect from it in this list of bad films. Now, I must say that the Child’s Play series had some great films. They all had a good script, a great director, excellent actors and some decent horror sequences too. But what I am trying to say is that the series was bad.|0
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important hostile alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh.|1
A great movie . The movie was even better then the commercials put on . And believe it or not , it has one of the best trailers in the history of the movie industry . The movie is about to come out soon , but not yet on DVD . The movie is good but not great . I’ll give it two out of five and a half. . I think it is better to call this a great movie but not one of the greats . It is entertaining and has a lot of good things .|0
This is a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I doubt it will make enough money. Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end.|1
This film is an impressionistic , poetic take on the immigrant experience , a reflective look at the turmoil and struggle that immigrants experience in America. A woman who is an immigrant and struggling to live in America struggles to find her place in this society. She is a single mother with three children. This is an immigrant story of her life, her experiences and her search to find out what makes her happy. This film is not a documentary on her life, but her life in this film is an attempt to show what she was trying to find out.|0
After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it just about succeeds.The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak.|1
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still I enjoyed it. This time, Charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them. Death Wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and I enjoyed it every single second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page providing the music, with producers Golan and Globus still doing there thing and Charles Bronson is still acting good for Paul Kersey.|1
This is sweet . The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira's daughter . My guess is they are going to remake this movie in Chinese . There are already two versions. One version in Chinese , and one in English . And this one is translated into Chinese , which means they will probably put it out there . I hope it's gonna be a good remake , cause this is a good movie . It's original too . The new trailer for this movie looks great! The trailer features a lot of CGI effects that are very eye-catching!|0
An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere , strikes him in the chest, and smashes into the side of his bike. The impact forces the old man forward, and his bike plummets down a steep embankment . The old man has only a few moments to survive the crash before he finds out that he is the father of a young child. The car's driver has been arrested and will be spending the rest of his life in prison, but can he be sent to jail as well?|0
There 's no point in comparing this with the original series . Though different in look and content , both are set within the universe of the same name . As is the tradition with any new series , it makes sense to look back at some of the earlier works . This is especially true when it's done with the help of a new film , which is exactly what this film is . It all started with this year's release of the first feature-length film in the Star Wars franchise , which had some of the most memorable characters and memorable scenes in all the films .|0
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky ' is a `` return to greatness '' but the series was never really a great show. There were some good episodes in it. The only real reason to watch it is when someone asks you if they can buy one for their children. I've seen one. __________________

This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. They think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in New York to send for their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown Russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line.|1
There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something `` not human '' is portraying human beings and their feelings in an entertaining way. For me, there is a film that has that quality, a movie with the same name that I saw when I was 7 years old. The movie was a cartoon called `` The Wobbly Wabbit '' that my father would make up. My dad is a man of his words and I remember him being upset because I wouldn't go see the movie for months. I was a young kid who didn't understand why I couldn't go out and see the movie.|0
This was a riveting film , one that really drew me in . I 'm a big fan of William H. Macy's , and this is not his best work , but if you've seen this or any other of his acting , this is not one of his very best . But , as an actor , it's not his strongest performance . But Macy is still a great actor , so , I had high expectations for this . I loved it . And , as I watched him in this , I realized that there was something I loved about this .|0
Some days ago , in Rome , a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a foreign tourist, with the support of the local police, and the full complicity of the Italian State. The young man had been released by the police a few days before the incident. They knew he would repeat his behaviour if they would not let him go home. A few hours after he was released, he left his flat and began walking in search of some companions to have fun on his own in the neighbourhood.|0
"First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one! I watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say ""This sucks people cant fly!"" to them i say IT'S FICTION and that it is. This is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a ""fairytale"". And a very pleasant to watch Asian fairytale. The image's can actually blow your mind. Because there so artistically filmed , Ang Lee has a very (unapreciated u might say) big talent."|1
It 's up there with Where 's Poppa , The Groove Tube , Putney Swope . It memorializes the NYPL at its finest and it serves the same purpose as a museum does . If there is anything to say on the matter than the NYPL has the best collection in America and its on par with the best . I don 't need a museum to be inspired by , I can read a book at my desk and draw my own conclusions about the art which I find on my shelves , I can see art in museums and books .|0
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever , Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense , with enough action and twists to keep us guessing until the very end. It is rare in these days to find a show that keeps its viewers guessing until the last moment , with each twist leading us to the final reveal. The end result is not a one-shot story , with each twist giving us more and more questions to think about. But I am glad that this show was able to achieve such a result, especially with a story as complicated as this one.|0
"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety , my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of cinematic art are better appreciated than understood. I'm not trying to suggest that this movie was poorly made, or that it wasn't worth watching; it is just that, like a novel or a play , you can read a book or attend a play and never fully understand the work. I am trying to understand this particular film, not explain why it is ""good"". And I don't understand it well enough yet to make that claim, but I have been impressed."|0
But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning.I'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not Medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic.|1
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements which can make good TV drama: a good script, solid cast, good production values.The episodes have good direction, acting, music. The story is simple but effective. The series’ theme is good, the way the series uses it. There is a moral which comes out from the episode but the moral is more than just that. There is a scene which takes place after the episode has ended and in it Columbo is talking to a reporter.|0
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy , and the Sea has always intrigued me. However when it comes to designing a boat I have never really tried. So here is my attempt to design a Sea that would give you the experience of sailing the Pacific. I will do my best to provide as much detail as possible, with as much feedback as possible after I sail it. This is my first design and I do not intend to make a regular living at it, or sell any of my work.|0

Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie ( I have lived here my whole life) I just knew it was going to turn out very different from what we were expecting. The first time I saw “A Trip to Beyond”, I was a little shocked by how it turned out but once I saw this picture, it just confirmed my suspicions. It’s like they shot this movie in slow motion. I can just imagine that scene with the camera moving slowly from one place to another, the whole time the camera panned over the ocean.|0
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences, its not like its the usual done and tried path. the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing. Justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech.|1
Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne 's `` For The Flag '' by the Czech master director Karel Zeman. The story is about a young boy in the year 1872 who becomes a flag carrier of the Czech Republic's first independence movement after the battle of Koper against Austria in 1848 and becomes the flag-bearer for the new nation in Prague in the capital of the Czech lands and later moves on to St. Petersburg. Zeman was the first foreign director to shoot a film in Russia after the collapse of the old system in the 1920s.|0
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. The humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.Personally I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour.|1
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance , a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - this is one film I will never be able to put out of mind. It was an emotional rollercoaster from beginning to end but I am so glad I went through it. The acting is brilliant and the film has a wonderful sense of humour and is a heart-breaker in the best way. I am not sure why I was given this book, I know I bought it because I was recommended it by someone. So what is so special about it?|0
The best thing from the American Pie `` bakery . '' I found the humor and the plot to be great, and the action well done. The acting was fine, and I really enjoyed it. I hope the movie will be made into a television series. There were a few plot holes I thought should have been explained better. 1. What was the cause of his heart attack? Why wasn't his mother or his daughter at his side when he died? What really happened on the plane? Was the pilot trying to save his life?|0
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse.|1
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel , I have to say, I was not really impressed with this kind of game. It was a shame, as a little more attention to detail would bring out all the hidden gems of this series. The idea of the game is simple: you have to shoot the enemies. There is a little bit of variety to the enemies, and if you pay attention, you will see how they are placed so that they would be able to cover the areas that need to be secured.|0
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard-pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time-capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time,space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could.HEAD is a reflection of those films. No matter how one feels about the Monkees, this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium.|1
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The movie's highlights are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings such energy to the performances that Holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to stardom and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash.|1
"What 's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season ... Here we go again... I guess I could go for a few beers and share my theories on the next season... Or maybe just a quiet night in, with the door closed. There's so much to discuss, so little time, so let's get started on this journey. Here are the five things I want to touch upon in the upcoming seasons, what I think is most important for the show to do differently and what I would recommend to Season 6:

In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling. He’s not afraid of hard subjects like violence or drugs. But he also has a sense of humor, as he did in Blood and Black Lace, a film that’s become a classic in the horror genre and was recently released in a remastering of its original Italian cut. In Blood and Black Lace, Fulci, who died in 1980 at the age of 57, has a good reason for taking on so many different types of subjects.|0
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature . Faulkner mostly wrote about his family and his own experiences, but he also explored many other topics. This is how he talked about it in a speech in Oslo, in October 1954. Faulkner is probably the most influential novelist to come out of the South since James. He wrote about the life of the people of the Delta in “A Fable for Critics”, and he wrote a novel, “Intruder in the Dust”, that was published in 1955. His last book was published in 2009.|0
A great movie. The movie was even better then the commercials put on. And believe it or not it was very very inspirational. I really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.It was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up. I laughed. I laughed very hard on some parts. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being CLERKS II).|1
First of all, around the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not an actual movie. I mean, I myself would choose a good Deniro movie or playing a video game any day. But, dude, what are you talking about? Now that I have that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? The video game adaption of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name.|1
Oh my gosh ! ! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This movie is so good ! ! ! I am so happy that you liked it and are looking forward to watch it again and again ! ! ! ! ! ! I really hope you can watch it as many time as you like. I will keep this movie for your future reference. I really enjoyed watching this and I hope you like it too. I really hope you can watch it. I love you guys and girls.|0
"""I am ... proud of 'Head',"" Mike Nesmith has said. He should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.Yes, it's unconventional. To many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: ""You figure it out. ""You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain."|1
At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you.|1
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film . I have got to say that it was a very touching film to watch. This is a film that will stay with you. I loved the way the film was done. It was both a comedy and tragedy. There is no way that you can make this film sound better than it was done. If you haven't yet watched this film then you are in for an eye-opener. Here are some of the reasons why this film has won the Academy Award for Best Picture:1. It's funny.|0
I can't get this flick off my brain. It's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. I've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did. There is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. It's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. Franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave.|1
I wonder why I have n't heard of this movie before . It 's truly a magnificent comedy ( I really liked the first movie and thought it was hilarious as well ! ) , but this new one has a different tone ! It's kinda funny and yet a bit strange . I'm not really sure of what it is exactly , but it has this kind of melancholic tone , that is a little out of place but it fits really well with the film . The music is not really great but the sound design and the voiceover in particular are very nice .|0
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I 've just managed to watch this film for the second time. It was the first time I saw him in a film, but as the name suggests, he is a musician, so this was one of the many movies he was involved in at the time. Anyway, what I did was to download it onto my iPhone, so as not to waste any bandwidth. There's a little bit about him in the film (he's playing a guitar when he gets a phone call), but it's mostly his acting that's worth talking about.|0
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development . Fulci was a master at creating horrific situations but he made it seem very real. I didn't have to be scared but it added a layer of terror and tension that had me holding onto my chair. The film opens in a quiet village in the Italian countryside where a single mother and her son have just taken refuge. The young boy is sick and she must find a doctor or he will die. In an act of kindness and generosity, the young boy's nurse is forced to nurse him.|0
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life , this time the creatures under the sea , in this extraordinary and deeply moving hour-long series on BBC television. The programme, first broadcast at the beginning of October, is the second part in the BBC Nature series. Here is an abridged, but highly recommended review written by William Rees, Head of Nature, BBC Natural History Unit. Attenborough has always had a special affection for wild life and the programmes he made in the 1970s and 80s – particularly the long-running series _The Country Life_ – brought to his attention some of the world's most majestic creatures.|0
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughs keep coming almost every minute. It's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with Jeff.|1
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother(Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend Billy(Rob Estes), maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't need to tell you what happens after that. This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This movie also has the best acting that I have seen in TV movies.|1
"""Hari om"" is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name(played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India. There's no ""Bend it like Beckham"" backdrops and stereotypes, and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood (however, the soundtrack is well worth procuring), but rather, the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors."|1
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... And it is very funny. So I didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of all show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I ever saw.|1
"A very suspenseful giallo from the director of ""L'Anticristo""(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.However the main story is about maniac(David Warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.The plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.The score by Francesco de Massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's ""The New York Ripper""(1982).Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!"|1
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a ""return to greatness"" but the series was never really great. Very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle/tagline: ""Chucky Gets Lucky."" So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky."|1
"The ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" scene was a riot. I also guffawed at the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the Japanese guy and said ""Pearl Harbor buddy"". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure because I can't count that high.Funny thing, this 10 line requirement. Seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long, not too short. I hope I don't make it to 1,000 words before I get to line 10.I'm still two lines short."|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once , about ten years ago . The movie was a lot more action-y than I was expecting and a lot more of a popcorn movie to me . I was not expecting a very long adventure story and a bit of romance in it . When the movie was over , I asked my husband what I should write about . He was kind enough to read all ten pages of the first paragraph and he told me the story was good , but not quite good enough to give it a five star review , so I wrote about it .|0
Lucio Fulci , later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie , was years earlier a leading film director of his time in Italy, where he had a successful career. His filmography includes a number of the most important Italian horror films. Fulci is known for his use of black and white as a key element in his horror pictures. This led him to use the color black as the main palette of his films. He is considered one of the first to use colored shadows. Fulci is known for his use of the closeup photography in horror pictures.|0
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!The cinematography is astounding, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they made it! Whether it is making models of creatures, or those impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it!2001 had some great tv shows to our screen.|1
"Films belonging to the ""film noir"" genre usually contain similar elements: a ""deus ex machina"" plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a denouement in the desert. Think ""High Sierra"" or ""White Heat. ""There is plenty of hard-boiled bad film noir out there. But when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.It is this latter tradition that ""Blind Spot"" belongs to."|1
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. Almost every single he put out was a hit.So, I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice.|1
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an elderly gay man and his former lover, respectively, on the HBO miniseries ""The Normal Heart,"" is something of a running gag on the gay blogosphere, especially since Cage and Cruz were not originally offered the role on the grounds that their names were too close to that of the film's producer, Peter Chernin, who, as an Orthodox Jew, was unwilling to have a movie about a closeted homosexual produced."|0
Hey all you jive hustlers , you stone foxes , you mean dudes . Watch out cause Slaughter is back ! And with a vengeance . You are in for some of the best action ever . In Slaughter of Empires you will have the opportunity to re-write the history of warfare in this game and take down some really big bad guys . So what are you waiting for . Get on down to your favorite game store and grab a copy of Slaughter of Empires and get ready for the blood bath that is about to unfold .|0
This is a good film , no doubt , but with some odd aspects . Without spoiling anything it takes a very strange story about a small group of people who have just been given an inheritance . The movie begins with the main character going to visit his family in London . He has not seen them for 20 years and is anxious to get to know them . This gives the audience a good insight in his character . But then we are introduced to his two sisters . They have been adopted at a young age and brought up as sisters .|0
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David . A young man from a small town in New Jersey wants something that his parents can not provide for him. He leaves town for New York City and finds work as a waiter at a famous fancy restaurant. The young man finds his way into the lives of a wealthy, beautiful woman, who is also his cousin. He is drawn to the young woman because he sees her as a reflection of the woman in the story he is trying to write.|0
"As a film buff, I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip ""If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon""). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation."|1
`` Live Together , Die Alone '' is divided into three main story lines , and each one of them is about three different people with very different lives. So to me that was a very important decision, and to me it would have made an interesting story if they all ended up together. So that is what we started with and we decided we wanted to make it longer than that, so we put that in. And I love the third story line even though it doesn't connect to the others at all. PG: I was wondering if the other people in those stories are related in some way?|0
"Lucio Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.This surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later Fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.The soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;Bruno's near-seduction by the naked Patrizia(Barbara Bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.Highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite ""House with the Windows That Laugh""(1976)."|1
"""Nuovomondo"" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young US-American directors are strongly influenced by that). Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me."|1
"If we could have ""Separate Tables,"" why not ""Separate Lies. ""This becomes somewhat involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. The latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. To complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident."|1
"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song, and now the terrific Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite TV shows as a kid, The A-Team. The only member he wouldn't be able to get was the late great George Peppard who played main character Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith, but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help. He did manage to reunite all members including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck #2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Capt."|1
Well , I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning . and the beginning had nothing to do with the end . I loved the movie . the action was fast and intense . the story was good . and the acting was great . the first few hours of the movie had me on edge . but by the end of it , i was in the middle of it . and by the end , i didn't care a single bit if it was going to be good or not . but it didn't matter to me , really .|0
Considering it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too.|1
Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii!|1
"The cover of the VHS says it all: ""Without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and I have to say, I agree 100 %. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forest-ranger). There's the twisted atmosphere, that only TCM has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror."|1
OK , so I loved Rachael Ray before , but now , I ADORE her ! How innovative . I think we all need a break from the mainstream . How is she able to make something out of what most people don't even know exist , I have no idea , but to me , it just feels great . I'm going back to watching TV , or reading a book , or playing some video games , or talking to someone , I can do that , I'm not trying to escape the real world , just escape into a world that is so much happier , and so much better .|0
The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ( `` The Antichrist '' , `` The Killer is on the Loose '' ) that I saw was `` The Last Man on Earth'' (1948) starring John Garfield, which I think is about the end of the world. The film concerns the last of four brothers in the country who live in a mansion in a secluded area. When the world is about to end the brothers decide to go off on a hunting trip so they can experience what is about to befall them.|0
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman : TAS and its ilk , I enjoyed it in a way that is not common on the internet, and I'm not much of a fan of the animation. It is not the type of art style that I enjoy, and the character designs in general are not for everyone, but then, I'm a fan of the characters themselves. It was a great show with many great and funny lines. I'm glad the animation is a lot better than I remembered it to be.|0
That 's right . Ohwon ( the painter and the main character ) is an exceptional person . What strikes me as I am reading through the book now that I finished it , it is more than obvious that the author has something to say . In fact , as the story develops , it is as if the author wants to put himself in the place of the reader . He wants to take us on a journey with himself . There are times in this book when it feels like he is actually writing the book . There are also times when you are left wondering why he would do that .|0
"Not a stunner , but a good movie to see once or twice . Bill Macy shows he can do anything and then some in this movie. He has a way of building the world with his own characters. He's like a father to me. There is a reason that I chose this movie for this month's ""Most Anticipated"" category. It's hard to say which film is ""most anticipated,"" but I can say I have seen three of the four nominated films (and more than a few of the contenders)."|0
"It took me a while to find this movie since they do n't have it yet on DVD ( and yes I know there are some other ones like that)

The movie is great. If you've ever watched the show, this movie is even better. So far, I'm only watching 2 episodes a week (so I still have time to finish.) I'll be done by the end of this week, but I hope I can wait for a DVD. __________________
If you have the chance to become a real genius, take the opportunity."|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I 'm Dancing.' I have no idea why it's not on DVD, but it was worth seeing. So, when the free tickets arrived, I took them and went out to see if I could catch the flick in its original format. I didn't see it, which is a real bummer since I would have loved to have seen Inside I'm Dancing in the first place. It is not a bad movie at all, in fact, I found it to be very entertaining.|0
The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 `` They Made Me a Criminal . '' `` Garfield , whose real name was John Galsworthy , was an English character actor who performed on the London and Broadway stage for many years before he began his Hollywood career with a small role in a film (1927 ) directed by Cecil B. DeMille. He starred in many films of the `30s and`40s before he made a major success with the movie `` The Awful Truth , ' '' in which the young star played a crook .|0
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally, at the end of the 1960's decade. It was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period - and were still ongoing - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam, and the volatile movement which followed the quieter, preceding postwar 1950's.All of this and one of the funniest films, then or now.Viewing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally.|1
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He's in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success.It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.|1
This movie got better with time . I ca n't believe that it has been forty years since I saw it on TV, in color . . . and it seems like such a long time ago. All in all , I rate this movie highly. In the mid-forties, a young man named Richard Wilkerson (Burt Lancaster) arrives in the small Southern town of Pine Hill, Alabama, to join his father who is a local sheriff. Wilkerson falls in with a group of outlaws who are in town to escape from an overbearing sheriff.|0
Hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a bad-ass, funky film to watch some night, this is just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Any who.|1
This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with a commoner's roots and significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths?of the film is that Im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik),?receive inspiration.The costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good.|1
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. One can get all sorts of movies on line...old movies, new movies... but it all targets a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Maybe if enough people will write in, the copyright holder will get a clue. It's about time for this to happen. Yes, it's date, but so is The Wizard of OZ.|1
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. I've been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I didn't care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but I find life is that way. It didn't bother me.|1
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? This film does not answer the latter question either way, but it does appear that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. Like most new producers/directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb).|1
So it 's not an award winner , so what ? Have you ever wanted to see a film that you would have never watched ? Of course, the list would be longer. But I will leave you to go to your local multiplex or the cinema and catch the latest film. You will enjoy it, you will see what you had missed in your daily routine. If it is an Oscar , you will not go to the cinema, it will be for a special occasion and you will not regret it, it will not make you feel hungry for something else.|0
Wow, What a wonderful film-making! Mr. Im has done it, again!His last work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great film, but this one is even greater. Selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year row, this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a Korean culture.Simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up' who was considered as a prodigy in the late Nineteenth century.|1
As I have said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. He's just so aggravating I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers. The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever.|1
"""Back in the Day"" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love Or Crime.Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone."|1
"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, by the process, their own lives are not that uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unsubtle quest for publicly-splashed revenge for countless past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and ""My Architect: A Son's Journey"" is that rare achievement.Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident."|1
I know this movie isn't for everyone, and I won't push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...It was the best I have ever seen!!! It was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't know what was gonna happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!|1
"Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance/adventure. And by this, I mean ""good"", not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. East meets West in a different take on the buddy film. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth."|1
`` Pearl Harbor , buddy . '' This movie is brilliant ! Sure it does n't exactly flow like an action movie , but it was made by a bunch of like-minded individuals with a lot of common interests. I really enjoyed watching the whole film , and now I know exactly what all the talk is about . '' There is even a short film on YouTube , I think . '' That's really interesting . What was it called , and where did you find it ? '' Thanks . I don't really remember . '' No , it's fine . It makes me feel good .|0
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live . I know personally most of the people interviewed . I can't believe that my own father is still alive and he still lives there . What I really liked about this film was that it didn't just tell us about the town, it also made us see it in a different way . Some of us who are old enough have never heard of it. Some of us even had never seen the town . Now we can see its beauty and I am so happy that they did what they did.|0
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD asap and watch it many times over. The story ends as it started I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor. Some stories do have happy endings.|1
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and gorgeous. What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy. The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. I never tire of watching Fred and Ginger but Lana Turner in this movie was just as terrific. I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. She should have done more dancing and less of the Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing.|1
'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. It is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. Yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! Nicolas Cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon.|1
"Well, what's wrong with the title ""Separate Lies"" (accused elsewhere of not being ""exciting""). It's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi film called ""Separate Lives"", which are alluded to here.) But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. OK, it's not an ""in-your-face"" hilarious title, but then it's not an in-your-face hilarious film. Please give British films like this a chance."|1
Very touching film , a great surprise to come up from Brazil , a country that usually exports features about corruption , police brutality and street crime , this film gives the world the chance to see what happens on the streets of the slums , something that can not be seen from a film or video camera, and the result is a very powerful and powerful film , one that I recommend , I think it will open people’s eyes and make them rethink the world around them , if you like this type of cinema , give it a chance and make this film a part of your world.|0
If you like who-dun-its , you will like this film , considered the best Italian detective story ( giallo ) of all time . if you think you are not up for a bit of thrills and chills , but are just looking for a story that will make you laugh , you are in trouble . this film tells a tale of a rich, powerful woman and the man who falls in love with her . her name is marina , which translates into sea-salt . a rich, powerful man of her own kind . so she comes from a family of millionaires and has no experience whatsoever of life .|0
I do n't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business , but I have to admit that this movie was one of the best in a very long time. The characters are well written and believable. It also has one of the sexiest love scenes you can ever imagine. So if you enjoy a good story with a good love story then I think you will like this. I hope you will watch this movie. This movie was great. It was very well acted. The characters were all very well drawn and the story was very real.|0
I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before. It's truly a magnificent comedy (I'd say farce, but it's too well acted and I'd hate to denigrate it's quality). A comedic character study about the travails of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can't have their long-time unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society, that pairs Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together.|1
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. (MINOR SPOILERS) As per usual, the main character, B, is the sane one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. He's known for making fake IDs. so an acceptance letter is no problem.Because B's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university.|1
Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an `` against the system '' type of movie and that the movie is not going to get any awards at the best of movies awards season, the movie has been doing a very good business so far with a decent opening in India and with a lot of buzz about it from people like us. It has not been doing the business as good as its going to be expecting. However, with good business and good buzz coming from all around and positive reviews coming on the whole, we don't need to say much about the movie for now.|0
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode , beside Peter Falk , you have Julie Newmar , Michael McKean, Robert Reed, Richard Kiley and Richard Dreyfus in the cast of this episode. Columbo’s story is the story of a murder investigation in which he gets the chance to play several different characters in the crime. The cast of Columbo , with Michael McKean , Robert Reed, Julie Newmar , and Richard Dreyfus. Columbo's story is a mystery that will not be revealed in the script. There are no clues in the story.|0
Barbora Bobulova's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by utilizing her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way Barbora does with this character. She was entirely believable as Valeria and I was swept away with her characterisation of this role. All at once the film was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound.|1
"After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode (""Three Minutes""), the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is. With the use of the boat, Jack and Sayid come up with a plan to confront ""The Others"". However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael to ""The Others"", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret whilst they are in the middle of nowhere.Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time has come to find out the time has come to find out what will happen if ""the button"" is not pressed."|1
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character . The humour of the movie is all in his performance. What I loved about Ali G was his ability to be both a bad man and a baddie at the same time! I love to watch Ali G in the bad guy mode because it’s a fun dynamic and it’s great to see an actor do that. It reminds me a little bit of Michael Clarke Duncan, and I’m a huge fan of Duncan.|0
This movie was great. It had everything a true action fan could want. Plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with, violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end, and villains that are just asking for it. Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again.|1
"People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with what they see. But if you're a fan of comic books, you'll find this one entertaining and well worth the wait. The story is set in the future and the year is 2501 A.D. In a future ruled by a benevolent alien species known as the ""Aquans,"" Earth is at the centre of the universe and humanity is scattered over the galaxy. But at the dawn of a dark war, a small band of renegades from Earth arrive in the far reaches of space."|0
"The movie is incredible, it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie. THe lines in the movie are great, such as ""Nothings to good for out friends"" and ""Its collection time Charlie collection time."" I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind. I feel that when i watch this movie I want to go out and shoot down bad guys, If there is a movie that you don't want to miss its this one."|1
First of all , around the time I wrote this comment , I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written . In the end , the article was a little bit better . I was glad to see that she was not going to ignore her mistake . I could only hope for better future articles by both of us . However , I could also read some other comments about that article that made me think again about what kittiwake-1 had written . Some people were saying it was better to write a bad article than to write nothing . I think I agree with this advice .|0
Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over.|1
I will admit , I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film , and after about 5 minutes , I started feeling a bit nauseous and thought it's going to take me until the end of the day before I get to see the film again . how wrong was I , because I found the film very engaging and thought that this film deserves a re-watches , because it doesn't get enough credit or recognition . and to be honest , the fact that I could say it's the 2nd best film i've seen this year , just proves that I'm not just talking about myself .|0
I 've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie . I agree that the story is very well written . I did not agree with this film though . One of the scenes in this movie is when the main character is driving on the highway on a long winding road with many other cars that have no air conditioning and no windows that were going in a different direction . In this scene I think they are doing this because they have no air conditioning . I think the main character had a very bad attitude in this movie .|0
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary ( a lot ) - but he is funny ! He will take a good care of the girls but you will have to make sure that he does not go on too long . Chucky is back with new adventures for the Dolls. This time he is with his girlfriend who is always by his side. She wants to prove that she is a good girl and that she deserves a good life with Chucky. But how to make Chucky see her as a good and decent girl and not a bad one ?|0
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage in places. This is true, and is the biggest flaw of this film. However, it isn't so often, or so bad, that one shouldn't see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see this. Aside from having seen Black Sabbath in the Sevnties and early Eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined OZZfest just like in this video.|1
I saw this movie on PBS the first time . Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. It’s not that the film is terrible — in fact it has some really interesting things to say that you might not have thought of if you had not seen it again and again — but there’s so much so-so-so going on in it and it just becomes so much like watching paint dry, you’re so focused on the same things over and over again and nothing else is worth your attention.|0
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. True, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream American production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I easily dare to call this film a masterpieceit's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror.|1
"Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including ""N.I.B. "", ""War Pigs"", and ""Paranoid"".Also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans."|1
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not : intelligence and good messages . Accepted , intelligent as it is , there are moments in this movie that are very touching . For the first time ever in Hindi cinema, this is one film where I was crying and laughing and smiling at the same time . The dialogues and the story are very simple but there are a lot of layers in there that have been woven in a way that they bring out emotions in the viewers. There are very few movies in India these days that have made a mark and this one has .|0
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.Tina Fey and Kristen Wiig are in the movie and you can see Tina Fey as a young girl named Tina who looks exactly like Tina Fey.You really can't help but feel happy to see Kristen Wiig, even if you never met her before you can feel her in the movie, she is so wonderful and the only reason she is there is for the cat mom character she was the only person who I could relate to.The movie is about Tina trying to get her cats back after their mother is killed.|0
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80 's , and this one is even better . this is the best show ever made . it's funny and sad , exciting , violent and heart-wrenching and is the best anime ever made ! this is a remake of the anime classic . this one is even more awesome than the original . you're watching the original movie with a new story ! and this movie is way better , and better than the original version . this movie is way more amazing and the original movie is just a copy of the original film .|0
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Academy Award winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see.|1
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave . I 'm happy with that , I think I'll stick to the classics for a while. I love a good horror , and SCREAM has all the ingredients needed to make one of the best films ever made. If there's any way to top this film , I think i've already found it. Great review! I was thinking about what I could have done differently. In my opinion, it would have to be better edited. But, I'm glad you like the film.|0
Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller, was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. Group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content.|1
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people would n't like it . the way it starts off feels like it is going in a wrong direction . the story is that the film is about a young boy who finds out that he can fly ( he is a child prodigy but is in the gifted program at the local school ) and that is the reason that he gets to play with his father's new toy . somehow or other his father discovers that is a flying saucer . and then the film goes off in a different direction .|0
I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline . I go to the movies and have seen this movie in the theater. The reason I say that is it was just me watching it, not even seeing it on a DVD. I do have an account and a few posts, so I am going to give it a chance. The movie didn't disappoint! It had some good performances. It was a good mix of horror, suspense and drama. Let's just say the first half wasn't the best and the 2nd half was the best.|0
Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good. Great supporting cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as the extortionist private eye.The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his Jerry Lundergaard role from Fargo. He has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulating and deceitful character. It's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel, and for a while I was happy that things were turning out well for him.|1
No. I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don't Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm.|1
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. In 1969, the transition among African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. Special mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery.|1
This is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. Without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only- a Sicilian farm, the boat,and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything. I wonder if this was to save money? No street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close ups. And the music...what on earth was going on with playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they were out?|1
"I saw this film at a small screening. Even though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. It's April 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their ""mid 20's"" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes."|1
The `` all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... '' scene was a riot . I think it's a good scene but I don't think it's as good as the others in the film. There is a good sequence near the end of the film, with the characters talking to themselves, which is the only good bit of the film for me. (I don't know why, but there is something in it.) The rest is terrible, even though it's not a bad movie.|0
I'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. This is the definition of being a horror film. I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part.|1
I never thought I 'd say this about a biopic , but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (and some misdirection) about this movie. It takes you through the lives of two very distinct and completely different types of people. You have a girl from the East side who is always trying to make her way up, and the son of a doctor, who lives in the hills and is always trying to make his own way. It does a good job of describing the culture, and it also succeeds at making you empathize with the characters.|0
OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, I ADORE her! How innovative. I love that she has a cooking section- I admit that occasionally I skip that part, only because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. I love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. I love how personable she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her Mystery Guests.|1
"Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a disabled person's body? ""I can't wait to see you and tell you all about it."" And that was all I said to my wife when we met again and I was back home again after all the fun. I couldn't take my eyes off her! She was a real person, not an image on a screen or in my mind. You see, like most people who can't stand to sit in a straight chair, I love to get out and move around."|0
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. As with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we probably will never know.|1
When the trailer for Accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. It's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. That being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one.|1
I love the TV contest . Hate to see it end . There are so many talented contestants . It’s very unfortunate they are going through this right now . I don’t agree that they are talented. There are many, many, many, many, talented contestants. Just not the same kind of talent that The Voice had in its heyday. And it is sad. I am not surprised that Christina is going through all of this drama. In her own way, she’s the opposite of The Voice’s success.|0
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville's Century Theatre. A well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director Julian Fellowes. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'.|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west .... sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie has to stop for a second while the director and star get ready. I did enjoy it though as there was a certain sense of urgency. It's a little too slow for me. There was just one or two too many pauses in the action. There was enough to go around, but this is the one thing I was looking for in this movie. But I didn't like the plot, it was too predictable, too short, and too easy.|0
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads . The movie is a bit of a mixed bag for me. I liked it. But I was a bit surprised that they took the opportunity to have one of their actors make a cameo in the movie. Anyway, it has an all-around good time, which I like. The action is very interesting, the storyline is not as bad as most movies like it, and there are some nice comedy scenes in there. The acting was not amazing, but it was fine.|0
This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.I don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I haven't even read the book, and guess what?|1
This is one of my favorite films , ever . The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so interesting . The acting and the score are both just fantastic . It has something for everyone . Even kids will get a kick out of it . I just love that movie . You should definitely get it . This is a film that you really must see . I love it so much . A must see . You won't regret seeing it . There is no way you're gonna be disappointed with this film .|0
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, Tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. Tiffany and Chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk! !Don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. It is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!My rating : 9/10.|1
"Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I'm wondering why Cagney wasn't in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole ""swimming"" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly miscast."|1
"The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort , and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. But his film, ""The Great Dictator"" was never shown anywhere in public. Chaplin and his wife suffered the consequences, but they could afford to have their home in Paris protected from the threat of war. The Chaplins suffered in many other areas during the war, but France's Chaplinesque tradition was still going strong. The Chaplins left Paris during the occupation. Charlie Chaplin went on to direct a couple more films, and also made a short for the War Effort Fund."|0
"What a shame this movie was never released. (It is now playing on cable.) I tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones I've been paying to see in theatres recently. I like to be surprised. So often movies are marketed as ""offbeat,"" but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel. This movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel."|1
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO clips. This is pretty amazing. I’ve been trying to find out what was going on during the break but never have been able to and I’m pretty sure I have to give up on it. What the hell is going on? It’s not like there is a break for the players to watch TV or go out to eat or something. This just has to be a very well-thought-out thing.|0
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen ! The images that are shown here are not just spectacular but are also stunningly beautiful in their own right. The story that this movie tells is one of the most heart-rending, touching stories ever told and I am very sorry that it was never made into a movie. This film is a must have for anyone wanting to see some truly incredible images that you will never be able to see again or that will change your view on life and death for ever. This is just stunning and so well made.|0
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt, My parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and twilight zone (new and old) couldn't do. This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.I still cannot believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did this. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone.|1
As I have said before , I am NOT a fan of Tweety . He 's just so aggravating I can 't even stand the guy . The way he speaks , he just makes everything he says sound like he's speaking to an audience . As I have said before , I am not a fan of Tweety . He ’s just so annoying I can’t even stand his annoying . The way he talks , it’s just makes everything he says sound like he’s talking to an audience , not to his fans . And that’s annoying .|0
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. I taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four but my tape is severely worn now and I would love a new copy of it.I have e-mailed Film Four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as I know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. I have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. The performances are superb. The film has everything. Its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days.|1
"Chucky (the murderous doll from ""Child's Play"" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using ""Voodoo for Dummies"") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds."|1
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer, one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be ""forgotten"" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan ""that's hot"" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???"|1
I just saw this film and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.|1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a group of young Italian boys and a young female lead is the way he got his best known films to be released on video. Many people know him for the cult horror movie that he made with the group of boys, but he had a lot of other films that had great young actors in them. It was in this film that he found one of his best young actors that he had worked with before in another film, a young Luca Barbareschi.|0
I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast ! And I’m glad it was on the small screen because I really enjoyed it ! It was so cool ! And the cast was so great ! It’s nice to have them back and to see a different perspective on them and their characters. I hope the network will do more movies like this one and maybe even have an original story like this one about them. And hopefully we’ll get to meet them on TV !|0
Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates `` Separate Lies , '' a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson , Linda Kash and Kate Mara . Wilkinson plays a young man who is accused of a crime and sentenced to prison. The prison authorities take him aside and tell him he is not the same man he was before his incarceration, that he is now a different person with a new life ahead of him. He thinks he will die there. They tell him there is no hope of that. The movie, which is based on a real story, goes to great lengths to point out how wrong these prison officials were.|0
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film ! Hat 's off to Ben Daniels , Lavinia Currier and everyone that helped to bring this wonderful film into our world ! I had no idea about her story and the courage and perseverance it takes to live and love as she has , and I am so very happy I saw the film when I did . Hats off to all the producers of this film for giving this young lady and others the opportunity to tell her story . I have been fortunate to meet a few people from this film and they are all amazing people and such inspiring stories .|0
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. Fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.This film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Living Dead, House by the Cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of Italy.|1
"Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji , a Japanese poet and writer who was active in both the literary and occult communities. Miyazawa died on February 16, 2015 at the age of 89. Contents show]

Summary

""I want you to know that it was I who took your father's life, and you are not my son, but I am his son, just as your mother is your sister. I will love you, and protect you, just as your sister was always protected by her sister."|0
The movie does n't take itself seriously , and if you follow its lead you 're going to have a great time and learn some interesting things about film and human nature. It is a movie with a message , one that it seems to take very seriously indeed . But the point is , most movies do. The trick is to get out of your way and let them get their message to you. If you let them , the message will get you , but if you try and stop them they will have their own way .|0
"I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. I go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a ""story"". I found this to be a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :)Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere isn't an over-actor. He held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. He brings his own style to the movie.I think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told."|1
Before I forget , let me say the artwork in here is outstanding . From garbage cans to the huge space station . The story is amazing . But the ending of the story left me with a feeling of despair . There was too much going on . I don't have much of an opinion about the ending . But if you are a space enthusiast , you might want to go back and reread to see if it is worth the wait. I loved this read. Loved the way the author used the main characters names. Great writing.|0
Exclusively for Coop 's lovers , though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this film . The film is very good indeed , very much like other great westerns , but I have to wonder how well it holds up in the era of Blu-ray . I've only seen the original on DVD , but the Blu version is a different matter . A lot of the detail in Eastwood as a gunslinger is missing , and I am left with the feeling that there is way too much color in some of the shots .|0
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it again one more time before I... well.. you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) ""captures"" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end?"|1
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. I tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. The film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. It's one of my favorite slasher films and I have no idea where an uncut version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the USA where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen.|1
As an English teacher , I appreciate films that do more than tell a story . Good films , like Gone with the Wind , that entertain the audience, not only on the screen. A film that makes you forget to put the remote control down and watch it in the dark, when you are alone in the dark. Like The Piano, which I have not seen, but which has the ability to transport the viewer to an entirely different setting and world, one that they can’t possibly understand until they have watched it.|0
I 've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark . I have to agree with many of them . There are some great actors on that network , but the writing is often weak . I'm hoping they can get their act together and have the kind of show they used to have. I also think they should have put some more shows on . I like the show and I've seen a couple episodes , I just want it to be good . I am not surprised that it isnt good , since it is Showtime .|0
"A very weird, psychedelic, esoteric, (and did I say weird? :) experience.But on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, Hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program and the adult, musically growing and evolving, and yet still a little silly Monkees of the '70s and beyond.The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith's, ""If they think we are plastic now, wait till they see how we do it."""|1
"""Showtime"" is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents,A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(Eddie Murphy)a cop, tries to arrest Mitch not knowing he's a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz."|1
"""Pearl Harbor, buddy."" This movie is brilliant! Sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. I'm one that goes for silliness, much like ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Airplane"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece!"|1
"""Blind Spot"" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love."|1
What a great film! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. The music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change a thing in this film, it was all good!|1
"Yes, at times ""Unconditional Love"" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, unconventional flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film."|1
"What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm .... Only that this was one of the best shows I have ever seen .... And that's saying something. The episode starts out with a little teaser trailer (and a few minutes later I get a ""You need to see this"" alert) of the actual episode ... This was one of those episodes that made me laugh out loud several times when I watched it ... It's an episode I will remember for many many years ... It was funny, exciting and just plain interesting ..."|0
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be . Terrible acting ! Implausible scenerios ! Ridiculous death scenes ! Ridiculously over the top ! Ridiculous plot twists ! Ridiculous characters ! The worst movie ever ! It has everything you could imagine that you don’t want in a film . It has no style , no creativity , no soul . There are only the worst of the worst, and we’ve got to start by making a list . But first, we have one more movie to talk about . “Death Wish 3” is the third entry in the film series, which stars Bruce Willis.|0
Pity the Monkees . People always accused them of being manufactured ( which they were ) or being nothing more than a joke. However, they were in fact a hit with both the record and the music fans. One of the reasons was because they had a unique sound that was different from other groups of that time. The music is so simple, yet they used many different styles of music in their songs. One style they had was rock. This rock sound was very unique compared to other groups, most of which used the same style, but changed the instrumentation or even the lyrics.|0
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as just another patchwork of mindless violence. And while there is a fair amount of mayhem, DEATH WISH 3 is not that awful of an effort, particularly for fans of the series and its star.This time out, aging Charlie's Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory, where he once again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good versus evil.|1
This interesting film noir features three very good performances : Sanders , Patrick , and Blackmer . The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are very good . The first scene between them is very touching and romantic in a very subtle way . It is a wonderful scene . The rest of the two are very good also . The plot is great . Very interesting and very entertaining . I liked this film a very much . A must see . This is an American film noir with great performances . There is nothing else to add . I love the story . It is very interesting , very touching .|0
I am a guy, so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear likes to be in tear jerker movies. I would rather watch action/adventure/sci fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a tear jerker. Diane tended to over act a few times, as did richard, but they brought it around and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude, so you started out hating her. The movie is way too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece.|1
"Separate LIES changed my life . Actually , the Q & A did.SPOILERS BELOW . Read only if you watch the series

This is one of those stories that started out with an ending I never expected . It’s not the ending you expected it to be , but the ending you hoped for . And then I read the next chapter and I read the next and the next . And now here we are. So , there has been this one scene in a series of stories that I have been waiting to write because it is one of the best ."|0
What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'.The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered.|1
`` A Slight Case of Murder '' is an excellent TV movie , which is defiantly worth the price of the DVD , and even the Blu-Ray itself . it tells the true story of how two high school boys went on a road trip with their parents . they head out to a secluded area to have the kind of fun only a group of friends could ever provide , but things soon turn dark , as the boys soon discover they may never get back to where they belong . it's a story that could easily have been turned into a Lifetime movie , if it was done right .|0
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's Academy Awards, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find out about his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. My Architect follows Kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings, and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius.|1
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.The film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from Muscular Dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, as Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying.|1
As many of today 's movies are guilty of , the plot is n't exactly stellar , the movie does get better the farther you go , but is not a great movie by any means ! . but then again it's not even a movie . it's one of the few movies I saw on tv back then . the movie is so bland , that the movie has no plot to be found . it's like the movie doesn't even try to be good . it's just so bland , the movie does not have a point .|0
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode, beside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fiancé, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides Columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money.|1
Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time . Excellent original music , clever , heady ... it makes you want to throw things in your face , and laugh hysterically at it. The only thing that can spoil the film is a very annoying child , and this is probably the film's only flaw, as it is so funny . The only real drawback to the film is that it is about two children who happen to meet . It doesn't make any of them likable, but I think it makes for an enjoyable film. Great film.|0
"Great show! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps. Contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. Grease has truly become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. ""You're The One That We Want"" is sure to gain even more Grease followers."|1
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime , Lifetime Movie Network, Lifetime Original Movies and on the Lifetime Television channel. I also watched The Man in the Maze and The Woman in Black on Netflix, I watched The Secret of NIMH on Lifetime TV, Netflix and YouTube. The man in the maze. The man in the mazes is the one that is trapped in a mazes maze. He escapes after being trapped for 7 years, but the man in the maze is never the same again.|0
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade . She smokes and drinks . She does n't have a lot of luck with men . What is she doing wrong and how can i change her life? She is also very good at makeup and hair, but that's the extent of her talent. But she is talented in that she knows exactly what to do to make you laugh and cry at the same time, and has a voice that sounds like someone is shouting into your ear. So what can i expect from her? I have no clue!|0
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the ""tramp"" and Dutchess is the ""lady,"" but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.Phil Harris is our tomcat O'Malley."|1
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread . Louis de Berniere’s story is one that I would love to hear more about, as well as see the story unfold. Louis is a French Canadian, born on December 26th, 1933. His father is Jean de Berniere, who came to Canada in the 1880′s. It seems like his father was a man who was very much at peace with the world. I remember him as being a quiet, but strong, man. My grandfather’s family was French Canadian.|0
Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and , by the process , their own lives, family relationships, religion , and culture, and by doing so, find the answer to why they do or don't have children, as well as how and why to have one . This series was created with the purpose of giving back to the fans who supported the show by providing the opportunity for viewers to experience the joy of watching documentaries with their children about their lives , their families, their cultures and their traditions. The series focuses on what happens after a documentary is made .|0
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an ""against the system"" type of movie and attitude. It is an excellent portrayal of the ""system"" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. The funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That is what college should be about..I come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines."|1
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I 've seen in a while . It 's an emotional roller-coaster and it's the kind of movie that can't be summarized, but if you're not a fan of romantic movies in general then you probably wouldn't understand this movie 's main story . You would just think it's about a man and woman who fall in love, and you would probably end up bored with the movie . However, Condi is the main character and her story isn't just that, it's an emotional journey that leaves you speechless and filled with tears.|0
"""D.O.A"" is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his caustic best; and Quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, doesn't really make much of an impact. The film is stylishly directed throughout, drawing on a number of influences to capture its 'seamy' feel. Would you credit that it's actually directed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography."|1
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I am glad that Walker got his brother Luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching True stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders.|1
Jeff Garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his screen persona is hilarious; but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, performing success, and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. The supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship, and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes.|1
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper , but no one he thought was his friend can touch him he will give his life for it . I think Ali loved the show. He did not want to lose the friendship of this guy but he was so stubborn. Ali wanted to be his friend he loved him so much that he couldn't stand that he wasn't Ali's friend that he was losing so much . Ali was so happy that he made this guy a better rapper he was the one who taught him everything.|0
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters . I had never heard of this movie before a friend told me about it one evening. I was curious about it and I decided to try and find it. It turns out there was not much online about it. I was surprised. Then I found a review in the Los Angeles Times. The reviewer made a few critical points, and then said that he had no idea who was involved in the movie and that he had seen the movie and liked it. So that was that.|0
My impression, having seen this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film. He took five years to make it, a labour of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take out. His father, the renowned architect Louis Kahn,comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity.|1
The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music . Filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman, Luis Buñuel and Jean Cocteau used cinema as a means to change the way people thought and the way people lived. In this post I will look at what the 70s had to offer. I have divided the 70s films in 4 different periods, as we will see during these periods there was more change in the film industries than we usually think . In the first section I’m going to see what the 50s was. The 50s was a period of transition.|0
"In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was ""The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks"". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the ""Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide"" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit."|1
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother doesn't take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother.|1
"Due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in Italy, at least) I didn't expect much from this movie. Thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house (""LA CASA MALEDETTA"" means ""The cursed house""). Well, I had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different..."|1
I love the TV contest. Hate to see it end. There are so many talented contestants. It's a shame that only 2 will be picked. I love watching the judges also. At times they are as entertaining as the contestants. I have been watching the show faithfully every Sunday night. Wouldn't miss it for the world. It's the best reality show that's ever been on television. Good luck to all the contestants, though I have already chosen the two who I would like to see play Danny and Sandy on Broadway.|1
* May Contain Spoilers * The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was about 13 and I was really confused by the choice. It had the same director and the same cast that appeared in The Exorcist, plus a young woman as an assistant to the main priest. I didn't like what I saw so I left the house and never returned. When I was a young adult I saw it in a movie theater with an open mind and I was really impressed by the production value.|0
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then do n't watch that. This movie is full of moments where I had a feeling about what is going to happen next in the story. The acting is very poor and there is not much chemistry between the actors. The music is decent. The story is good but there are very few surprises. Do n't waste your time with it. Not as good as the first but still worth the watch! What happens when an alien invades our earth, and the government finds itself unable to track down and stop him?|0
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I made my homework.Still, the show caught my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.But the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.The lead actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance.|1
In an early scene , Luca ( David Pasquesi ) and James ( Jeff Garlin ) are walking down a dark and narrow street. James is holding out his arms to Luca for help as they both walk. After a while, Luca asks James to stop so that they can get to the bottom. James tells him to go on ahead, so Luca follows James as they get to the bottom. Later on, Luca looks out at the night and sees James, and Luca runs to the window and sees that James has fallen and broken his ankle.|0
"Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot . Some dude named Gerald Ford, who I think is in his 50's, is walking down the street in the middle of the day, when a little kid in a wheelchair stops him and says, ""How are you, Mr. President?"" He replies, ""Oh, I'm good. I'm great. How are you?"" And the kid says, ""I don't know, man. I'm pretty good. I'm pretty good."""|0
Who ARE the people that star in this thing ? Never heard of them ! ! But this is one of the best and most impressive movies ever ! ! I don’t know why there is such a big fan of this movie, but I definitely enjoyed it ! What’s really cool though is that I saw this movie the day it came out, way back when, and then again a couple years later. I have never read a review so well-written. Thank you so very much to all those who made it.|0
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.The three lead actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.This film doesn't take the easy way out.|1

We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat -- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a tough time at the beginning of the film thinking he would be the star of the movie, but he soon found that he was the butt of everyone else's jokes. He had a wonderful time and enjoyed the whole movie.This is one of my favorite movies. There are several things that I liked about the movie. First, the plot was interesting and kept your interest. You never did get bored of the story. The action was fun and had some interesting moments.|0
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts . But it will put the film to shame in every way, so you have nothing to worry about about that. I don't want to waste any time on this, because it will be clear as day whether or not I've read the book. I just want you to be aware of the movie. If you've read the book, I have no problem with you buying it. I think you should be able to take it or leave it, but I'll give you the option to not read it.|0
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and was such a delightful movie. It was shot beautifully around India and I want to go there now. The main actor..Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie..Monsoon Wedding. He was the total star of the show. Benoit's character cracked me up...was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great too. They were all great!|1
"Films belonging to the `` film noir '' genre usually contain similar elements : a `` deus ex machina '' (a supernatural being) who helps a victim. In this film, however, none is needed. The story unfolds on the streets of Paris in 1935, and the central figure is a taxi driver. --

The film was produced and directed by Robert Siodmak (1913-2002), known as ""the father of horror movies."" Siodmak began as a newspaper journalist, but soon began writing films, most notably in the early 1930's."|0
`` Blind Spot '' one of my festival favorites . I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers sitting in a car talking about their favorite show '' '' '' '' '' and how it''s so much cooler than it used to be. It''s one of my favorite shows of all time . But I''ve always been a skeptic on the reality that strangers sitting in the backseat of a car could have the same conversation as in a studio . And I''m glad I never had to witness it first hand!''|0
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid; and even then I sensed the silliness of it all. The low budget, horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then. I watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so.|1
What a surprise . A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor ' only naughtier . Funny guy , but with a lot more of it . This guy is just great . I'll never forget the late 90s when there was this one kid , he would get in trouble at school because he read books and he couldn't read yet , I was the first kid in my family to read a book , my father used to hide the books I brought home from school when i would ask to borrow them , he didn't like me reading those books for a long while .|0
"So it's not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? ""The Villain"" and this one could top the list.My husband says that ""Jekyll and Hyde Together Again"" is one of those movies that if ""you've been there and done that"" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes.... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate."|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie . I am not saying this lightly . I think this movie was one of the most well made movies I have seen so far this year. The film had a very interesting storyline . I loved how the characters were all played by real life actors . There were also a lot of funny moments in this movie . I would rate this movie as 9/10 . Overall the film was well made and a good watch . In fact it was a very pleasant watch . It was not just a movie but a very enjoyable experience .|0
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it.|1
Easily Lucio Fulci 's most respected film , `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is highly renowned for it's gruesome and brutal imagery. The movie has been banned in several European countries, but is still very much talked about. Many of the film's shocking scenes do not even make it into Italian law, and it remains legal to use violence in the movie. The picture is considered one of the best ever made on film and has many fans who still adore it. The film features one of the most talked about scenes in film, when a young girl's life is threatened by two men.|0
In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love for Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented.|1
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot.|1
"Very touching film, a great surprise to come up from Brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... Magical realism is a very hard task, and I believe João Falcão has made it wonderfully. It seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. Although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão has been influenced by the series ""Hoje é Dia De Maria""."|1
I was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas.|1
I thought Besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them; Capture true human emotions. The main character's struggles, triumphs, set backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most Hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical Sci-Fi labeling and become a true drama. However calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot.|1
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though I find Nirvana overrated). It sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. Jansen puts in little touches like the books (Kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. And you can really feel that in this.|1

I do n't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor . You need to learn to get along with OTHER people and respect their views and experiences, but not have the nerve to do the same for you. I know this will be difficult to understand, but that's the way it is, and you'll probably never understand it. Yours is not a personal problem, and neither is anyone else's. If you ever have a personal problem you have a problem with everyone, because everyone's opinion is just as valid.|0
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . That would be fine if the story were good. The story is decent enough but the film does not come to life. The cinematography also has some nice moments which help but does not save the film altogether. The film opens with the film's title in the opening scene . It is an opening where we are given a flashback of the lead character being a very young child during a war. This flashback is interesting and we get to understand more of the character's past.|0
The film is n't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch . The story is very well written and the way that the actors play their roles makes you laugh even more. There are a lot of funny scenes and I could go on about them but I won't because I want to encourage you to watch this flick on the big screen . I recommend it to you if you are a fan of funny comedy or you are looking forward to watch it because this is one of those films that I would want to see again .|0
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE, and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. It still is very funny (Chaplin in disguise as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age.|1
"In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting James to remark, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman."" A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca remarks, for referential effect, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly Filipino woman."|1
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan , where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion . One of my colleagues told me he liked it. Well , there are certainly some things that strike me as interesting about it . First of all, the director is a relative newcomer in Mexico with no experience in film . This is probably the first time in my life that I have actually heard this criticism . I think he has done some good movies , some good documentaries , and even a few good TV shows , and I would certainly give him a chance for the rest of his films .|0
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I , which gave us Werner Herzog 's `` Lessons of Darkness ''' (1962) . We've been talking for two hours about it, and you can get the book here for $3.75 (plus sales tax.) I haven't read it -- but I have been listening to "" Lessons from a Life of War and Peace "" on the NPR hour-long history of the world's wars in two-hour blocks since it came out. It's worth it to see the kind of guy who would be in such a documentary."|0
I saw this movie on it 's opening night , and enjoyed it . I probably would have enjoyed it better if it was more of it . It's also a good story . But it's too much of everything that I hate about the modern cinema . A lot of the plot lines were predictable and I got bored trying to figure out who the main characters were . And when they were revealed , they were pretty predictable . Even the plot lines themselves were predictable . The ending was weak . I expected a lot more from the script . I would have liked to have seen more .|0
One of the most magnificent movies ever made . The acting of Charles Buchinski ( later known as Bronson ) is amazing. The editing is top notch . I can never understand people who think the movie was made as a documentary . it was made to showcase the beauty of a beautiful girl. It is very true that this is not a documentary . It is not a movie about what was happening in Hollywood at the time and how the film came about. The movie shows how beautiful this girl was and the man who loved her.|0
"It took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on DVD (and my VCR is not worth hooking up again). I guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. It is a slap stick spoof in the vein of ""Airplane."" I must say that when I watched it on Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than I do now."|1
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. That's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!Next thing you know he's in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes here include a starving Charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.When Charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring.|1
This is a wonderful movie , and I still love it ! It just so magical and it is fun to go to the theaters ! I think this movie is a must-see for everyone !!! It is one of the best movie of the year !! I think this movie will win the best movie !!! Everyone who see it, must to go to the theaters , because it is the best movie this year and I like it so much. This movie is a very interesting one. The plot is very simple.|0
I gave it a seven only because the acting is good . And of course by that I mean Wilkinson’s. But I have to give it a zero for story, because that’s not the point of the story, it just is. The point is how it feels, that’s the story. I’m happy with it. So I don’t really care how you rate it, but what I would tell people who are looking to give a movie a better review, I think, what would you say about the movie itself?|0
`` Hari om '' is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name. Hari om, the word, is used as a greeting, and the greeting itself is used in the film. It is used in various contexts, such as to wish someone well. The Hindi word for '' is '' and it is used as the second person pronoun in Hindi, similar to what we would use when saying my name. The word '' is a combination of the word 'hari'' and the phrase ''om'' (which is used in a similar context to this). ''|0
Let's be fair: there are no RULES for scriptwriting, so I won't say the movie SHOULD be something other than it is. I'll just state my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. However, I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. Since this movie was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical.|1
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10 , and it just blew my mind. One of the greatest shows ever created, but it was also the only one I had the money for so I only had it for one season. I loved it, but I just had too much time to devote to watching and didn’t realize I had enough time to finish the series in the end. When I found out that the last episodes had already aired, I couldn’t believe it, but it was true.|0
"I don't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. You need to get your head out of your up-tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! If this isn't your ""cup of tea"", so to speak, then look at it for what it truly is- a damn funny movie. Maybe they DID set out to make yet another drugs/T&A movie, but in this case, they've truly hit the spot. It's especially funny for the Ali G fans, because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him."|1
"This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film (which is excellent). It borrows the main premise--a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English professor, instead of a private dick, as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake. But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score)combined with an affected ""noir"" feel."|1
A labor of love . Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you . Then the sheer emotion and story-telling . I have to thank you all for your time and effort . You have all helped me to make this film what it is now. I can't say it enough, and I want to thank every one of you for everything. You have made me feel like a million bucks and made a movie that means so much to me and will mean so much to others as well. Thank you all so much.|0
An interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine much the same as my Grandfather did at that time. Travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships, I cannot imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this film.Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities.|1
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I 've ever seen on film . I do not consider it a film , however it is not a silent movie , it is full of sound and you can make out every word the characters say . The acting in it was superb , and I have been a fan of Griffith for years and years . The music was excellent and made the film even better. I am still in shock that I have to wait another 2 days for the release of the film , when I can see it in my neighborhood on dvd and on the screen at home .|0
"This movie is true action at its finest, It doesn't get any better then this. This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this. My favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a TV or something and he goes right up to them and yells ""I will come in here anytime i like!!!"" and right before he jumps out the window he yells ""Anytime!!!"""|1
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail.|1
Gary Busey 's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography . Since had a musical background , he was able to tap into his inner child and play a little with it all by himself . And the kid in him was definitely happy with his role in the film which is about a little boy who is bullied by his older brother , and in the end wins him over . We don't have anything new about the movie itself which is a true story about two bullies in a small town in New South Wales in the 60's .|0
"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a "" Conchie "" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes ."|1
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerilla-film-making, no sets (just disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Also, even the black&white film-stock was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect, but it worked.Reno was amazing as the Brute. Everyone's acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you.|1
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie . It follows all the rules of the Hollywood blockbuster, but instead of making the audience wait until the very last minute for the big twist, the movie introduces them in a way that makes the audience eager to know what happens next. There’s also a lot of symbolism in the narrative that’s not really explained by the main characters in the film; this is what makes The Dark Crystal look like a real film, but not one that is based on a book by Philip Pullman.|0
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n ' roll . The young singer/songwriter was born on July 25, 1937 in Tulsa Oklahoma, the same day Elvis was born. Holly's life spanned from age 5 to 17 when the family moved to Los Angeles. Buddy Holly was not only an innovator in his music, he also became a pioneer in the battle for racial equality and civil rights. In 1954, Holly moved to Memphis, Tennessee with his wife and 4 kids. There, the family settled in the suburb of Forest Hills and began their life in a black community.|0
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction.|1
I usually give horror films around 6/10 , but this one caught my eye . House of Wax was by a French director, but I believe was produced by the U.S. The movie was about a woman who has lost her husband . She has a son with his new wife, and her son lives with her in the same apartment complex . The film opens with a funeral home in the background. It is shown through the eyes of the widow of the man who got killed . She walks through the streets with her young son .|0
"it 's a great movie for the whole family . i do n't think many people have seen it cause i never read the books . anyway , this is the synopsis :

""an old man tells the story of his life . he lives with a wife and daughter , he gets to the age where he wants to take care of his grand-daughter so he moves in with his neighbors . he is an alcoholic . he meets an attractive woman who agrees to watch his grand-daughter so that she can make enough money for him to leave . he moves in with her and he has a terrible relationship with his wife ."|0
That this film flopped at the box office, and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - yet somehow rather appropriate. The commercial suicide the Monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on-screen. To destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome American alternative to the Beatles is courageous to the point of rashness, as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality.|1
Chucky 's back ... and it 's about time ! This time , with the help of Jennifer Tilly and her incredible design team, we bring you the most beautiful, functional and durable dog bed ever made ! Chunky is proud to present the Chunky Big Dog Bed . I know this is a bit early, but there's a good reason. Chunky has been working on this design since it was first conceived. We are really excited to finally share it with you and are very excited to see what you guys think of it. I hope you'll let us know how you feel about it.|0
I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally).|1
SPOILERS BELOW`A Dog's Life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other movie from 1918, `Shoulder Arms', the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated set pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker gets flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can execute his gags most successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses up as a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness.|1
This movie felt so real. I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy like Rory so what you see here is exactly what I've actually felt myself. Some won't believe there ARE disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them.The story is great. For a drama, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I was never bored, maybe partly because I was seeing stuff that is close to my heart.|1
Some days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.Therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of affluence does Italy give to these poor people? How ever do they regard us as the Land of Plenty? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer.|1
If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost ( for many years ) gem , I'd highly recommend giving it a try ! It's very well made , and sounds just right ! Great for background music or a solo instrument , just play it on it's own ! The only bad thing I can say about the thing is that you will find out very quickly that the sound is just not loud enough , and if you are lucky enough to have a really good sound system , the volume will never be loud enough .|0
This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film ( which is excellent ) . It borrows a couple of scenes and features some very funny one-liners . But it does not have the energy or the heart or the humour that made the original film . It does have an interesting plot however , and has the potential of being a better film than the original . The movie has been dubbed into English , French , German, Spanish and Finnish . The subtitles do not make the film easy to watch , as there is a lot of subtitles in each language .|0
I 've never seen the original `` House Of Wax '' so I really did n't know what to expect. As you can see, there's still a bunch of characters that I would like to see and some things that they do that I like. I really did n't expect this much information in one book. What a lot of things there are to see. I guess that I didn't get the full picture. But, it is really a fun read and I will probably get into it more in the future. Good Job!!!|0
`` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is one of the coolest Italian horror films I 've ever seen , and a great example of how good Italian exploitation cinema can be when handled with style and care . director Giuliano Montaldo and writer Vincenzo Salemi ( who wrote the original story ) are at the top of form here , taking a well-worn story and making it fresh and scary . torturing a young duckling isn't new or unusual in film history , and it isn't unique to this story . what is unique is the way they handle it .|0
The `` old dark house '' sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the films that inspired it. But there’s some good to be had there, as we discover in a re-review of the film that was made first. That film was _The House That Shadows Built_ (1928). The script was by Bess Meredyth, the wife of a film director with the same name. This film was made with a small budget of about $4,500 and was based on a true story.|0
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna, and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. The animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy.|1
"I have to offset all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need a pick me up. Granted it's not like the Sound of Music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. I adored the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in ""The Boyfriend""."|1
In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and Granny, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. Sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow fire! I'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by Friz Freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo.|1
As far as I know I 've seen most of Lucio Fulci 's films , with the exception of some Italian ones which are not available to me. But the way he made horror films was so different from all other horror directors , that I was always attracted to his style. And I think his style has evolved to some extent from that of his youth, where he showed a more direct approach to horror and a lot of violence. In this case he took some risks but he was successful with it. I think it is one of the most important horror directors ever.|0
I always liked this movie , I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it : ) . I know it's not for everybody but when you're in love with the idea that you want to make a movie like this , it's good for all of you . The story is so unique and beautiful and I think it deserves all of the success it has so far . The best thing of this film is how it was filmed . It really was a unique idea but it works so beautifully on the screen.|0
At one time `Buddy Cop' movies ruled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a T.V.|1
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel,I have to say out of all the shows that I've seen that ADV released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again,and that's when I got my chance. I bought the entire box set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th Birthday. And I got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that I missed on Action Channel,and the same 3 episodes that I've seen.|1
I went to the pre-screening of `` Rory O'Shea Was Here . '' I like this movie better than I thought I would. It's not perfect but it is really well made, well paced, well acted, and has some great moments in it. I have no idea what this means. But I'm hoping that it's an improvement over the last film, which was so awful and boring that I just couldn't get through it. It just seemed like a really boring and boring movie, with no redeeming value in it.|0
"The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen : much better and deeper than Luhrman's movie ""I Want Candy"". I was not expecting something so good, because in my opinion Snow Queen (or Snow White) is the worst kind of princess in literature. But I was surprised when I realized, that there is some kind of truth and reality in it. The plot of ""Snow Queen"" is so simple, and its execution is so great that I was convinced that it is a perfect movie."|0
by TyNesha Mells . In this drama , Ja Rule , who stars as Reggie , struggles with the loss of his brother to cancer. As he struggles to come to terms with his brother's death , Ja Rule is forced to go through his own personal struggles that include learning to accept the fact that life isn't as perfect as he had hoped. While it's a solid story , I don't find the drama to be as engrossing as I would like . In fact , with all of the drama going on in the storyline , I was having a hard time watching this movie .|0
"Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, clever, heady...it's hard to be articulate about something this good. There isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch- Myronex ""Putney, there's trouble in the black room!"" ""My name is Rufus."" The lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. ""Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!"""|1
"I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci's films. Most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining ""Zombi"" (which was a George Romero imitation), I didn't really enjoy them. I know Italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. This is why ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" surprised me. Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery."|1
Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie, was years earlier a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Don't Torture A Duckling. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town?|1
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution, although the war was nearly over by the time of its release. The tramp goes to war, humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the bum. It's a very funny film, although I don't think it nearly one of his best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his better output for First National before he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid.'|1
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see. The acting, writing and production values are top-notch. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. However, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. It showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. It is thought provoking and entertaining. Congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie.|1
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love film, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny, smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you.For those with a poor attention span, high expectations and no brains.. well.. um.. you may get bored and find things dragging at times.This is a charming, modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through..This film is a little gem.|1
"Exclusively for Coop's lovers, though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc. ), as an older man, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. After ""the end"", I did not have the feeling that I knew the man any much better."|1
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Granted I spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles I was able to enjoy the film.Can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings?|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story, Two Soldiers is a top notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. The story involves two dirt poor Mississippi brothers, one only a kid, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer Jonathan Furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go, and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the Army himself.|1
Lucio Fulci 's `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by poverty and crime. But if there's one movie to make the case for Fulci's work as the very best Italian crime-movie director of the early- to mid-'80s, that movie would be `` The Death of the Innocents ''--not just because of the plot but because he made one of the great Italian-American performances of the decade, and one of his best. It's also one of my favorite films of his, period, because it was also one of his best films.|0
Hey look, you don't watch this movie to change your life! But if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for Richard Gere; this movie is right up your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have on screen chemistry going way back. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not a Oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED good looking people (they don't make your stomach turn and even when Gere is 'on top' he does not look too jowly) then this is the movie for you.|1
These critics need to find a new job ! ! ! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY , so we should not be so quick to criticise, but to give a fair and objective evaluation based on what the movie portrays in it's context. So far I've rated it 2/3 and i will continue to review it as I think it deserves to be much better. I hope it is better that the last movie. There was a time when you could go to Hollywood and see the best movies ever made and just sit back and relax.|0
I thought this was movie was great, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with Richard Greico's character. They end up getting married and everything seems perfect except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, however she has a hard time trying to conceive. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy, and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the acting was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing.|1

Let 's be fair : there are no RULES for scriptwriting , so I wo n't say the movie SHOULD be like that but you can make up your own mind for the story line , as you want it. This is my first script . I'm a writer myself but this is my first script and it's all about the story , so I'll give it some thought and then I'll post the finished product later on. I'll do it in as much detail as possible . This story takes place in the near future .|0
I think that this short TV series, was absolutely wonderful, and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. This is definitely worth peoples money!I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the 'Blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life!|1
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. It's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on.|1
Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918 , a doughboy who can not seem to get the girl. Chaplin goes in search of his girl and finally meets her on the train, but he cannot make her his girl , because she is just a girl. But the boy does not know that he can find the woman that he never had the chance to see. It seems that every man wants to find the right woman. But the boy needs to find the right woman for the woman he is looking for is not easy to find.|0

Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes.|1
The revelation here is Lana Turner 's dancing ability . Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub dancer she was not particularly known for her dance skills, she was actually a terrible dancer in private life . It is thought that when the film was made a few days before she died she took her dancing clothes off to have a dance with John Barrymore . And she certainly was not the only famous person to have their dance partner strip off before a dance . A friend of hers once said that she always wanted to be a stripper but that she could never become one because she is a lady .|0
I loved this film ! ! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it on the big screen and I was so excited to see it on the big screen. As for the plot, it was absolutely amazing and amazing. I felt like I was in a movie in the theater watching it and I was in awe because it was just the right amount of intense and the right amount of silly at the same time. I was surprised at the amount of gore I saw. It was all done to make you feel as if your in a horror movie and not in reality.|0
I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind.|1
Loved today's show!!! It was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too.|1
This movie , based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt , is one of the best films I 've seen recently. The plot and the acting were so good. I was amazed how they did make the story a little more like the real one. The actors were able to do such good acting. One of my favorites of this season. The music and the sound made me cry. And it was all worth it! Go see this movie. It is so worth it. The acting by the main and supporting players are really good. The story was excellent.|0
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good. I have to admit Ms Cruz can really act. She puts on a very good performance. In fact she our does her boyfriend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself. I bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an Italian. However, I did learn something. One more chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany the many Italian soliders killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and Germany's eventual surrender.|1
The film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. I am the first one to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? Does every film have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Again, so what?|1
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.This music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises. It is about a land ""far away from it all"" where ""living things have room to grow."" Its people are ""living and growing together"" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age.The lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this ""world that is spinning around"" and to ""look inside yourself; that is where the Truth always lies."""|1
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon (""Action"") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon)."|1
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply wonderful performance. Diane Lane is so charming that she can take any man’s pants off, including Richard Gere's! She's been married twice to men who were not her soulmate, yet she's remained faithful to them. Now, after a whirlwind romance, Diane has decided to settle down. Then, the most unexpected visitor arrives. The woman he thought was his soul mate has left him for another man. How will Diane deal with this shocking turn of events?|0
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn 's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect of the Capitol, William Thornton. The film's main narrative concerns how Nathaniel, a man who does not know how to make a living in the world without his Architect's help, tries to escape the cycle of poverty for the betterment of his life. The story is interwoven between Nathaniel, William, and the architect's widow Elizabeth, whom Nathaniel's son, Richard, befriends when Richard is in his early teens. Nathaniel's search ultimately leads him to his own self-discovery.|0
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films , it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment . The film opens with us watching a young girl looking at her father's dead body . We cut to her standing by a window looking through a viewfinder . She looks so beautiful it breaks my heart , you can just see it , she is the only woman in the world that does . The camera pans away from the dead man and the girl looking out and we see a very beautiful city . We see a man talking to his daughter by the door .|0
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO , regardless of the age of the OAV . The plot and characters are both a bit weak and uninspired , particularly the characters in the original story. If you are a fan of the original series , there’s not too much that you won’t like here , but otherwise, I would just recommend this OAV as something you can watch as a fan of both series. The original story of the “OAV” is the best part of it, so if you want a better look at the story , go ahead and rewatch the series.|0
"I hope, from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne, Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it ""nearly turned me mad"" into a joy to watch.The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard."|1
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. I guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. This movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented.|1
Years ago when I first read John Irving's The World According to Garp, I was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. I experienced somewhat of a déjà vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Separate Lies is surely an age and experience thing.In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he a successful lawyer - she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer.|1
"The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 ""They Made Me a Criminal."" Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. Later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. And the whiskey.A problem develops when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose Bradfield's phony life on the front page."|1
I do n't see that much wrong with this movie . Granted , the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Antonio Scotti , but they are pretty good and the orchestra is great . I had the pleasure of hearing the movie in a private screening before a group of college students and it was really well received . I have seen more of this type of movie , but this one is better . A good movie, but the acting is so bland and the plot is far from original it's not even funny.|0
"If you've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu zinger! In 1933 Mae Questel caricatured Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip Popeye. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does her best ""Olive Oyl"" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. I kept waiting for her to say ""ohhh myyyy"", but instead it's ""something always happens to somebody."" The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny."|1
The show start out with the boat . Desmond was i it . Then they went to try to save him . Then he said that he just had to save his brother. Desmond went to find him. They get into an ice cream shop . They got on a boat , but then he left . After that he got back with his brother to try to save him . I love the part where he leaves the boat and is on a boat trying to find his brother who is being attacked . He gets to the boat , and there is his brother , in an attack on a man .|0
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London(England). Enjoyed it immensely. Although the Crow & the Chinese Policeman don't appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the Author (Writer/Director) voiced/played by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well.The rumour is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.Spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.|1
A beautifully photographed and paced short film . It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the joy of living life. It was filmed on location in the town where this family lives and was a pleasure to watch in a small town where we grew up. I enjoyed it immensely. This film is a must for any young child to watch as they grow. This film should not be missed. This is a touching film about two children from different backgrounds who are reunited and become friends during their stay at a family’s house for a short visit.|0
"* * 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert , Chad Michael Murray , Brian Van Holt , Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams . The last of these stars has had his star turn. He may be the only celebrity to star in his own porno parody of itself. I'll be back next week to make a long list of things that no one wants to write about right now, but until then, let's all give it up for Paris Hilton. It's a long one, but worth it:



Paris Hilton Is Back, and Her Life is Better Than Ever

She's back."|0
Being a middle aged mom myself, I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us. Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life herself. I am not a big Richard Gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk, but learns something about himself.Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies.|1
The movie is excellent . Acting , cinematography , direction and music are spellbinding . It seems to me that there are more people in this movie than this world . If you are a fan of good movies then I suggest you get this movie . There is a reason that I give this movie 5/5 . The movie was good. The acting was a bit boring, and the cinematography could use a little work. The story was a bit unbelievable. I am not even a movie fan, so I can't say that much.|0
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ""not human"" is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film."|1
It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's careers. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not Robert's. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def.Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat.|1
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the ""flowering"" of one of them. An embittered, ""Spike""-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings."|1
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar ! The film took a while to pick up from the start, so it's not often we get an extended trailer to give the movie a chance to make an impact. In this case the extended trailer is well worth checking out, because it makes the film look like something special. The extended trailer does, however, look like it's missing some shots, so make sure you check back in a few weeks to find out what went wrong with the film, and to see if we're gonna be seeing an extended edition.|0
"In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD ( I 'm expecting to see the My Mother's House movie on next Tuesday for example ) I'm getting a bit fed up with people who say "" DVD is not for you! "" . I've only bought one DVD for myself, and it's been a few years since then but the first thing I did when getting a brand new DVD player was to try the demo disc. The demo disc is just a disc of about 10 minutes of the film and then a few minutes explaining what the movie is all about."|0
"Better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of ""Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex"" to the Mel Brooks of ""The Producers"", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong."|1
This film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. These are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to America in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. They have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the United States which are disseminated on the trip over.|1
"it 's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight after a girl leaves one of them by accident (in the movie the friend who left her by accident happens to be a woman). This movie was one of my faves. And I can't forget the scenes in the subway at night in the cold and the scene where a woman hits her boyfriend. And of course the song in the movie where the character sings the song in the subway to her man. The lyrics are great: ""I can't get you out of my head."|0
"Years ago when I first read John Irving 's The World According to Garp , I was astounded that most critics thought it a ""bad"" novel. Now it is widely recognized that one of Garp's strengths is that he is able to bring to life so many of his characters. What's even more impressive is his ability to bring to life characters that he is not sure he has a real sense for, because he doesn't spend enough time with them to truly understand what it is that makes them tick or to fully empathize with them."|0
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800hrs) and I still watch it! I don't like the A-Team... I absolutely adore them!! It is just great to see Justin chasing the former members of A-Team. Brings back memories from the old days, when I was young an sweet. I would have given you a 10 for excellent, but Justin looks like he is chasing the former A-Team members all by himself. Of course, that is the only bad thing on this documentary.|1
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series. And, while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun, I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very best.The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts.|1
The Monkees , surprisingly , are a big favorite of mine . Yes , they might have been the original “ rock and roll” band, but they were also a major influence on the entire pop culture for the past three decades. From “ Monkees: A Rock and Roll Play” ( 1973 ) to their most recent album, the Monkees , there was always something new to keep them on everyone’s radar. It’s no secret that they wrote a whole bunch of their most famous songs on “ Monkees ” , a song I wrote and sang in high school during my freshman year of high school.|0
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it ( typical Malibu Barbie ) but the rest of the actors are just so good. I would never have guessed Paris is such a great actress. I was actually surprised. I thought I would get bored watching her but I found her very entertaining. The plot of the movie and it's ending was really good too. I didn't expect it to be so emotional and sad like I felt it was, but it was touching. I loved the way Paris reacted to her parents and her mother was a great character as well.|0
I just thought I would add another observation, here. While there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; there is a special, physically tender, moment, toward the end. When the Enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer.|1
Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage 's better films . He turns a fine performance as the singer in this tale of life , love and tragedy . He does have to do a lot in a small film , but he handles it very well , especially for someone who is so well known . When I read a review of a film, it is rare that I can't help but be drawn in . The same goes for the film I am going to be discussing , and that review is from a very reputable source .|0
I saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been sitting by my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking through the whole thing. He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted.|1

Great movie and very good cast

This movie was really awesome, Richard Greco's acting is incredible, he was amazing!!! I also really love the way he played this role. This movie is a must see on any movie lover's list. This movie was worth a buy on Blu-ray."|0
"Let me clarify that . This is not a `` good movie '' , but I am so glad it exists . It has everything a good movie needs:

- great actors- good plot- a good ending- good cinematography

And then there were four . Two had good performances, the third had great performances but was missing something, and the last two were just okay . I am happy they were okay . Now let me explain what makes a movie good . 1 - Great Actors

In this case we have three wonderful actors that have great chemistry between them."|0
This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to that movie. It's not only that it's funny and funny movies that are funny, the movie was funny and funny and funny and funny and funny. It was the best kind of movie to watch with your kids. It wasn't the kind of movie you have to sit in front of on the big screen, or watch in the theater to enjoy. And it was the best way to see a movie at all, with your children in the room.|0
Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums.|1
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary . I knew it was about child sexual abuse , which is one of the biggest crimes in our history . But I also knew this is a story that takes place in Europe . So what I was going to discover was a European issue . I had no idea what Europe had done to help the survivors of child sexual abuse . I had no idea about the role the EU was playing , nor that the European Parliament played an essential part . So what I discovered was amazing .|0

Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in ! I love watching him ! ! i hope he does more movies ! ! I am so so so happy i got to watch him ! ! I love Langella ! I love his movies ! I can’t wait to see the new one. Langella has so many roles to play! I can’t get enough of him! It’s been a very very long time, but it’s time to see Langella in theaters again, after what’s been happening lately.|0
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series -- my only detraction would be that I think it might have been a little overused at some points. But it worked very well for the story and it was very entertaining. As I mentioned in my reviews of previous episodes I think that the writing has improved significantly since the first episode. I would not hesitate to rate this episode 5 out of 5. As always with these types of episodes, I believe that it is best that the audience watch the first three or four episodes first to understand what the story is about.|0
I think it definitely is . The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language (who may not have any background in poetry) can read it on their own as if they’ve read a book of poems or novels. It takes me a while to get into the language, but I’m learning a lot from these books. When I first heard that this book was going to be released in October I think that I was pretty happy about it. I would love to be able to read them all in one go, if it’s possible.|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience.|1
This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies.For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself.|1
A beautifully photographed and paced short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does.|1

When `` Madame '' decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble . The snobbish Butler Edgar who takes them all under his wings is not the man to nurture the kittens. Especially the one-eyed kitty. When the Butler discovers what he's up against, he has no choice but to admit to himself that the cat with no tail may be a cat with a whole lot of hearts. Celibate or celibate are words used to describe men. But they can be used to describe anything in life that is contrary to the rules. The Butler finds that there is more than one kind of celibate.|0
This is one of Chaplin's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More opulent than the Mutual films, it continues Chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front.There is plenty of slapstick via the Limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree.By this stage in this career, the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves.|1
"I 've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was the film's producer it just about kills my enthusiasm. I suppose I'm one of those people who love the idea of Paris Hilton, and I can't help but think that the film had the potential to be more than just an extended episode of her reality series, ""I Live Here Now,"" and the reality that I'm talking about is just how ridiculous Paris Hilton is. She is the most ridiculous human on the entire planet."|0
Really , This movie should be released to DVD . I just got a bootleg copy of what I think it is and it is excellent . I don't think you will get the same quality of picture as you do at the cinemas. This DVD has a few more sequences and extras to it . I agree with you. I was looking for a BluRay disc of this movie on my local Blockbuster and they had it, but it was $15, and they wanted $20 to return it. I'll buy the BluRay if I get it, but for $15.|0
Even after nearly 20 years apart , the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing . In fact they've gotten better , and in some ways they've been better since the original band split. Black Sabbath is the original heavy metal band and their most successful album is still their best selling album. When Black Sabbath reunited they were the most popular band in the world. However, they had gone on several years without a new album or a tour. During this gap Black Sabbath broke up. But then they reunited and made an even better album than they did before.|0
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall its worth a view i guess, just watch it and u ll understand why its so famous, i guess ive seen it all and i guess i ll just watch some more of these movies and then i ll re-watch some more and then i guess ill watch the other ones and then ill re-watch another one and then i guess ill go home ive seen a lot of movies this year but ive not seen all these movies yet, maybe i shall watch all these movies later on this year.|0
A very weird , psychedelic , esoteric , ( and did I say weird ? : ) experience.But on at least a handful of occasions , I have wondered if the universe really does have meaning , if there is a meaning in life and if we could find it in a dream. This is one of the weirdest but most profound of my life, I feel it will be a part of who I am . It has been an enlightening experience and a great journey for me. I had this dream a lot in the week before and the dream has been going on all week .|0
Gary Busey's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography. Since had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see that fine actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well.An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Thankfully, Mr. Busey was Oscar-nominated for this, losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A fairly low-budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with GREAT SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope this made plenty of dough.|1
I 've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer , and I 'm very excited to finally have the opportunity to see it myself. It is such a simple story, which makes it all the more compelling, and if I may put it out there: not very well made. There's not a whole lot to like about the flick itself, but I find it very difficult to judge on its own merits, and that's perhaps the biggest reason I feel inclined to post this review.|0
"This is one of the best of the early `` Star Trek '' episodes , with Kirk and his crew doing a good thing. It's the second to last episode in a five season run and, while it has its moments, I didn't feel like it was any more than average. And I don't feel that way about the next two, either. When I first watched ""Encounter at Farpoint , "" as it was called in the syndication guide book, it was a revelation . I thought it was better than the movie, but I was never impressed with it myself."|0
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu , being Greek I adore my country and its culture but the most beautiful and scenic place I have ever seen is Corfu and that film made me feel at home like it was my second home. I also like the idea of being a young boy and going with my mom and sisters to see my grandparents house at a very old family home and then being a teenager and having to go live with my father, his father and other brothers and sisters.|0
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all.|1
"i did not read the book. nor do i care to. the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it. no, it was not a ""10"" film, but it was enjoyable. women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on ""in love"" and ""loving. ""also, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny. i enjoyed watching the developing romance. also, if you like Christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium."|1
No . I 'm not kidding with this one . He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave us his own personal opinion of the series and the show in general . I’m going to cut him right down the middle: he gave it 4.5/5, which is about what you’re supposed to give a show . And it’s worth your time. I think the big difference for me is I didn’t have time to watch The Sopranos when it started. And I don’t care for the show.|0
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family 's journey from the Old World ( Italy ) to the New ( America ). It is the story of the immigrant's journey to becoming American and the life they live in America. I have been looking for a new place to settle for years. I've tried to move away from home, and back to my roots, but have had problems with both. I have a close friend who is very supportive of my moving to a new place, but it would require a lot of money and would mean a complete upheaval in my life.|0
Wow , What a wonderful film-making ! Mr. Im has done it , again ! His last work , ChunHayang , was one of the best films that I've seen in years , in fact , I would have rated it very highly , as a whole , and I am still a fan of his work . In this film , though , he seems to have a new found love for the style of acting , and it appears to have been inspired in the same way as his previous films . The acting was quite good , especially for a foreign-film-actor-type , but this was more of an acting piece .|0
The movie is incredible , it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie . THe lines are memorable and you can tell right away the film will be a hit. It makes you want to see it again and again . The cast is fantastic , they give you an idea of what you'll be getting into as they take you on a trip through history. If you have seen the movie a couple of times you'll know the basic plot . It's a fun ride and if you haven't seen the movie , this would be a great opportunity to go and see it.|0
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a 'whodunit' for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid).Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a bit much, and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely dispenses to his students.|1
"The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!This film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. It knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the ""Child's Play"" series. It plays up the ""stoopid humor"" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing AT it, but WITH it."|1
Great movie . Post-apocalyptic films kick ass . This one is no exception . Kept up the pace and interest throughout the whole thing . This was more of a slow build than a bang-bang-bang action fest . What an awesome ending to this movie . The acting was top-notch all along , the special effects were great . The only nitpick i had was that I thought it would have worked better if there was an extra scene at the end with everyone on the way to their new home . Overall i would recommend this to any and everyone . 5 Stars .|0
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and Court TV can be relied on for a few every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.Both the brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame.|1
This is what movies should aspire to . Funny without being totally stupid , a little sexy without having every scene in the book , but with a great deal of intelligence and a healthy sense of humor. I had a great time watching this movie. It was funny, sexy and a great time to watch. It will be hard for anyone to beat the chemistry of this movie. If you're looking for a good comedy movie that's not just a comedy, and not just something that's just a mindless sex comedy , check this out.|0
These critics need to find a new job!!! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY, which has made history. It illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece has captured my heart and soul as if I too were there. The Blue eyed Cage & the delightful Cruz were amazing! Together they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. This movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!! !|1
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner 's mansion in Paris. Duchess, who is a very talented musician, plays the piano and the violin beautifully. This video shows her amazing talents! She loves playing the piano in the living room of her owner’s residence in a big mansion in Paris, while her three kittens sleep. Duchess is a white cat with a white spot on her chest, and a black eye from being hit by a car! After playing a few minutes, her owner calls her name and goes to get her a bowl of food.|0
I'm not going to go into too much depth, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it's moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was Trey Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell.|1
The Aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on IMDb. The songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but they weren't bad at all. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great piece of animation was O' Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.|1
First off , I absolutely loved this movie . As a Billy Crystal fan , I must say that I loved the performance of Crystal and the story he wrote . The only thing that I didn’t like at all was that the movie took way too long for me to watch it. It was about 8 hours of me waiting for Billy Crystal to take off his clothes and get naked in front of me . The only thing I like is that when Billy did finally take it off, the music in the background made me want to see him take off everything else as well .|0
I 've commented once on this Chucky great , but I had to do it again to say some things about him to his supporters and friends. When I did this , I was attacked with hate mail, threats, and insults, all saying that I wasn't worthy to speak the truth of who I really am. I hope that I am speaking the truth about Chucky, because he did a great job and created a great story, and did a great thing for children that have no one to show them love and acceptance.|0
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It's a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the Nashville record producer told him no. Buddy Holly didn't give up on what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie.|1
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers.|1
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino (""The Antichrist"", ""The Killer is on the Phone"") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror!"|1
Jack , Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond . His traumatic past experience of the White Whale has left him a bit shell-shocked, unable to cope in normal human ways. The survivors learn of a possible solution, a ship called the USS Enterprise, in the distance, but in order to take it, they need a boat. With no other option, they have to row across the open waters, in the middle of a storm. There’s no one to blame for this predicament, as we all get caught up in what we find ourselves to be doing.|0
"I first saw ""Signs of Life"" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.The direction is subtle and effective. I've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it."|1
Then again , I like Rachael Ray . She is fun , sweet , fresh , and such a joy for the kids . I wish I could be like that all the time . So when I am really bored , and I have to work , and my kids have no one to entertain them , I play games on the internet . I try to keep up with everyone , and I have a good time . . . . . . . . . But recently I have decided I have to go back and re-evaluate what I have on my “ To do ” list .|0
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from Sicially to the U.S. in the early days of the 20th century. It also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land.|1
"As far as I know I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now, and I would have to say this was his best ""pre-zombie"" offering. In fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died, I guess, it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch?"|1
This is probably my favourite TV show ever . I love all the characters , especially Alex , who is my favourite . I don’t think there are that many shows that have Alex in it . She has an interesting life . I also love how the show was written and directed . All the actors were fantastic . I think the first thing that I remember about the show is the song that was on every single episode . I thought that this is a show where you just sit quietly and read the words .|0

This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life , the action was great , and i really enjoyed watching all of the action . I would defenitely watch this film again and i will go out of my way to see it . I would definately go out of my way to see this movie one day , but not to see it again . I would have to go see it a third time . Okay this is the best film in a very long time, and not just that, it's the best movie ever made, no doubt, and it's one of my favourites.|0
As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films I have seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other.|1
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen! The images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning. On top of that, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end. You'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching TV! This series is available to buy on DVD and I HIGHLY recommend picking this one up!|1
Due to its predictable , second-rate title , ( the one it was distributed under in Italy , at least) this game has always had trouble getting the attention it deserved. We’ve only seen the barest glimpses of it, mostly on Italian TV, and most of the time they’ve turned us off to it just a bit too quickly, or just before it was actually finished. The same problem afflicts so many games on our list, as the Italian version of this one is a prime example of this phenomenon.|0
"Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good . I have to admit Ms Cruz and I have never really bonded over politics. ""Corelli's Mandolin has won Best Picture in two other categories. It was the runner up in both of those categories. It was not in the running for any other category, and neither was it nominated for any other category. In fact, it's the only category in which there were two nominees. I can think of only three films that have been so well-reviewed by critics in such a short span of time: Avatar, Avatar 2 and Avatar 3 ."|0
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form . I tracked it down and found some clips to watch, and then found a site that had a complete film on it on Youtube. If you watched the film a few times you will get it right. I remember when I was young, I watched the first few minutes and went 'what in the blazes' and then I had to watch the whole thing again. It just blew me away ! Here's the full film, but you have to pay a fortune for a DVD.|0
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight.|1
Ah the Outer Limits . I love that show . It was surpremely creepy , or down-right mysterious . I always wondered what made those people think they could survive . But they did . . . . One interesting thing I noticed was that most people who survive the apocalypse are either from some form of military service or from a family line that is well established. One of the people who survived was a man who served in the US Army in Vietnam. His wife was a doctor and his father was a surgeon. I wonder if he would have survived if he had stayed out there?|0
This is a well directed Columbo episode , with also some good character but the story just does n't really connect to the rest of the series . All of the main actors are fine and are very good ,but there is a lot of background work to get to a point where they do connect in the end . The story is very well plotted , with great twists and some great twists . The acting is top notch and very well acted . There is a good twist to keep you going until the end (the ending is very unexpected and well written ) .|0
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics.|1
This movie got better with time. I can't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this at the age of 15. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man.|1
I think that this short TV series , was absolutely wonderful , and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of how life as a woman can be. There were a few things that were a bit too over the top to get away with , but I guess that I could understand why the show's writers felt that they had to, or else the viewer might get confused or irritated. So I was left with the feeling that this was a fantastic show that was worth the watch . I have watched it several time now and always find something that I missed the first time round.|0
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local election, the Tories must be hoping that the Lib Dems will use their majority to take the seat from them. If the Lib Dems can't win in Staines, they will not be able to afford to lose any other seats at the next general election. The Conservatives have been able to get the better of Labour during the local election campaign in this election because Labour are not doing enough to get their policies through parliament.|0
"Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all, would it? Barnens ö, spelled almost like ""booné aww"" is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people, including myself.Children's Island is the title, and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's keen on breaking new records himself. In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.The story is, as most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring."|1
That this film flopped at the box office , and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today , is due mainly to the film’s lack of originality. There is, however, one major flaw in the film. If you look at the plot, and then add to it, a very simple but effective device which makes the film work. The movie is set in the era of WW2. It opens in Germany, and after two minutes the audience are thrown into the action. In this movie we see an English officer who has lost his son, in the war.|0
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was . I was right and I have been to see it over and over . I saw it at the movie theater . I would like to buy a DVD copy , I did not see it at the midnight showing and would like to buy a DVD copy because I don't watch it all the way through . I saw it on DVD a few months ago and liked it as a whole , but not as a series . I saw the end and liked them as people , I thought they were great .|0
Telling the story would n't be the point at all , would it ? Barnens ö , spelled almost like 'barens' , probably derived from the Old English āpēn , which meant 'far' . In any case , the tale comes from a time when the sea was open and there was a fair trade in sea-farers' tales , and was an oral tradition , which was preserved and passed on down from father to sons , in the tradition of the tales told by Pwyll ap Einion, King of Dyved of the Mercians , who ruled from 627 to 629 . 1.|0
A Formula For Murder isn't a well known Giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late on in the Giallo cycle, but more than stands up to many of the films released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. Despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes Argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters.|1
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I have lived here my whole life), I have waited for this movie to come out. And I mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.The movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and I smiled just as much.|1
Considering it 's basically low-budget cast , this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock legend David Bowie , who died from a heroin overdose in November. The story focuses on the life of an aspiring musician named Bowie , who becomes the toast of his hometown of New York in the s . The plot is very much like the real story of David Bowie , but there are several twists and a few surprising plot twists that made this a fun movie to watch even if you know the real story from Bowie's life.|0
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly ( 1936-59 ) . He does have a few odd habits in his movies that stand out from the crowd. Most people don’t bother with these things but they’re always there in a Busey film, which is one reason why Busey has been a favorite actor of mine since I can remember. He may not always have been good at being Buddy Holly – he could be annoying at times in some of his appearances – but he made his character very much his own.|0
OK , so this film may not have won any Oscars , but it is not a bad film . I would recommend it to anyone who loves horror or sci-fi . (Note: This review is from my review for the DVD, and my commentary from the DVD. The DVD will include both, but I do not recommend them together. There is no commentary for the DVD, but I will have a review on that soon. You may want to look at my review for the Blu-ray to understand why.) Let’s get some ground rules out of the way.|0
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years, and I can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick. I can't believe that Channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. It focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other.|1
"I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey(Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis(Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Ms. Davis says, ""I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make,"" to which Kersey deftly responds, ""Chicken's good. I like chicken."""|1
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old . I had no idea who he was at the time so my parents bought me a picture of him from the library. I was so entranced by that picture it was a long time before I thought to research him. When I finally found out more about him I thought he was absolutely fascinating and the story he was about, was so fascinating, that I couldn't believe it had taken me so many years to appreciate it. I was introduced to the story of Buddy Holly and the music that he grew up to become.|0
"I remember this film of old. It's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. And there are even stranger events taking place out back, in Hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. Yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including ""The Shining."" But the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly didn't see it coming."|1
I wish there were more films about middle aged people . The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of middle age have always fascinated me. There are so many different people from different walks of life and from different cultures who have made such a rich journey, and in doing so have provided so much inspiration to me in my life. This film beautifully portrays the journey of middle age in an entertaining way. The acting, direction, writing and performances are all wonderful. The movie has been released in a limited release and I highly recommend it for you.|0
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans . Okay I 'm sure it 's not as good as the original, it doesn't show the Chucky from the first film but it does give a different side of him as a good father who tries to be a great father by giving his daughter an education and letting her live life to the fullest. I agree with the other reviewer who said this movie is pretty bad but I still thought it was entertaining and interesting. It's basically a Chucky film done as a comedy but I still enjoyed seeing him as an actual father.|0
"These days , you rarely come by a kid 's show that does not involve 1 ) a preteen/teen pop star 2 ) an adorable child actor 3 ) some other pop star , or 4 ) a kid 's movie . There have been a handful of exceptions, but most kids shows these days have a lot of adult content (or none at all)

With the recent trend of kid's movies , there has been a lot of talk about kid 's movies with little or no kids involved. To my surprise, this is a trend that is not only continuing , but growing in popularity ."|0
This is possibly one of my favorite films . It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda ( Chelsea Peretti ) who lives with her mother ( Lily Collins ) in a big house in Berlin. Gerda dreams of one day having a baby and has a secret plan to have a baby of her own. One day Gerda's mother is taken by the Gestapo because she was a member of a communist organization that was supporting the resistance to the Nazis. So when the Gestapo comes and takes her, Gerda's mother tells her daughter that she's going to marry the man they were looking for.|0
I absolutely adore this movie ! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store the other day , but I went out and bought it . I really like the way that the characters interact and I really enjoy how it has a different feel than most action movies. I recommend the movie to everybody ! I really enjoyed the first two thirds of the movie. I am not a huge fan of horror movies but this film had a unique idea that made me really intrigued to see what came next.|0
I 'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci 's films . Most of his 80s gore films had their share of camp value but it seemed to me that, with The Strain, he took a huge risk with his latest film. He did what so many other film directors try to do and went for something totally different from what is normally done in this kind of genre. It was very different from anything he has ever done before. The film started well and I thought that was going to be enough to get people talking but I couldn 't help but to think, 'what if he 's doing something right?|0
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. It is just not available and it has not been on TV for many many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. Also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.My 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it.|1
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004 's Academy Awards , My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to discover the secrets behind one of New York City's most notorious criminal architects. After an intense investigation of Kahn's career, we see the young artist struggle with the past and his present, as he attempts to reconnect to his roots and to the man who saved his life by giving him a new beginning. The film was originally intended to be directed by the late Michael Radford and featured in a feature length documentary about New York City, but it was never made in its entirety.|0
"For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something , and who appreciate a farce that is cleverly designed , let us all take a walk back in time with this story from the 1950’s and the early 60’s. Here are some quotes from the film and some quotes from the book. From the novel, ""The Day The Earth Stood Still,"" the first quote is in paragraph 1 of the opening chapter. When I first saw him, I felt a sudden rush of love for the man, who in my eyes was a hero, a man I admired, envied and respected."|0
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London ( England ) . Enjoyed it . .Enjoyed it . Saw it last week. It is now on DVD. There was one minor problem I found with it . There is a long shot of a family with the kids in matching t- shirts . At the end, as they are exiting the theater, it shows one of the little girls wearing a T shirt with an American flag, and there is another American flag t shirt on the father. The American flag is on both shirts.|0
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. After the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since Bringing Up Baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it. Not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish-fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better.|1
Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful place in the annals of horror film history. His style of filmmaking has had many admirers over the years, from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino to Wes Craven and John Woo. Fulci is the author of several books himself, including a collection of short fiction and essays. The following excerpts from the recently released posthumous The Best of Lucio Fulci reflect on the filmmaker's life and work, and in doing so, shed light on his unique style of filmmaking and his unique approach to cinema history and aesthetics.|0
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on earth. The video starts out with these beautiful underwater photos of the Great Barrier Reef which is also one of the top 10 tourist attractions in the world. From this we go to a short film on how coral reefs are dying off and being overfished by commercial and recreational fisheries. In this film we can also learn about what can be done about these threats and the best way to do it. These types of films should be mandatory viewing for anybody interested in the health of coral reefs.|0
"This version of ""The Lost Horizon"" is actually not a bad film at all. I think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. Sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all."|1
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie. I caught it last night on TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the ending. Image what a Marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all dropped LSD.Funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. I had to be up at 6:00 am and watched it until 2:30. I over slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it.|1
"It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It memorializes the NY city mind set of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, hoist by by own petard, and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they ""really are""... I don't think it is ever shown anymore. If so, surely someone would Tivo the thing and put it out there."|1
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill Max with some insane cackling. The writing is the best. I was glued to the set when this would come on when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made I would be forced to buy it. This and a Conan the Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss the most from childhood. I think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons.|1
Charles Chaplin 's 'Shoulder Arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over two hours, the length of a standard feature film , it was hardly a full feature . It is, however, an essential document of the silent cinema, and is, in fact, Chaplin's first film in full colour . It also contains the single, most famous, and certainly most popular shot in film . This is an image from the film, and a single frame, in full colour , of Chaplin .|0
When I was 10 ( currently 14 ) , I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would be bad , I wanted to be the only person who enjoyed the film . it was the same for a lot of these movies , just that I was able to get a handle on what I thought , so I didn't know how bad the movies were , until I saw them . some films are just like that , you never know how good or bad they were , as long as you enjoyed the ride , it doesn't really matter .|0
I love this movie , though I do n't like how they picture Egyptians , being an Egyptian citizen myself. Thats just not right. I mean, if you have a lot of experience traveling around Egypt , you can not be a foreigner in Egypt at all. I think this movie just wanted to make Egypt into a country that's so big , there's no need to have any type of foreign population in the country. Just like America has a lot of people , I believe Europe has a lot of people , too. That's just how people like to see it .|0
This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a John Hughes movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable's scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day.|1
I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies...She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair).|1
This is one of Chaplin 's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more ambitious productions he made for Selznick from 1927 until 1932, when he moved to the studio he would own, United Artists, during the war. It was also one of Chaplin's first screen collaborations with Stan Laurel, the man he hired as his assistant in 1929 to produce his own shorts and to assist him in many of his films of the time, notably _City Lights_ (1930). Chaplin makes two great contributions to the story here.|0
I just thought I would add another observation , here . While there are a couple of visual sub-references , there are also very few in the text that can be compared directly with the sub-references . There are also some more specific references that have more in common with the visual content . And the most important of these are the following . While it is obvious that the visual content should be taken into account even more , there is a second aspect that is much more important . There is a relationship between the visual and the textual content . We will discuss this second aspect in a bit more detail later.|0
"When I first saw this movie,I also expected ""our boys"" to be cute,and more like an extended version of the TV show. I didn't ""get it"" back then. But,years later,at a party YEARS later,at a 70s' type PAR-TAY,where certain substances had been smoked,inhaled,and with plenty of tequila,""HEAD"" was on late at night.We watched it,and finally realized what ""HEAD"" was all about. It spoofed their own show,as shown in one song that called themselves,""a manufactured image""."|1
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in the making, one would be hard-pressed to expect any less. I did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones, which is naturally only a minor gripe.David Attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative, leaving enough room for one's imagination, and well spaced out, so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery.|1
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families and embark on a trip to the United States. Once they have arrived, however, they begin a search for the perfect American woman who will help them achieve their American dreams. The film’s most notable achievement is the skill with which it manages to humanise all of its characters, from the young men who dream of finding “The One” through their mothers and fathers, to the African women who will be tempted to leave their own country for the chance of a better life.|0
"The best thing from the American Pie ""bakery."" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision."|1
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. I found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. This was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular.|1
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange . I was confused , sad , and a little mad at how the main characters behave , then i realized that the movie was a love story in disguise . It was a true emotional film that i loved and watched in one sitting and that i recommend to you if you feel lonely like me , or if you feel that life is a big joke to you and you need someone to love and comfort you . Enjoy it . It was an emotional and beautiful story.|0
It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD. I would most definitely purchase a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is, I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it.|1
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. The direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. While the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. The soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration.|1
I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion.|1
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie . But really all the characters are amazingly fun to be around and this movie is definitely a must see in theaters . The main stars and actresses are all super hot as is . I will not say more about this movie but I will say that it is a hot movie to see . The movie starts with a great story that you will not want to miss this movie . This is definitely a film to watch for sure . A very sexy and fun film .|0
An interesting look at the immigrant experience , told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this book because I have been fascinated by the way immigrants and non-immigrants have responded differently to being displaced. I think the way it is written that is a very important and important point to think about when analyzing the experience of being a displaced migrant. The fact that this story is presented with this weird imagery made me more intrigued. I am not saying this is good literature by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I believe this book is pretty awful.|0
it's a great movie for the whole family. i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure. i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy from her.|1
I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden.|1
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I 've seen in a very, very, very, very long while. I've seen this a number of times over the past 8 years and I'm in a state where I need a good laugh. I saw it at a theater with a friend and that was the first movie of the evening. I was on the verge of going to bed. I was very excited. I'm not sure exactly how to explain what I'm thinking here.|0
WTF!! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending?? The Notebook was good...but sheesh, enough with the depressing endings already. I'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable...but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days. Don't we already know what really happens in real life?|1
My favorite show of all time ! Yeah , I thought this was so cool , and Larisa Oleynik was my favorite . I was soo glad they used her in this . You can see a little of her when she was still a young teen in the commercial ! This is the show I've never watched but I've always wanted to ! I really like this show , it was very original , and the music was great , not too hard rock , not too soft . I enjoyed it . It's a really good show for the family , but it is not for the hard rock crowd .|0
"I 've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much ) and it is the best show on tv right now. It is not only the funniest show on tv, but the most honest and realistic tv show out there. When people tell me to make more people laugh I say, ""I can only make so much , and if that is all you want then go watch something else. But give me a reason to laugh, or else you do not get my attention""."|0
Like a few people I know , I came in late on 'Stingers ' ; not until 2000 . Three years later, I sat down with this wonderful band and began making the trek across the country. I went out to see them for the first time, in their first studio recording, a live set at the Ritz in San Francisco in May 2000 , the day before their first tour date . I was a little late, but then again, they weren't . I got to see them play, and I knew I had to go to the shows.|0
Enchanting . The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad . It 's all just so very charming . I enjoyed watching the movie . All of the actors played their roles well . I 'd give this movie . . . 9 out of 10! Lovely movie , I thought the movie was a very good one . And it's a very romantic movie . The only thing that can be improved is to make the love part more lively and more real . But if it's like this it's a really good movie .|0
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. ""Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life."" How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred."|1
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I 've ever seen . Not only it 's very well directed, acted , scripted and executed but it's also the best movie I have ever watched in terms of visual and sound design, acting and atmosphere . I think I've been watching it more times than any movie . I'm not sure whether this is the reason or not . The movie is great. The acting is good, the visuals are excellent. The story is not bad. The plot twists are awesome and unpredictable. The music and score are awesome.|0
I thought that the storyline came into place very well . I liked this movie a lot . If you like action movies this is one of the movies for you . The acting is good and there is no one who is out of place . The cinematography and music were awesome . The stunts were real and impressive . I liked this movie a lot but I found the acting in it was a bit boring . I thought the plot was good and I was happy with it but I felt that the acting was a bit bland and it felt like this was just filler for the plot line .|0
"I don't see that much wrong with this movie. Granted, the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly carry a tune. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I happen to love their songs, especially ""The World Is A Circle"", ""The Things That I Will Not Miss"", and ""Question Me An Answer"". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic; I disagree on both counts."|1
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos, it's just that we haven't seen as much of him as we used to. After his role in ‘Bend it like Beckham,’ I wondered how he was going to adapt into a bigger film role. Well, turns out he's very good at adapting and playing a bit part that has a similar look to his big screen roles - and in a much bigger way. So how’s this one coming along?|0
"Before I forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the ""direction"" in here, because it's really good.To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat."|1
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but the plot is very well told. The story is a simple but very good one that I enjoyed. And I have seen many bad ones of the same kind. And this is one of them. But I must say that this sequel is far superior than the first. The first part was good in a way but the 2nd is really bad. The bad part of this is that the script of this sequel does not suit the story.|0
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre . Set in Rome in the '50s, the plot centers around a priest who is killed in an apparently senseless murder. However, the killer is one of his flock, and he uses his power to get what he needs . The film is not nearly as bad as its reputation. It's a fun film with a great script and some great performances. Director Fulci also wrote, produced, and co-directed this film, along with cinematographer Sergio Castellitto.|0
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller-coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass up and says 'To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor.|1
In Tweety 's S.O.S , Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that takes him to the Grand Canyon . The movie is about learning to survive on his own. The film adaptation of Sylvester plays out on a cruise ship for the better part of a year, where Sylvester is thrown into life on the boat without knowing where he is or who is around him. He tries to find some stability and direction, and to find someone he can be comfortable with on this new adventure. So how does the movie handle the question of survival?|0
"1930 's comedy mystery about `` The Crooked Circle '' a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the destruction of a small town and a man's career. 1935 's musical-comedy movie, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" is set in Emerald City, which is the home of the wizard, Glinda, and her helpers. 1942 A film adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's famous novel, ''Kim,' is based on this novel. 1947 The first picture to be released under the title ''King Kong'' was shot at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood."|0
Barbora Bobulova 's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time .I love the character of Valeria as she is strong but also sweet and gentle and a true friend to her and everyone who loves her . I also loved the way the characters interacted and acted as well .I would love to see a sequel to this story where this lovely lady will have her day in court and fight back against the evils that have invaded her life . I do hope that the story will see the light of day soon .|0
There's no point in comparing this with the original series. Though different in look and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, an SF/horror anthology series. Due to indifferent scheduling in Australia, I've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The very first episode really did give me the creeps (nightmares at my age ...!) but a number of others did fall flat; generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from SF. I only hope the DVDs reach us eventually.|1
At first I did n't think I would like this movie , but as it progressed it became better and better. I thought it was really well written , not too long and the story flowed from one to the other very well. It was written in a very smooth manner and could have been cut out more , but I understand this is a movie that has to make you think about it for the time that you are there, so it is hard to do. One thing I did not like about the movie , is the ending.|0
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci 's reputation as a director . Too often he 's regarded by horror movie lovers as a horror auteur , but a good deal of the films he 's made would have been made much more successfully by someone far less talented than himself. The films I think best illustrate this are his earliest, such as Death Trap and The Cenotaph, but it's hard to think of other films that aren't quite as memorable (or at least far better remembered) as The Beyond, The Reptile, or The House of Torment, all of which he also wrote.|0
Can the intensity of a husband 's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime , despite the obvious consequences to her and to himself ? Can a wife's jealousy lead her to seek out an affair to destroy the man who caused her great distress ? These and other questions about marriage and jealousy are raised by a remarkable new book, 'The Perfect Wife,' by Susan W. Smith. A journalist who has covered the news, Smith takes us on an adventure of a kind that is rarely told in the family or in the home.|0
Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat ! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the cast in the film, the stars are on show and the fun is starting. I think it's fair to say that there's a good chance that the film will go into production in February or March, but as with many of the other films in the project it's very possible that it may well go into production in early March or early April. The film is set to premiere in cinemas from March 1, 2015.|0
"An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, strikes him down dead, and keeps driving. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a ""stiff-upper-lip"" attitude towards tragedy."|1
The cover of the VHS says it all : `` Without doubt , the most powerful movie of its kind in years.`` I don't have much to add to that. And, if I may so express an opinion, I'd say that the movie is a pretty good watch -- it has an excellent cast, the script is well-crafted and the direction is terrific, and the movie is fun, even if it's not really all that gripping. I didn't see the movie on its initial release, however, so I can't speak to the movie in any great detail.|0
I thought it was brilliant ! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down . Dwight was fantastic and made it all look so simple . It was great to hear them laugh about each other and the challenges in finding a job. It made you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Great job by all of you for making it all happen and for making me feel like I'm not alone! I was really excited to be a part of this job and to see what it was all about and how great it was going to feel!|0
"Valeria, an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference of being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a ""yes"", ""no"" or ""I don't know"". The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent."|1
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans. Okay I'm sure it's not as good as what the Child's Play movie were like, but this can get really funny and enjoyable, Chucky's laughs are hilarious. (SPOILERS)Now not one doll, but two, meaning double the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.If you have seen the Child's Play movies this would be a worthy film on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the Child's play movies before, this'll will be a new start.|1
"Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days . It was not a pleasant experience, but I do remember thinking to myself I want to be one of them. I watched it again last night, and to my pleasant surprise it is actually a really funny show. In fact it has been on for over a year, and yet I still haven't watched any others. The only one that is on now is ""The Simpsons"" which I have just seen once. It is funny, but just not what I am going to watch."|0
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see . The acting , writing and production values are fantastic . It was filmed in black and white , and it is well worth the viewing . I think it would be an excellent film for the younger generation . There is an element of fear in the plot , but you get a good feel of what the world is like from the film . It was made in 1951 . I saw this movie with my daughter . She liked it a lot . It was the first movie that our family saw .|0
"As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of Blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played their small parts well as well. Man, I hope in the future my wife ages as well as Miss Renee has.Moving along, this ""buddy"" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time."|1
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not A-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup.|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested.With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series.|1
"You know , people who make comedies so often forget it 's really ok to be outrageous . Well , that's us , right now , in a world full of outrageousness . And , we're trying to figure out where to go and what not to do . Saturday, September 29, 2013

Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. But it has a lot more. Thanks, Bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale.|1
"The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film.So, viewers take notice! Here, MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire.In ""Two Girls on Broadway,"" however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, ""My Wonderful One, Let's Dance."""|1
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film? Probably someone. But no-one, truly no-one, could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film.Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as shown to us right at the beginning, he has huge trouble communicating. So it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member Rory (James McAvoy) who can speak normally, understands him.|1
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Top 20 of my lifetime. I laughed more than I have since Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and cried more than I have since I saw The Notebook. If you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. It is real and powerful. See it and you won't regret it. I was reluctant at first and I only watched it because I had to do a school project about speech disabilities. But this movie is so much more than that.|1
Being American , I have not been exposed to this character before , which is good because some of you have no clue to what this is and I will try to explain . I will try to make it short and simple . Its about how you are going to have to change your life and start to live the American dream in order to make more money and not to have to pay your taxes . I think this is a very good article that can help people to change their life . Let's start with the main character .|0
i love this film!! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do. it kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it. there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40. i think Sacha barren Cohen was Very and i do mean Very good.|1
What a great film ! I never knew much about Buddy Holly , but was familiar with his lively and vibrant voice. I grew up listening to the Beatles , and was a big John Lennon fan . I always wanted Buddy Holly’s autograph , with the hope I might one day get it . After all , it took over 30 years for him to make his comeback . If I could give him a shout out in his name , I would like to give it to him : Buddy Holly for being a true icon . He will be forever remembered by many , including myself.|0
My favorite show of all time! Yeah, I thought this was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after Feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than I should. To me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!)|1
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II was the best in recent years. A group of British officers are taken on a secret mission involving a Nazi submarine on a voyage to attack a Nazi fleet off the coast of Egypt, but in an unexpected turn things take a turn for the worse. I would suggest watching this film with a small group. It is well acted but the movie does have some moments where the story can get confusing but that is not always the case in a film of this nature.|0
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie . She was only 19 years of age when she had the career that she did, she is the only singer I know of who has made it to age 50 . She was the first singer I heard that had her own style that was so unique , so unique I can still hear the sound of the music when I close my eyes . I think this movie is the greatest motion picture ever made . I am not only talking about her singing or acting . I think its about her looks and style .|0
"Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the ""Godfather Of Gore"". Fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. ""Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino"" aka. ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre."|1
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: ""Captain Correli´s Mandolin"", just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful. But there were saving graces.The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability."|1
"""Caribe"" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. However, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, along with a magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of them embedding the other, each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. The story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great, and for that we owe credit to the emerging director, Esteban Ramírez."|1
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title ""The Chaplin Review"".This was an odd film in some ways because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. This film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the US efforts in WWI. It's truly odd to see Charlie as the ""super soldier"" who single-handedly captures 13 Germans, casually and coolly shoots several Germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser himself!"|1
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it again. So I saw this film again today and found it even better than the original. I really liked the film very much. I've also read the book so now I have two films in my hands. I recommend the film very much. I can't give you more than 10/10 but you'll have to see it to know that! I think you've made a great decision with this one. It has all the good qualities that you mentioned and then a few things in addition.|0
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about an ex-Viet Nam POW in Laos who escaped, but I didn't know much else. In reality, I wasn't expecting too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during WWII and the hardships.|1
"Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) getting made CEO of a corporation after the white CEO dies (the white executives all hate each other and can't decide who should succeed the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization.I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! ""Putney Swope"" is the ultimate jab at America's power structure. It's the sort of thing that seems like it would have come out of Richard Pryor's mind."|1
i love this film ! ! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is trying to share with me. it is my favourite film ! and i will watch this again and again and again till the day i die ! ! ! ! This film has been one of my favourites. It is not one of the best films I have seen in my life and I would rate it lower than a 5. But it is a great movie. I would have loved a sequel with John Malkovich. He is perfect. A great film!|0
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative , but I loved this movie . I thought it was well done, I enjoyed it very much and I'm sure that the rest of the cast would have too. As far as the acting was concerned, I have to say it was the best casting I have ever seen on screen . I had a couple of favorites from the first ten cast members that I would not want them to not have their parts , and I would love for them to not be in my life .|0
I was n't expecting a great deal from this film , so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it . I'm not entirely sure what to think of it , but it seems to make sense in a kind of way . The film begins with an interview with two men in which one of them mentions that the film will have an ending where his wife dies . He asks the other man to promise him to let him see her before his death . I think this is a good way to end , I'm not entirely sure what to think about it .|0
I think this show was right on the money for me . I watched it over the plane but there was always time for other things. I just watched the latest episode. I must say I loved it. The show is one of the best dramas I have ever been in. I have only one problem though.. I don’t think it is really a romance drama. It is not like any other romance drama on tv. It’s a drama between two guys. You can’t take the show too seriously. It doesn’t have anything to do with sex.|0
"Just as in ""Columbo"" we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike ""Columbo"". It is William H. Macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. Constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his ""perfect crime"". William H. Macy fans will enjoy ""A Slight Case Of Murder"", as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities."|1
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog 's filmic work that is without a doubt on par with his best films: _Carnival_ (1982), _Aguirre, The Wrath Of God (The Inconveniencia del Greco), Nosferatu_ (1979) , and _Cries And Whispers_. The film opens with Dieter on a plane, waiting to take off. He sits on his throne, sipping his drink, staring out the window as he talks on his mobile phone with someone. After some time, a man arrives in the middle of the night with news about a terrorist attack in Milan.|0
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly ( 1936-1959 ) is a tour de force for biopics of rock 'n' roll stars -- a masterwork of pop culture who was the subject of two films and several books. Written and directed by director Richard Maltby and starring Johnny Depp as Buddy, the film presents Buddy as a musician in love with the world's most famous guitar -- a Gibson Les Paul copy. Depp turns in an exceptional performance as Buddy Holly, playing both his own music and songs by such great rock artists as Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnnie Ray, Bo Diddley, and others.|0
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick. But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.'|1
This is a brilliant film. The story starts off in Romania,where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. There is a really funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river.|1
"This version of `` The Lost Horizon '' is actually not a bad film at all . I think the director had good instincts and was trying to explore his themes with an intelligent screenplay . It was one of my personal favorites , and I thought I'd share my thoughts on it . . . The Lost Horizon (1946) ""It's an extraordinary film noir with an excellent screenplay by Edward Dmytryk . It was one of the few movies made during the pre-Code period that had a strong moral undercurrent . . . It was based on a Robert E. Howard pulp story ."|0
I never thought I'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad).|1
"Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time. It has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby ""B"" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. In the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school."|1
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice . I read through them and can't see anything that didn't thrill me. I have been to Barnens ö three times , twice with the family and once with my mother in law , and have been a fan ever since. I'm sure there's more to come . The first night we had a wonderful time . The food is superb and the service as good as anyone can ask. We are now going to visit them once a year for Christmas .|0
The writers of lost have outdone themselves . Season two 's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the last episode. Every Lost fan is going to be crying during tonight's finale episode. But I'm not crying. I haven't. I haven't yet. I've watched it twice at home. But when I saw Lost's finale last week, I cried. I watched Lost with my mom because she'd been watching it while I was at school and now she doesn't have much of an excuse. Not that I didn't have much of one.|0
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from ! For some reason I have never seen it. But I have seen a few more films, one of them by the same director that is on my list. I just don't know when I'm going to see them. It looks like they don't want to let this go by without a review, so go for it, they can't be as bad as they are getting a lot of flack. It's a good movie, I liked it.|0
Indeed , Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond . Though I 'm just wondering how this was possible . After watching the trailer of the movie , I was shocked to see that Desmond was actually playing himself and Elizabeth was really playing the role of him . But that was just my personal experience of watching it . I 'm sorry but this is still one of the best movie I have watched in my life and I hope I get to have the privilege to watch the sequel . But if you haven 't seen the original movie , go watch it , because it really is fantastic .|0
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? No? Well, then, let’s move on and tell you all about it. And we’re not talking about the plot here, we’re talking the characters. It was just a movie, right? Yeah, but let’s take it from the beginning and just talk about them. Let’s talk about them in all their glory. Let’s start with Tim Thomerson.|0
I always liked this movie, I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what was that :P They don't look that way in Romania.. Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. And there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. It worths being seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love.|1
"Ah the Outer Limits. I love that show. It was surpremely creepy, or down-right mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I must have started watching way after it got canceled, when Sci-fi showed it as re-runs, or played marathons of it. It was a really good show, I don't know all about the seasons and everything but I do remember that every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV say: ""There is nothing wrong with your television."|1
"As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I adore AristoCats. It is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the ""best"" kids movies these days. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing."|1
I really enjoyed this film, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobbys and show them as people with emotions. As this film needed to show Bobby as a cold and vindictive person.I agree with another review it was sick love, not true love. He didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together.|1
Made at the height of the Black Power movement , this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope ( Arnold Johnson ) as a hero, who becomes a major force in the world of jazz music. In the 1950's the jazz scene in the United States was dominated by white musicians, who had a huge market of record buyers for their music. For some reason, this market had no competition from African-American musicians of the era. In other words, white jazz musicians had the upper hand. This led to racism and exclusion, with black musicians playing second fiddle.|0
This is one of my favourite Disney films. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way.|1
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh: as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute TV commercial about dandruff! See: the 50 foot Victor Mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film! Hear: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell Davey Jones ""Your music is awfully white""! Experience: the Monkees' only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: as Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father!"|1
"The ""old dark house"" sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. Here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he must die that very night. Meanwhile the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs."|1
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time . Top 20 is the best movie on here I have seen in a long long time and its the best movie I've ever seen in my whole life . It's very interesting as well . It makes me realize that I really have been living a life I shouldn't have lived . It really made me realize how stupid I've been . It really made me realize my self worth again . This movie truly is one of the best movies I've ever seen .|0
"Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode , THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode yet . it is an excellent episode and probably the best since "" THE MASSACRE OF THE FEMALE REPUBLIC "" . I think that episode had its moments , but it definitely had its weak points as well . the episode starts off in an odd manner in that our heroes get a tip that their target might be on a cruise ship somewhere in the pacific ocean . the only thing is that there is no such ship ."|0
I 'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it 's absolutely everything you could want from a horror flick. Sure, there are some moments that are quite predictable, but the overall story is really good, making it easy to overlook the few flaws in the script. If you are looking for an entertaining horror flick for the whole family, then this is the one that will do the job! The story is really simple. A few friends decide to have a get together at their lake house. They go to bed and are awoken to a screaming from the other room.|0
"I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film so much as well as the songs that I went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learnt the songs off by heart, just as I did with ""The sound of Music"" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager."|1
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian cinema aficionados (from Mumbai). In the movie, a young girl, Ritu is forced to move to her new city to escape her evil step-mother. While her step-mother is on a trip abroad, Ritu is left in her place with only a father and a little brother. While her father is away on business, she is forced to take on the role of housekeeper for the wealthy family that owns her apartment complex.|0
"Without going into any details of a good ... if a somewhat provocative ... TV movie , there seems to be little doubt ... about who is most at the centre of the plot. No other character is so central and so central that we would not forgive them for anything that happens to them, and the story does not spare them, not once, of being involved in anything, either good or bad. There are some moments that are so funny, that one is inclined to ask ""how come he didn't die from laughing"" but in the end I don't think this is a movie."|0
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the U.K. on Oct. 30, 1961, and has become an extremely popular cult film. The movie is based on a story by Richard Matheson, an author for whom the U.S. government awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1949, for ""The Night They Arrested Charlie Parker,"" a novel set in Harlem during the 1960s. The story takes place over a period of several months and was based on interviews and a diary kept by Matheson's father."|0
A mix of 70 's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line . As I 've noticed many of my friends who do this sort of thing are not a big fan of most things in life. Some of them take the attitude that because they find something boring then they do it better. I personally have found the opposite is true and if you find something boring I think you should try to make it more interesting in some ways. This was a fun book to read and one that you will never forget.|0
"I absolutely adore this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in it, so I figured it had to have some worth, you know? I watched it the first time just shaking my head . . . huh? Then it was the last scene and I found myself aching from smiling so hard. I clicked ""play movie"" and watched the whole thing again. It is without doubt the quirkiest movie I've ever seen. But the more I watch it, the more I love it."|1
`` Back in the Day '' is an interesting , but flawed effort . Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, who once worked as a police officer, but who, after retirement, takes it up again after his son, Reggie Jr. , was killed in a drive-by , and his partner is murdered . But when Reggie starts having nightmares about his past, he starts looking into his family background . He learns that he was arrested for murder years earlier , but was never convicted . As he investigates, he finds out about a series of murders connected to a missing girl.|0
The Aristocats is really quite charming , and is rated far too low on IMDb . The songs are n't all bad , although there is one that I found quite annoying , because she just doesn't care . It is a shame , however , as the show was really good , especially for children and adults alike . I haven't heard the songs, and the show isn't available on DVD, but the Aristocats has been renewed for season 3, so you might be able to catch up on the show in the meantime.|0
"The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink. This is the third image in what becomes a sequence of many. It begins with Buddy, wearing a dark suit and sitting on a low stool at the rink with a girl beside him. The girl says: ""I love your suit. You're so dapper."" ""I'm so glad to be seen with you,"" says Buddy. She smiles and puts her hands in her lap. Then she puts her head on Buddy's knee."|0
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in! I love watching him!! i was 10 yrs old (1979) when i seen him for the first time.i eagerly await each and everything he'll be acting in. hopefully one day i can see him in person. he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning!!!! In my opinion he is the greatest actor iv'e ever seen!|1
`` Showtime '' is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro ( Meet the Parents , A Bronx Tale ) and John Goodman as a father and a son, respectively, who get into an epic battle of wills over the woman of their dreams. In ''[[Film/MeetTheFaces The Misfits (TV Movie]]),'' [[Franchise/StarWars The]] ''Film/StarWars'' cast, including Mark Hamill, Anthony Daniels and Peter Mayhew, star as a pair of bounty hunters who must work together in order to stay alive and out of harm's way in a galaxy far far away.|0
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! Hat's off to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. I watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. This film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world.|1
Valeria , an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and loneliness. When her father goes on a trip to Italy, she meets with a mysterious black-haired young man named Eluard . In this new novel , you will see how this young man enters a world of mystery and intrigue. This novel also talks about love, sex, and death. And the story ends with an unusual twist that you have never read about in the history of novels. This is a novel that all the people should read!|0
If you have n't seen this film , do it . Its a genremix as i 've never seen another like it. This movie is a movie for everyone . It takes us on a ride , with all types of movie goers , from children to elders . And it is fun , for both the adult and the kid . I have seen many movies that are a mixture of genres , but never a whole movie . If you have never seen it , do it . A good movie for people of all age. And if you have never seen it , it is a great movie for you to start watching .|0
I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place. The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. I loved this show from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!|1
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and for about as long as I've known his name, I've also looked for this movie. I tried looking for this movie all over California for over four years. this past summer i took a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, I bought it and watched it in France! I was blown away, it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen Luc Besson's first work.|1
I still can't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site. Such a rare movie, so little spoken and known, is difficult to find, even to fans, but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating: now I hold a DVD of the movie, with the finest quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought by the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and marveled at the experience. I didn't know what to expect.|1
I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon . I loved the film but found it hard to get into it and it didn’t make the cut for my top ten of ‘the best musicals ever made’. The story was quite good though, and it did a great job with the music. But I did not find it the most entertaining movie of the year, it was, at the time, just too hard to get into. It’s only now that I realise how much of an impression this movie has made on me.|0
"When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.The force of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings."|1
"What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' only naughtier. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde. The one scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: ""how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter."" Jekyll replies, ""but sir, I'm going ahead with the operation. ""Lanyon replies back, ""oh."|1
"Anyone who has seen Ali G before , should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse'. I am not saying this film is a good one but it is just an entertaining movie with great actors that will please any action and comedy fans. There will be more of these films with Ali G as a lead actor in the future. I hope to see more of his work and I look forward to seeing more films with Ali G on the big screen. The movie "" Ali's House "" was also well received, and the actors did an exceptional job as well."|0
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love.|1
Another enjoyable Warner flick . I really liked John Garfield in this , though I 'm wondering why Cagney was replaced by a character who is so much older and yet looks more like him ! I'm a big fan of The Man Who Fell to Earth, though I have always been a fan of MGM films and never knew it was one of those MGM productions. I thought it was good as long as it had its good bits and had not become too melodrama. I wasn't surprised to see that a lot of it had been done before.|0
As with so many modern US films , there has to be a supernatural element to the plot , but , in the case of “In the Name of the Father ,” the “ghost” that appears to our protagonists is something far stranger than anything that might come out of a horror film. In many respects it represents the ultimate horror scenario: an ordinary person (John) who sees and experiences the supernatural. In many other respects it's the ultimate comedy : a woman who sees ghosts becomes a world-famous writer (Sarah).|0
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock, Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage angst.This easy to watch bio is not without flaws.|1
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert . A brutal but beautiful journey that explores the darkness that exists inside of us, our fears, our fears and our true self. What is there that we are afraid of, and that we cannot live without? I hope this story will be a wake up call for anyone that has ever been a victim, that has ever been a slave, a slave to fear and it is a journey through the darkest parts of humanity that will teach you the most important truth about who you really are.|0
I remember this film of old . It 's a great , chilling , atmospheric horror picture about a man haunted by the death of an old friend. It was my first horror movie , i 've only ever seen it twice in the cinema , and i thought i 'd seen it every time it came around. The first time i had seen it was years after i had first experienced the death of a friend. I went back to the cinema and sat the seat that he had sat in front of my first time i had seen it .|0
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic lines, and it shows why so many Americans are ready to embrace socialism. This film has a good chance to become a landmark event for American history. We all know that socialism and communism in America is dead. But with a film as this one, it will become even more real. And, we will not be able to stop this great film from changing our world and the way we see things around us. This movie should be shown in every church and every school in America.|0
Is this a good movie ? It 's hard to say -- but in 1953 , for many people , this was a movie they would never forget. I just watched it again -- and it 's a movie that 's hard to forget . It was a very funny and touching movie , and a movie that I still find it hard to describe. I 'm writing this in the early morning after having had a very late night the night before -- and just woke up and sat down to watch this movie again . And I really had to remind myself to write this in the morning.|0
He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song , and now the terrific Justin Bieber is back to try and get back into the top ten. In this case he's only going to get better, and if he's going to get a number one then he has to work harder than ever before. For me there is no better place to be right now than at No.1. I'm here for the love of it. There's no better way for an artist to go from the bottom to a number one.|0
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy.|1
Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot!|1
This interesting film noir features three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick, and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. Demming, as the detective, is unfortunately not nearly as good. He lacks the intelligence, strength, and cynical world view of a Bogart. Had Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic.Pace, location (a library), and atmosphere are all good. But there are a few plot holes. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless organization (Nazis) he represents. Yet after mistakenly killing Blackmer, Sanders seems to experience no anxiety or remorse.|1
I ca n't get this flick off my brain . It 's definitely totally different than anything that 's out right now in the theaters . it is so different because it has a very different style to it and it has very different themes , and it 's definitely a different movie from what's already been done . it 's a very different style and it is very different from anything that 's out now . i think people who don ' t like that movie might be saying , you ' re wrong , it 's very good and it 's a good piece of art .|0
This movie is truly a classic 80s movie ! A must have in any '80s ' movie collection ! Guns N' Roses are one of the bands of the decade !! This is a true masterpiece by director, Dan Aykroyd . This movie is just a classic and a must see movie . It's a movie that will never be forgotten . It's a movie that is a masterpiece . This is definitely one of the most amazing and beautiful movies ever created . Great music and a great plot . One of my favorite 80's movie . Great soundtrack by Lita Ford and the movie itself is awesome .|0
Loved today 's show ! ! ! It was a variety and not solely cooking ( which would have been fine if i knew what i was eating ! ) !! It was fun to have a variety of hosts and different things each one brought. I would have to be an excellent cook just to know what all they presented was like, lol. I will try to go back and check them out again but i am already on my way to googling different recipies. I have not tried any yet. I hope it is worth the money to pay.|0
I saw this movie on PBS the first time. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch it, I can get something else out of it. It's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like Charlotte don't want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is outstanding with all-stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy.|1
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title. The movie was cool,despite the fact, I hate new ones! All of the cast was awesome . It has great cast and an awesome plot!! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder , neat eh? !Dennis Quaid is the man who is ""D.O.A""(in other words Dead On Arrival).He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect! !Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him."|1
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore WHICH MADE It GREAT, i would see it 1,000 more times, and Paris Hilton, D*MN she fine in that movie. But anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) Adults like it to. You would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, IT IS AWESOMe, I CANT STOP BRAGGING ABOUT IT.|1
"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film ""The Enemy Below"" from the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer & German U-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars."|1
"Easily Lucio Fulci's most respected film, ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter, gruesome imagery, and strong storyline. Terror befalls a small Italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Someone else? Contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content - I consider it much more plot driven; featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards)."|1
I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.|1
This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title . The movie was cool , despite the fact that i thought the story was just a joke . But after seeing this , i don't know if the movie was a joke or not . Because the story is just plain funny . And the ending was too funny . The way the plot was going , it's like you can't take your eyes off the screen for a minute . It's like being on an amazing roller coaster ride , and you can't wait for the final descent to come .|0
This Oscar-winning short film ( 40 minutes ) , based on a short story by William Faulkner , takes us on a journey across the American West . It tells the story of two men, one white and one black, both on the run, on the run from their own past and from the law . The film's director, Robert Bresson, was one of the founding directors of the Cinémathèque Française. He directed this film as an homage to William Faulkner, the great writer who had written a series of eight novels of the West in which he set out his vision of American society.|0
I first saw `` Signs of Life '' on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation . It 's a wonderfully funny play. The author, George S. Kaufman, was born in Brooklyn in 1909. His first plays appeared in his teens. His first big success was '' The Dark Hand '' (1933), and then he got the break of writing for a Broadway play, '' The Manchurian Candidate '' (1962) . In all he wrote 12 Broadway and 15 television plays . He also wrote the screenplay for the 1962 movie version of '' The Manchurian Candidate . ''|0
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional.This film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about, what good design is, and the emotional price that is paid for it. Equally haunting is the sound track. If you see the film, and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening.|1
I loved this film , which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival . In March 2005 I spent two days and a night in the hospital after being run over by a garbage truck. I am lucky to have survived. This film is well worth watching , although I would suggest you see it with the sound on. It is a story of a man who survived an accident and of his life in the years following . The title of this movie refers to him being the man in the garbage truck.|0
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I've ever seen. Not only it's the mother of coincidence, but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction.Take this casualty for example, The US marine, whom gives Sayid the way to become a Torturer, Is Clancy Brown, playing a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he is playing Kelvin Inman, the Desmond partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh?|1
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history, someone had to be the first. One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre.Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. When you consider that some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope, Abbott&Costello, Laurel&Hardy involved military service and made during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at.In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours.|1
