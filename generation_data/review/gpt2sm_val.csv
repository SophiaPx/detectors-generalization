"`` Please , do n't kill me ! I 'm just an actor ! '' `` Can you play dead ?'' Why ? ""It's funny because when people talk about it, it makes no sense. There is nothing interesting that has gone wrong with this movie.'' ""I have always enjoyed movies of my youth. Now, I have to figure out how to take a picture and get it into my mouth. I don't want to live like that! You're going to be fine, but the only other option is to go in and pretend to be your neighbor."|0
This movie just might make you cooooo . The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town . Betty Crocker was an amazing actress! I wish that there was a way to have Betty Crocker look better in this picture , but this one doesn't get it. Her hair is too long, her outfit looks dirty, and her makeup looks very bad. You may not have noticed or liked this movie. At first I thought they were funny movies, but now I really like them. Some of the most outrageous scenes are actually funny ones.|0
Maybe it 's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel , or a fondness for that book as well.So... I'll say this though.I've seen this movie before and I remember it very well. The actors are incredible, they really come off at the end of each scene.. but there was never much emotion in the movie. It just made you feel sorry for your character.The writing here was horrible.. not good..and I loved every minute of it. But the plot was boring.|0
"There are many film now on DVD, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. Many people from my generation learn a lot about history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas, (The first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome seen many ""bad"" epics of the era."|1
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie . Amy Jo Johnson ( Susie Q ) is a great Actress . I did not like the movie. It was very funny and I didn't like that one, but it was ok. The only reason I gave this movie 8 stars is because it doesn't compare to anything else on this list!! The plot is awful and there aren't enough scenes in the movie to give the viewer any idea of its true nature. The first part of the movie consists of several women looking down on their husbands who seem to be losing control over them.|0
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football team. As he tries to find his life again, his girlfriend (played by Kristen Wiig) becomes obsessed with him and decides to kill her father. He discovers that she loves him very much and starts looking for a better job. Soon, she finds out that her father is actually a drug addict and has been murdered by a gang called the Gangsters of New Jersey. I am not going to talk about these films because we have already looked at what they are supposed to do.|0
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (4 February, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours."|1
"""Side Show"" is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer makes it out to be (The Trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). Also, the acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.8 out of 10Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks."|1
"Personally, I regard ""The Egyptian"" in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian movie commenter & critic named Bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. This movie fitted the Bill perfectly & I came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it, as I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.To me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production!"|1
"Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. But that's because it didn't have the FUNDING those movies had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on African American historical involvement (and NO, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), Hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make ""Posse"", just so that the story could be told. I think that alone is commendable."|1
I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim , California in 1982. The film, which was written by David Kiner, and directed by Jim Henson and Robert De Niro are both excellent! I didn't know that I would be watching a horror film because there were no horror films of the day until I saw this film. I never watched an action movie before to find out what they were thinking of. This movie made my blood run cold because it's like you're in a real movie where your heart is going to stop beating every second.|0
There 's a brand new killer on the loose , and he 's doing God 's work . Yeah right. At least it's not for you to blame. I've seen some great documentaries about this guy, but none have been worth the effort (I was lucky enough to see them all, and then I just stopped reading them because they had spoilers). If you haven't seen the film already, don't do this. It's too early to tell if there really is one, but the first thing I would say is that it's pretty good.|0
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her.What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).|1
"Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood, this isn't the sort of kid that you'd want to spend an eternity reading.

I had always heard about this great mini-series , but viewed it for the first time this week , July 11th. I didn't really understand why it wasn't aired on television and I am so glad that I watched it. Although I love the script, nothing beats the action or characters.This is the second installment in a long series of shorts that I have seen (in spite of their original name). It's not easy to judge something by how much it gets better. Even if you don't see what people are thinking, you can tell they're looking forward to seeing your show.|0
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!!|1
Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it 's rabbit season . But the most interesting part of all, in my view, is that nobody else knows how it's going to end.There's no doubt that this show was an incredible hit when its premiere ended in 1999. And yes, it would have been so great if the producers had actually taken some time to think over what really happened next. The premise was pretty straightforward: a cat (not her real name) returns home from work with a bunch of stray kittens on the roof of a house.|0
i love this movie. is it on air anymore? what can i do to get it on air again because i miss this movie when does this movie air again? i love this movie so much. does anyone know how long it has been since it was last on Disney?it has been a very very long time and i am so sick of waiting!i want to see Susie Q again. i swear, they take all the good movies off air and play new stupid gay ones that are fake and retarded.|1
15 Park Avenue , well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in it. I suppose this is a bad idea since there are plenty of other spots near the movie site, but not as close as we usually think they get. This film was just too much fun to waste my night watching. The characters are all over the place and you can only imagine how uncomfortable they would have been onscreen. There were so many great actors to work with. Unfortunately, there was something really wrong with the acting.|0
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest . In many ways the main characters are less than likable - but at least there are two interesting characters who make an appearance, both of them with their own flaws. I wish I could recommend this movie so much more to a younger reader/reader who doesn't know anything about cinema and isn't very knowledgeable about it...but I cannot say that it's good enough for me. You'll understand why as soon as your eyes start glazing over.|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the cliché cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was I wrong. It made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. I loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!!|1
"I saw ""The Reader"" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat."|1
"My kids loved this movie . we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie . we are all gonna look forward to seeing the first film
This movie is probably the funniest I have ever seen or seen on television so far and i don't say this because there is some real bad quality to this movie that i just couldn't catch my breath about. The only other thing that i can say is, if you aren't a fan of Stephen King's masterpiece ""The Shining"" ,this movie must be for you.If you love Shakespearean dramas then this movie cannot go wrong."|0
On watching this film , I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity in such a short time period. When I watched it to see if my expectations were exceeded, I wasn't expecting something so dramatic. The only difference is that the director did a really great job of changing the narrative without being able to convince me of what his intentions were as a scriptwriter.The story starts off as an ex-boyfriend of mine who is trying to get her husband back together with his girlfriend. Things start going very wrong and soon the couple ends up divorcing.|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. Central to the story is Xavier ( Romain Duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. He learns about life and love rapidly. Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. The rest of the cast also play well.|1
"It has been recorded that John Ford made the ""big, blockbuster"" movies so that he could afford to make the ""small"" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film."|1
Fuckland is an interesting film . I personally love the Dogma movement . I wish it had lasted longer . But not so much . It never got anywhere at all. I have made a lot of movies before but this is my favorite. This one has great pacing, good cinematography, and takes place around the main characters. At some point in time when you're looking at a large picture like this, you start to wonder why you are sitting there watching this movie with your eyes closed. Maybe you've seen it enough times before, but you can't tell.|0
"I first saw this one afternoon in the 80 's on network T.V . I think I was like 9 or 10, even though I was younger than that. It was very strange for a show to be titled ""Fatal Attraction,"" but it reminded me so much of what I have seen and experienced all over TV. And it has something to do with being too close to home for my own good. It was probably one of those cartoons where you just have to watch your best friend die while you're watching it. That's not really what this show did."|0
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80 's inbred/backwood slash-fest flick. The characters aren't anything special (except maybe that it was meant to be), they're just a bunch of people with a penchant for drinking. It doesn't really make sense and I'd have liked to see if we could get a better understanding of how they worked, what they did, and whether or not there was any kind of social justice agenda behind their actions. I've watched this movie a lot, so I'm trying to guess what you mean by ""bad."""|0
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! I enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ! OK the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! Some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films..|1
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be British, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. Not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended.|1
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really do n't approve of pornography all that much. If you enjoyed this movie, please enjoy the movie as a whole (if it weren't so bad it'd be worth more than its $25K). The plot is great and if I was going to get addicted to anal/bondage, i would not have watched it anyway. The title of this review isn't particularly interesting. In my opinion it is an abridgement of some pretty good porn stories from the 60s.|0
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney , Australia , following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Jack (John Cale) to get out of jail with his fiancée. We must watch this film as soon as it was released in 1991 and see for ourselves how these people behave. The plot revolves around a group of young guys who are taken hostage by a group of criminal gangs who want their freedom. These gang members have no idea what they're doing and can't stand to die, even if they do kill or maim them.|0
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . It was a long time coming but one can't really deny it.This movie has been going on like this for over ten years now.It's easy to tell when you're watching a film by seeing its cast, directors, producers, cinematographers. I've watched more than a thousand times in my life and have found them all hilarious and amusing. The jokes are funny - they always come off as too good or too stupid.|0
"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us..."" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery."|1
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enraptured in Orry and Madenline's love story. I am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie.|1
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! When I first tuned in to America's Next Top Model, I expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. I didn't. This show is actually serious fun. I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's Next top model. And it so does! Who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what it's REALLY like.|1
I LOVE this movie . and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore . I think they should have tried to use that in the beginning because it could have been better.It is funny at times but once you get past the last part, you start to get over-emotional.This movie is absolutely terrible. If you want to feel like you've been watching a musical, this is not for you.The entire movie starts with some bad jokes thrown out of nowhere. In this case, even if you saw it, you're not getting your popcorn from this film.|0
"After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was damn well worth the wait! ""Rush in Rio"" may very well be the greatest rock DVD in existence. I'm not joking. It's incredible! All the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. I find it makes you feel like you're actually in Rio watching the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're actually there."|1
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. You don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. The jokes are quick and unexpected.|1
After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite movies. I have watched this many times over the years and when it comes to new films I always get a different kind of reaction from those who watch it. Most of the time they simply see it as just another side-effect of something bad done to me, while others seem to find it very funny, amusing or interesting. The cinematography was brilliant and the characters did a fantastic job of bringing people to their senses.|0
This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we groaned. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time!|1
It's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring.|1
"I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch up on the whole thing. But if you have a good reason for feeling sorry for your fellow Americans, then why would you ever bother watching such a stupid little comedy movie? Well, there are two major reasons. First of all, it's an extremely dumb movie! And second, there is just so much stupidity in the name of ""humor"" that it makes even my friends cry. So I made this short movie because I really wanted to see some action in this video from the past."|0
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does n't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with some of the silliest elements yet. I'll admit that, if you've never heard of Robert De Niro or anyone associated with them before, this might be the one for you. There are two other Lone Ranger films in existence today (not even the original movie!). They're pretty bad as they were released in 1977, 1981 and 1983, respectively; each had a great premise and there were many laughs from the audience.|0
This film , released in 1951 , has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50 's . It is a retelling of another novel by an 18 year old boy who never left his home at the start of World War II, only for his father to turn on him.The script was penned by a writer named Alfred Hitchcock and consisted of five scenes with two actors. One scene is set in a war zone while the other takes place right before a big battle where the three protagonists meet in the ruins of a barracks.|0
Finally a true horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I am a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it is quite gory. I am not a big wrestling fan but Kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad I did. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough.|1
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio.Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take.|1
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is.|1
Style over substance . But what a style it is . `` The Cell '' is the internal version of the classic film from 1980's 'Cell.' The story is about a college boy with a very unusual talent who encounters his love interest at the beach. She meets him in the gym for a bath and becomes interested in his work. She goes back to the school after the fact, but she still finds out that the boyfriend is not really his true love. Then she runs off with the rest of the gang as they try to recover from their troubles.|0
"Come on. Anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. Anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch ""Huckleberry Hound"" episodes for 20 years straight! The takes and double-takes by the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film. Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon."|1
"Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I begin ? The years of hard work paid off in what is a very nice film. It doesn't really have anything to do with real life. But if you are paying close attention to it, your interest in the series might be overstated.If you like suspense movies, then perhaps you should consider buying this one, since it does not contain so much action.The script is simple: A woman is attacked by aliens and captured by aliens who are attempting to kill her. After escaping, she meets her ""real"" friend, who manages to escape safely."|0
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it. But there's something more to it that I just don't want to see. In this film, the cast are so busy making their best movies that they could hardly even come up with a story that would make a difference in the end. (I have to say, this movie is awful. Honestly, watching it has made me regret having watched it as an adult.) You'll notice that none of the three main characters are very intelligent.|0
"You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a ""story."" At first viewing, it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images."|1
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of Ford's 'stock company', including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond,and Harry Carey, Jr.Like almost all of Ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of Indians than in most of Ford's movies. Ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American Democracy.|1
"This was a pretty good episode. Though no ""Trapped in the Closet"" or ""Cartoon Wars,"" it had a lot of things going for it. The character of Al Gore and that bizarre-as-hell ""super cereal"" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman/Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake! ), and he comes within inches of his face."|1
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job Mr. Lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! Though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! Overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars!|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars ! I really do n't care what people can say badly about it. There is nothing in the story that makes me think this film is going to get nominated or anything. The acting was a little off so I have to see if it will be picked up next season! The first two minutes were very good, although there were also some bad language. The second half was a little boring and uninteresting. This movie should have been better. The only interesting thing about this movie is that it would have gone on much longer.|0
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain).|1
"George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis' campy ""Old Acquaintance"" written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a ""serious"" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition."|1
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.|1
I lack cable-vision and no longer have `` DirecTV '' . So being a rural resident I have to wait at least a week for these shows. But what is even worse about it all? You guys are so dumb. If they can just get this movie out, why don't they put it through another screening? I hate the fact that every time I watch an animated film, I keep wondering if it's really funny or entertaining. It has nothing to do with real life, but rather it's a parody of the cartoon characters on the show.|0
"That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera? ""The Best of Everything"" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of ""Valley of the Dolls"". I mean, ""Best"" has everything. Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase? ), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the goings-on."|1
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Americans in the name of their Godfather. They are led by an alien alien named Hideo (Tommy Lee Moore), but they aren't surprised when his face turns blue. This movie was one of those movies that would not disappoint.I've seen The Lone Ranger & Tonto several times and can tell you how bad it is, just from its awful acting and pacing. As a movie fan, I could understand if I didn't feel the need to make up my own mind.|0
I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly liked. I found it interesting that there are a lot of great horror films and documentaries that follow the exploits of killers in the early 1900s and early 1960s. In fact, some of them look really good, and even if it weren't for its bad acting, people might think it's pretty funny. That makes it hard to see why it wasn't more popular. This movie (originally entitled 'The Wild Thing') is just awful.|0
"North and South is a miniseries from the ""golden age"" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances--especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story."|1
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person 's past ? this one doesn't have anything to do with that either, he seems to assume that someone is talking about their past. I'm not going to lie, I had my doubts. I didn't get it from anyone but the director of this film. So even though I can understand why you'd think this would be a good movie, I've been thinking of all the movies in this series so far.|0
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film 's main achievements . When you hear a vague outline of the story then you are not allowed to see it, unless you wish. In the end all that matters is that the protagonist has something to say about his past.The only reason I can think of why people won't go through with this film was because they don't like the movie and want to know who played whom. This film does an incredible job. I didn't even notice anyone making eye contact or commenting on the dialogue.|0
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford 's best in my opinion . No major stars ,no big deal ,you could do better in this movie. I am a longtime critic of the film industry and I think there is no such thing as good filmmaking. The director (Michael Ruse) is a total idiot who doesn't know how to use his considerable talents to deliver an outstanding movie. I really don't like this movie and it's terrible. But that was only because Michael Ruse gave away all his ideas and talent at the expense of some very talented, creative, independent actors.|0
Having just got the `` Loony Tunes Golden Collection '' ( which i HIGHLY recommend , by the way ) and it was great. The movie is well written, but if you want a good adventure movie, this is NOT your movie.I would not recommend it as an adult movie because of the acting and story.The only thing I noticed at this movie was that I had to watch the opening 2 minutes. Then the opening 3 minutes of the sequel. It takes away from the original feeling that the movie should be better. I think I have come to the wrong place here.|0
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!This short will bring lots of laughs.|1
"This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger , and I don't even remember why that happened. If you want to know what's really happening right now, here are some of those things that happened since the beginning of this post. THE MOTHER OF THE DEAD:
I found this movie after watching another movie called ""Dawn of the Dead"". There were several good moments along with some very bad scenes. This movie is so bad that they can no longer be trusted.The only other decent thing about this movie is that it doesn't even follow the plot."|0
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations , discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional distress. ""The only reason we went to this festival was because of my love of horror movies. There was something really creepy about the sight of blood spatter on the floor and the smell of gasoline coming from the incinerators... It was kind of scary when I got home but it never crossed my mind that there was something so horrific in the air outside."" If you've never been to a festival, this one could be your first time around."|0
Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all.|1
The best of everything . Just what is the best of everything ? It is different for everyone but for one person. And because I can't believe it's possible, why would I even try it? I've seen this movie before. You know how I found out that a movie was actually worth watching (even if you're not good at it)? In this movie I watched as several friends with whom I had previously met. They got married and moved to Las Vegas when their son arrived on the planet. A few years later they moved back to Australia.|0
For my money , probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford could have produced. The cast is terrific and has great chemistry to it. There's no real mystery, but there's a lot of plot twists that don't fit any of the main characters (particularly those in the show) who really don't have much to offer. It was very hard to believe I'd seen this movie. I didn't think it was an easy movie for a TV show star to watch on a regular basis as well.|0
One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as thriller and drama. This was the genre that made up most of the early TV shows in the country. It wasn't until 1977 that it was revealed that there were no live action versions of Crime movies or TV specials. It was also true that, even with many original series, most of the major stars (or at least actors) didn't make it to the final three seasons of the show.|0
I haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and I have been searching for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the ending eludes me. It was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run.|1
A remarkable film , bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much , much more than that. The cast is extremely well choreographed, and the script is easy to understand. I really like this movie! I am not sure if I would recommend this movie to someone who wants to get a taste of suspense in their life. And I cannot say enough good things about this sequel. It's very dark and disturbing at first, but it ends with some great performances from many characters.|0
Based on Mika Waltari's Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.The Plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording,But all in all it has a strong social content:Man is ruled by his emotions,and that every action has an equal consequence.But to truly enjoy this film,First see the movie,then read the book.Although different,it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen,and gives breath to some more of the depth of Sinuhe.|1
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock.|1
"I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest has recently been rekindled by visiting Hilton Head - the next island over from ""Yamacraw"" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent ""The Water is Wide"". With the benefit of knowledge I have reappraised Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. Three things still strike me about this tale: 1."|1
"I finally received my DVD today, viewed it and I'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of ""Rich and Famous"" that the edited for TV version of the film that somehow made it onto VHS sometime in the late 90's but, now WB has corrected the error and released it on DVD complete with the airplane restroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the Hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C**t!"|1
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely.I like The Gilmore Girls but I am not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson).|1
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War . My aunt actually played in this movie as well, but only because it was so much better. This movie was awful. I just sat there thinking how badly this film would be made for a TV show. And then after reading this and seeing this, I thought that this movie should be good. Not bad, not terrible.It's probably worth spending a little more time with this movie if you haven't been watching it, but don't worry. The plot is what makes this kind of thing such a disappointment.|0
Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his RN ex-fiancée. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk.|1
Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama.|1
this is a really great series . i love the show and i am so glad it is n't canceled because of it. this is one of those movies that doesn't have any reason to exist even if it existed at all. I thought it could have been done better but instead it's just a total waste of time...it sucks as hell. maybe they should have made another one of those shows with different plot lines. I don't know why people would like to watch this movie. I think some people are trying to make the movie into a horror movie.|0
"Pat Conroy 's autobiographical book `` The Water Is Wide '' proves to be something of a Southern `` Upstate hottie'' and his love affair with the black community has come to define him. There are some good parts to this movie, but most of the other parts are simply awful. Even the soundtrack is just awful. The opening credits seem to say something like ""you'll never walk down the street without hearing this song,'' but in reality it really does nothing to make you feel nostalgic for the 1970s. The movie begins as one of the most boring TV shows I have watched in a long time."|0
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations, including the Edgar Reitz office.|1
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through . It has a great ensemble of characters , and as you watch the first half of the film you'll realize how little they were doing. So when I finally realized that I had to see it for myself (it's a really hard movie to make out), I went looking for more. Then, when I looked at the script, I decided it was probably one of my favorites.The main bad part about this film is that I don't like the fact that it was set in an era where men are not allowed to have wives anymore.|0
"The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful . I liked the movie . Can anyone give me a rating ? I was looking for a really interesting comedy with a decent premise. Unfortunately, this movie did not make it onto my screen at all. After seeing these movies online, I quickly discovered that there were too many funny movies on the Internet that I could not enjoy. Fortunately, I went to the theater and decided to see this movie because it was hard to believe that someone would want to spend $50,000 watching an hour-long ""junk"" movie."|0
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration ( and music ) . I don't think there was ever a better way to tell a story with an actor. This film has a rather simple plot. There are five main protagonists: a high-ranking official in the U.S. government who has been accused by a secret agency of having some kind of nefarious motive. In order to find the culprit, the US military is given a helicopter to carry three soldiers who are assigned to retrieve a stolen cargo from the ship.|0
1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in the wild. A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers.|1
"for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s , its shocking how not a single person has watched it. It takes place in another world and is based almost entirely on the real life adventures of a young couple. My name is Kevin, but I've always wanted to write ""A Little Story"". So I'm gonna start with what I wrote about A Little Story . In the early days of the film there was a group of people who were trying to break into Hollywood and steal a few movies from theaters."|0
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings . In Europe, in the United States, in Japan, even in Asia , it shows people's feelings. It is all about the fear of their lives and the possibility of death. This movie does not have any of that. The problem is that there is no compassion. The film goes to lengths to make you feel like a traitor. There is no mercy or love for one's family or friends. When we first watch the movie I thought it was going to be an easy movie.|0
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld,after ELR and after Friends. Those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.KOQs came at the end of this special time in TV. But don't let that dissuade you.King of Queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.Seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so hard than I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs comes real close.When it comes to laughing, I have to rate KOQs second only to Seinfeld.|1
"I ca n't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten . To be honest , I saw this flick and am very glad that I didn't watch it, because it's so good.It was pretty much my favorite film by far in this sequel. It takes place a couple of months before the world starts to really come to itself, and one of the main characters tries to start his life on earth by taking an M. Night Shyamalan (Kung-fu hero) as his friend at school. There is nothing wrong with ""M. Night Shyamalan"" when you think about it."|0
One of the best! As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.|1
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld, so we get two hours of comedy, a lot of acting and lots of laughs. It's like a soap opera, but instead of doing a lot of talking (like in the Simpsons episode) the characters take on their own lives. The story gets really boring, there are no plot points, nothing really interesting to be talked about at all. All I know about Seinfeld is that it was good.|0
I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field.|1
I just started watching The Show around July . I found it by mistake , I was channel surfing during that time and thought I would like to see a different style of comedy. I've been through so much this show over the last several years and it made me angry, even more so at myself as I tried to make up for lost time. I'm usually not too excited to go out on dates with my friends (i.e. they're always trying to find their favorite movie/tour group). It's funny because I had no interest in going out with such close friends.|0
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a ""family saga"" rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion."|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about. Or, maybe it isn't: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke. It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. He gets into the form of the world around him entirely, without a story, bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, as his camera (shooting on supposedly discarded film stock) wanders like in a pure travelogue.|1
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's ""Land of the Lost"") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. ; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair."|1
(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home.|1
"In `` Black Snake Moan , '' writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me has to wonder if this might be a sign of something bad. In the movie in particular, he does some things that are even worse:
He tells the story of a man who went to America and lost his life after being hit by a helicopter. He takes a chance on an old woman whom he believes may be one of his friends' best friends. Unfortunately, as the film becomes more and more confusing, he comes across as unhelpful and ultimately tries to get back what he can."|0
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job. The movie's point is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view.The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age. The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over. Although the text of `The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.|1
"I viewed The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' tight script was just what this evening of ""shorts"" needed. It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. The Reader was simple story telling in it's best form, well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted."|1
One of the many backwoods horror 's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the few movies that has it all. The story is just as much fun as a movie made up of cheap action, low budget acting etc. The character development is good but the story is so bad (and I can't remember why) that I feel cheated. After years of watching horror films I began wondering if this was because I was too busy to take care of them or because my interest in the business had been piqued!|0
I couldn't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips.|1
Fantastic documentary . A movie within a movie . I 'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother 's death that it has been shown here and there...This film does NOT make any sort of sense, but it IS the same story.The only two things that matter here are the plot and execution, and if he had just kept his job, this wouldn't have occurred at all.I'm sure many people in the world will think this was some sort of fake news conspiracy theory, but what really bothers me is how easy it is for someone to make these sorts of ludicrous claims.|0
i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it.|1
First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70's when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home.|1
"I don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, ""that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS"". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. I must tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision."|1
GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen.. He acts it up, perfectly. This was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is.. It almost made me cry watching him.I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend to John Belushi as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. Very sad, what both of them went through.I really felt for both Val and Robin during his rough times.|1
One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wish it had told us more. I have read many biographies and seen other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control.|1
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have ever seen. In my opinion, Merv Griffin's movie (and the film that preceded it) was not for the least bit successful at making a $100 million dollar box office hit. It is hard to pick a film that has gotten as much positive attention from critics, especially in the wake of its highly praised debut in 2000, and still be rated as one of the best movies of the millennium.|0
I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say `` french culture '' . The main character, who doesn't have a very big name, goes into battle with a young boy named Oren, but is beaten by the other members. I was looking forward to this movie when I first saw it. I always felt like it had a lot going for it from the opening scene and the fact that you have to kill two evil guys in order to make it worth watching. Unfortunately, I didn't get around to watching the film after reading all the complaints about the cast.|0
I get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. I have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and I am surprised at just how much I am enjoying it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait.|1
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this.|1
"Michelle, Anicée Alvina, was so nice, and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The ""seasons reprise"" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... Please, if you know where i could find a VHS of the film, mail me!! My husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out."|1
There are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently.|1
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ""slasher"" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great ""rare"" film from Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films ""Squirm"" and ""Blue Sunshine"".Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."|1
SPOILERS AHEAD -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Mel has got it going. He knows what he's doing, so much so that he can be able to see exactly what she's doing (and is acting in the film). After all of that, where do you go from here? The only thing anyone ever thought they knew about her was that when she went out on a date or something, she'd never show up at your door. Well, this is one of the more ridiculous movies I've seen in my long career.|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission, I can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year) but once I'd started I had to watch to the end.The down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. All the way through, I wished I was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice.|1
Do n't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you ? This movie has been in my head all year. I have said before that I don't find much of a story to it, but this movie is very well executed and the plot is quite interesting with so many characters being created. For some reason I think these are the worst parts of the film. You can almost hear how annoyed everyone is for not getting along with each other! The acting was so bad that I forgot to take a picture of them.|0
Robin Hood ; Men in Tights is worth watching , I recently watched it because I 've just become a fan of this series.It's one of the best TV comedies you've never seen on TV . The acting is good, with plenty of fun and some really interesting character designs.The characters are amazing and they're all very likable as well. First off, let me give you a few pointers that I have to give here. I'm sorry for not being able to give you the spoilers, but I am absolutely certain you don't have the right to read this review.|0
"`` Stripperella '' is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones ( voiced by Pamela Anderson ) who tries and fails to get in trouble for being a child-molester during her high school year. When she finally manages to cross the border from Mexico, they are left stranded at the bottom of the world with no other options. I don't think audiences are going to enjoy the film. The characters aren't clever, the plot is plain stupid, and the acting is pathetic. And this is a good movie! If you're into ""horror films"", you might not care much."|0
"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* -""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital."|1
I love this film ( dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish , and i don't know who to comment on because i have heard about this before. but i am sure most of the viewers are too scared to see anything else and want to watch it....it's like being stuck inside a horror movie! I can't even think of anyone with a better idea of what would happen to them. I mean seriously, you can go into an asylum and you're probably going to get caught in some kind of trap.|0
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.Despite incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners.Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him.|1
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish movie on cinema! Therefor, I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of thrill and humour is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea.|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway).The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work.|1
It 's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it 's either a must-haves or has to have.I think this movie is one of the better comedies I've seen in ages, but I can't stand seeing people who know what they're doing. This isn't just a slapstick comedy for adults, it was so poorly acted that some of us even found it amusing (even though you don't know how many other kids were laughing at the idea of this flick).The acting is horrendous.|0
"spoiler--In 1993, African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with ""Posse"". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the main character, Jessie Lee.Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba."|1
"i love this movie . is it on air anymore ? what can i do to get it on air
I had not thought about it. This was the worst movie i have seen so far. I just bought a copy in my box office and it wasnt even worth the price. The writing was really bad and its very boring, especially considering it has only 5 parts. There was also some stupid dialogue which is hard to understand. This film is great! I am an adult man and all I want is to be entertained with fantasy adventure films that will entertain the whole family at least once per month."|0
"I have been a ""huge"" rush fan ever since ""moving pictures"" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why Rush is so popular. They completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. A real example of this is during ""yyz"" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. They really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful ""lust"" that rarely happens anymore."|1
15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata. However as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue'.|1
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""Adam's Rib"" ""Holiday"" Psycho melodramas ""Gaslight"" ""A Double Life"" a great semi western ""Heller in Pink Tights"" not to mention ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Travels with my Aunt"" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera."|1
-it has Carla Gugino * yay * and a crappy ending * boo * - '' Jaded '' is a good example of how bad TV is made out of. It really doesn't deserve it's own category.This show deserves some serious consideration! I can't imagine the producers or the writers were trying to create any kind of comedy in this series. What could be worse than that? There's something for everyone involved, even if they don't fully understand the plot. For example, the whole story revolves around an African-American man whose mother is a black woman who is murdered by her black boyfriend.|0
` 5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters , the story of one of Australia's most hunted marine creatures. I just saw this flick and thought it was pretty good. The plot is a bit too slow to keep up with something like this I can't believe I've seen so many such films. There's no need to think too hard about whether we're at the beginning or ending of something, even if it ends up working as a joke.There is absolutely nothing bad about it.|0
"Forget about Donnie Darko . I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I read come straight out of Hollywood, and I was wondering if you could provide a little context to give us an idea what kind of movie is actually being made in the United States. I think you would probably find it interesting that when you watch ""The Great Escape,"" you might not even know how many hours were spent filming it. If you watched it at all, then you probably don't miss out on the plot."|0
I ca n't comment on the accuracy of this production , historical or literary , but I can say that it's a well-produced film. The script is decent in many respects, especially if you like an interesting story . And yes, there's something about the dialogue that seems to confuse the viewer even more than the fact that they really are not aware that what they are saying is actually true. This was a relatively good film from beginning to end, and at its worst comes across as too scripted and dull.|0
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time . We loved it so much . It was funny, and interesting. I didn't see the whole film until I saw it after watching it, which I thought was a good idea .I am also going to rewatch this film now because it makes me feel better. This is my first time reading an American author's book (especially a classic). There are no classics in the United States that have ever appeared in print (though many novels do have titles).|0
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot , while still maintaining the elements that make it entertaining. I've seen this movie more than once over the past couple of days, almost from the start. The plot is simple: in the beginning, a group of people have kidnapped a woman and taken her home. One of them wants to kill everyone involved (including their parents). However, there is no real dialogue between them. Lewis Seiler is an American actor born in Los Angeles, Arizona.|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film . The backwoods slasher pretty much started off well, but when the story got a little stale in the first five minutes or so, I gave up and decided to do this movie again. It seems like it must've been one of those times in my life that I found myself in an awkward situation at the beginning of a scene where I was supposed to kill someone on purpose (I don't really know what happened next) and then proceeded to kill myself.|0
"""Jaded"" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like ""Indecent Behavior"" or ""Friend Of The Family"". ""Jaded"" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. The raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie."|1
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments , Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air . The film has no real drama, so I'm sure it will be entertaining as well. I was not very impressed by this movie, but in all honesty, it is quite funny. The director did not really have to work closely with the cast members of this movie - even his co-workers seemed to have more respect for each other than his wife. It seems like every time there is a scene between two people who have similar looks, we find out something strange is going on at the table.|0
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it.|1
The first time I saw `` Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy '' , was in the early 90s. The show is set in the same story line (the plot of which consists mostly of two characters, Alice and Bob) as the original novel that inspired the original movie. Although they seem to share much in common, they don't look alike at all. We are told about a young girl named Alice who has suffered a severe brain injury--a traumatic brain disease--and decides to find her new family on the farm near the edge of town.|0
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning , and have felt it is overlooked at the award show. I've had a few years to get into it so I couldn't judge the merits of this one either, but after reading about it I knew it was decent enough to watch. If only I had known how great this movie could possibly be that I didn't go looking for more.The story begins very well with the arrival of the Queen. She is taken by an old friend to New Orleans where she comes across the queen's family.|0
"After getting hooked on the mini series, ""North & South,"" I could hardly wait for the continuation, ""North & South II."" Then years later, along came Book III, ""HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III."" FINALLY, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so enraptured by this series that I taped each part off of TV and then managed to get family and friends hooked and I watched it AGAIN, each time someone new wanted to see them."|1
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class . The musicianship of this band is outstanding. I wish they had a better recording studio, because if they wanted to perform live they would make it a big success in that department. This was probably the best concert tour I've ever been to. I just received this ticket last week (April 2nd). As expected, it is not good! There isn't even a small amount of variety on any given night, but the music has no purpose whatsoever whatsoever.|0
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield . The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor who has just had a birthday party for a friend of his. He sets up an experiment to see if people can imitate his creation, but the results are quite disappointing. The story goes on and on and on about how he can only imagine what it would be like to live in this universe and is left wanting more. This film should be hard to recommend to anyone interested in science fiction or fantasy (especially those looking to watch Star Wars movies).|0
"One of the best ! As being a fan of the civil war , I was very pleased with the ending . A good show, but it wasn't so well acted as to be suitable for adults. And I thought the actors looked great on the screen. The other three cast members were also quite good at their jobs.I had trouble believing that they were going to be able to go back in time or even return to an earlier time. My first time seeing ""Lethal Weapon"" is by far my favorite series ever."|0
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably American accent.|1
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta , where we can see some amazing films. I did not expect this film to have been made into a DVD release (I mean, if the DVD was made from the original material). However, it is an interesting project that could have had a great sequel or even a sequel to come out next year, especially since it has no plot, just a pretty short story about a guy who kills his girlfriend to get revenge against the world.|0
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking . I 'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and see something special. The story is just plain boring and repetitive, and the dialogue is just plain annoying. The script is nothing special. Nothing like the plot you've ever seen or experienced before. It has been made by a man with a reputation for giving his employees such an unsatisfactory job. This is not a great film; this one is mediocre. One of the better films I have seen yet. Not bad at all, even better than the others.|0
Just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded.|1
Brilliant film! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats how it is with post pulp era. Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity!Anyway the film's about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it.|1
One of the better made for TV biopics , I just wish it had told us more . I have a feeling that it will continue to be a huge hit on the internet this year.If anyone else has a question - I'd love to get my answer, but if not, let me know here . I was intrigued by this series as an adult film when I heard about it with a friend and she liked it so much she wanted to watch one. Her husband didn't mind seeing it because he was a bit older than she and he thought it sounded like a good idea.|0
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. Eg. When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun.|1
I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes . I have only watched it once in my life. The plot is simple enough to remember and I'm very happy to say that it didn't take long at all to realize that it would serve as the story arc for many of the series' characters. This was one of the best TLC shows I have ever seen. I loved this show. It's just so good that there wasn't any sense of pacing or character development anywhere in it.|0
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'The Gunfighter' by Henry King, and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. 'The Gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.However, I personally find 'Wagon Master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. Although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring.|1
"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying . In their escape , the bandits kill the man in front of them, and take out the passenger who tried to get his money back . The most memorable film ever made about the ""trouble"" was The Dark Side Of The Moon starring George Clooney. It is said that there are only two things on this earth that people love more than watching TV or reading a book (although I'd like to believe that you can't do all that much for free! )."|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore.|1
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom , which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of many viewers.The movie, directed by Matt Reeves (Dwayne Johnson) takes place in 1980 and includes several characters who appear for various reasons. The films are all about relationships. My friend, my brother, and my family have lived in the neighborhood for many years, and most people know what is happening to us now. We used to be on the block, but we didn't think anything of it until the first episode.|0
"Tex Avery 's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the most famous of these, even though his films may be dated to that era. In spite of the fact that he wasn't an ""anti-Semitic"" or anything, he did have some good jokes on the subject of racism. In 1943, when he was working on a story about the French invasion, he noticed something odd: The Germans were moving into a village in Eastern Europe that was totally unoccupied by the Allied forces."|0
In the midst of a documentary about his parents , the filmmaker 's mother dies , but he continues making documentaries in her name until he is forced to give up his film rights for good. The film makes a very poor effort to make friends with women, which is one reason its not quite as entertaining as it looks.If you can't take this seriously , I would recommend giving it an A+ grade. This film's main problem is its subtext. There isn't a single mention of sexual relationships or any other sort of relationship going on between the actors and director.|0
Police officer Dirk Hendricks ( Jamie Bartlett ) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ) .A member of a notorious gang, he tries to bring about the downfall of his sister, but after her death he fails because she was not properly punished.The story is set in 1960s San Francisco at a time when the US was waging a brutal war on the African race. Nowadays we are all living in cities that were once safe havens for criminals and gangs.There are many other aspects to this film which you may want to get into before watching.|0
This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is wicked great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is terrific as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch.|1
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona.|1
In Crystal City , a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis ( Ben Johnson ) and Sandy ( David Bautista ) to help sell some goods they have in the desert for $1 each. However, they are caught in a long drawn out car crash that leaves them stranded at a nearby gas station. The book is a satire on the Mormon religion, and all the stories about the Mormon missionaries in Utah are just one of many lies told by their handlers. Their mission is to rescue those who have fallen under its protection.|0
`5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like cobber' and generally being the classic underdog.Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics' such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People.In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.Set in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town.|1
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points in te cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Messiah on video in one take. One point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.|1
I have been a `` huge '' rush fan ever since `` moving pictures '' and this concert is simply not worth that cost. The performances here are too slow to get in my mind. Some people who were at the show did not really want to enter, but you can't really tell anyone what went on behind the scenes because they're all dressed in bright red uniforms and no makeup - which is great! I wish there had been a chance to see an actress like Amy Winehouse or Jennifer Aniston when this took place in front of so many audiences.|0
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin 's short 'Chess Fever ' , a mad tale set in Soviet Union-era Manhattan. I'm not sure where to start, but it's good to be back at it again when I'm going to see it again (it's one helluva movie). I've seen movies like this before, and I'm very familiar with how they're supposed to feel - even though I haven't seen the actual film. However, what makes this film so special is that many of the major characters appear to be completely different versions of their original selves.|0
"Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction . This is what today 's documentaries are all about . It was very well thought out and well executed, even if it took a little longer than a few seconds to build on. If you want to hear the story behind these films in a good way you should go for it . I don't see how they could have done better
This film has no real purpose beyond to make people smile and laugh. It's like watching a comedy show that never really makes any sense but just keeps getting better."|0
This if the first movie I 've given a 10 to in years . If there was ever a movie that did not come out as a top 10 or top 10 on this list, it was this one . Just how much better you would feel when watching an animated film! It takes less than 20 seconds to watch and then you are done. The animation itself is decent at best but the characters look like puppets instead of humans. The acting is also terrible.The plot is rather pointless. There has been some very stupid stuff in the series.|0
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out!|1
With all the dreck out there , this is a gentle movie about young love . Yes , it 's hard to tell if this is serious or emotional, but one of those films that should have seen a sequel in the past.It's hard to see why anyone thought this would make a good movie. Why does it sound like the kind of music we want our children playing? The only reason I didn't watch this film was that I couldn't believe it when I tried to convince myself I was watching this. There is not much more you can do than to be a loser.|0
"This film blew me away . I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot . After watching it for some minutes, I realized that no one in there had actually been convicted of any crimes. And then what happened was this:
A bunch of people who were convicted of murder and arson were sent to jail on the condition that their bodies were not burned alive by the killer. An interesting thing happened to me while viewing the film, and it came back to haunt me. If you enjoy my other reviews please consider sharing them with your friends, family or even yourself!"|0
Although dated , this film is definitely worth a watch . I saw it about eight times as a teenager and there are some scenes where I feel like I forgot to tell you who they were. I thought it was great but the characters weren't memorable so I didn't really get much of anything out of it. These films don't seem to be very good looking, even in their early '60's form. There is nothing interesting about them. They start off with a pretty young actress that gets more than she bargained for (the only one who doesn't have any hair on her face).|0
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and , as mysteries should , you will appreciate that. I'm really glad to see some of these, especially if they are going to take a more dramatic turn.I guess it doesn't hurt to see how the story unfolds, but I still can't help thinking it could have gone a bit more different. In this particular case, however, things did just go haywire.The most annoying aspect of this episode is that there were so many people at all points on the scene.|0
"""Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!"" ""Can you play dead?"" It's difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime dramedy. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's perfectly awful one-liners. Cracking out such gems as ""Adios, Blimp,"" Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch."|1
The show is GREAT. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they were not *that*bad*, but because the show is really *that*good*.The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. It's OK to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average...|1
This show is really great . It 's smart.It 's funny.It 's great acting and writing . This show is about a woman trying to prove her innocence. She discovers some of the things she learned from her childhood. She goes to see her uncle in the hospital where he is going through a mental health issue. He doesn't seem to have any sense of his own or his family's well-being.The ending is disappointing. I enjoyed watching this movie because I thought it wouldn't be much different from what we saw at the cinema. There is something wrong with the script.|0
Police officer Dirk Hendricks (Jamie Bartlett) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).A member of the South African Parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist.South African born attorney Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent Mpondo.As well as Steve Sizela, Mpondo's friend who was arrested along with him, and never heard from again.This film is one of the best films to come out about the South African regime of Aparthied, in the past.Everybody should watch it.|1
"Very good `` Precoder '' starring Dick Barthelmess , which in a way , kind of reminded me of Hawks and Spiders . I thought I was out of order when my husband said he wanted to see this movie, but it turned out he didn't really care. When I saw this movie from Paramount they took some liberties from the first one and tried to make it look better with a lot of editing changes. What's wrong? I can't believe this movie is called an ""exploitative"" action comedy because it doesn't even have a plot!"|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched.|1
"I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release . It is a delightfully cute, well written script that does everything you could imagine it to do ;-). After this movie has been played several times, I am going to go off on a tangent, since this is my 10th review , but I just couldn't resist going back and reviewing these two films. The first one was simply nothing like what I've heard from the original.The second one didn't even have ""real"" characters. What makes this movie so memorable?"|0
"This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However the same cannot be told of the gals. In the end too, u see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was ""There was no Taylor"". And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of Ben. Also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben."|1
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ``I'm not going back.' This has no relevance. I don't think anyone should be offended by this film's title, because this was nothing special. The characters are interesting but not the plot."" There's a good chance that the film will get worse as time progresses. For the past few years I've seen horror films in Europe, and there aren't many of them in the United States."|0
This small John Ford western with no 'stars ' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. There's only one reason this film is still considered an American movie at all. The fact is it wasn't made on the same budget as BAM! by any standards. It was so awful that I think you would have heard something about it somewhere else in America if it didn't exist to this day. We don't really understand why we did it because our lives had become so fucked up.|0
1981 's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there . It 's one of the most beautiful films I've watched and I have seen in quite a while. The characters are beautifully drawn and the setting is simply fantastic. There were so many other movies made over the decades that I never felt comfortable watching them all but here we go again with this sequel! I love this book. When you read it, you'll be amazed how complete it is. It is an excellent piece of film history.|0
"I 'm not the type of person to watch T.V . shows because the acting normally sucks or it 's boring and I've never seen a show with that much depth, but I was just so lucky to sit through it at home watching it all."" Wake up one night and think about why this episode is so awful. You don't even get to say something negative about someone else in an episode. Why can't they tell us what they're really thinking and feeling right now? And WHY THE HELL NOT?? ?"|0
"Wow ! An amazing , lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one . This was the last thing I remembered about it because it didn't make me want to watch anything else. All of the other reviewers thought it was too old and ""too dated"". They were just plain wrong.I was looking forward to seeing this movie. When I got home from work I looked on TV and watched an hour and a half of all three movies which are not in chronological order. Then I came up with the following suggestions: (1), (2), and (3)."|0
Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought it as part of my wishlist! My first time watching Akhenaton at the local cinema I was extremely disappointed. For that matter, I didn't understand what he was doing on screen or what he meant to the audience. In fact, I wasn't able to get an impression by going through his face. And now, thanks to a friend who knows more about Akhenaton (he does not speak fluent German), I have to admit that I had no idea what was happening.|0
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am . My brother and I were channel surfing for about 15 minutes. We laughed a few times but we couldn't see anything on screen. The story is a little too short (not funny enough for the most part, but it was worth the wait) and the film doesn't really stand out. The acting is all over the place and that's not to say there isn't some level of tension.The sound design is a little bland with just one or two characters who are both voiced.|0
"So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris . We 're all here on an exchange of tapes, and the director is a man who would have been great to watch if he hadn't ruined every single line by making it so difficult that you couldn't decipher what he did. My favourite movie ever made was Mr. Bambi's ""Piano Man"", directed by Michael J. Fox. The idea behind it was simple: people want something different from music they can find anywhere. There's no shortage of interesting films that make up for these limitations."|0
I must say it was a let down. Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, I am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.But the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of English. Its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in India which talks in English even at home, but I am sure its not as formal as in the movie. Moreover, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in English.|1
In a time of bad , if not plain awful , comedies , King of Queens is more than just a fun piece of crap to watch. It has a lot going on in it, but the movie doesn't do itself any good. The characters aren't especially interesting either, so why bother trying to explain what's going on??? There are too many jokes. Most of the comedy is about two different people who seem to know each other at all times, and it isn't even supposed to be funny . I can understand that they don't get along well.|0
I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end.|1
Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well.|1
This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes.|1
Absolutely , I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting , fascinating and certainly beautiful film. Unfortunately the plot was predictable, the acting wasn't even that good and the camera was distracting from the movie at times, which could be attributed to the lack of time spent shooting each scene (I'm not sure if it was actually necessary because they were working on a script). I really like this movie but unfortunately there are so many scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with reality. It's also very cheap - you'll only find one or two extras for about half the price.|0
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.Many films from the Golden Age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. They date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. Who nowadays asks for a highball? Or wears a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. Frankly, much of value is missing from those days.In any case, go with it and enjoy.|1
"I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie ""Mighty Joe Young."" What attracted me to ""Wagon Master"" were the great songs sung by the ""Sons of the Pioneers."" Merian C. Cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong."|1
The above summary really is n't meant as a slam against this film , as the series followed a very typical plotline, but also had a good feel for it. The characters are well handled, they're nice and the script makes them more believable than most movies have. If I didn't think of it, I don't think I'd want to watch this film! There has been a lot of criticism lately about the movie's premise. Some people say it is too simplistic. There is certainly nothing in it that feels realistic or original.|0
"This show is my guilty pleasure all the way ! ! When I first tuned in to America 's Next Top Model, I was surprised at just how well it performed and if I had a copy of ""The Great Escape"" I would buy it back ! So I'm not going to spoil the fun for you guys.But don't read too much into everything here as there seems to be some plot twist out there. In fact, this show is pretty damn dull! Not only that, we hear so little about the real events leading up to their demise, they never actually see any action."|0
I'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film. If you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. Warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed.|1
"Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie . Is hilarious and funny yet has the right mix of humor and violence. Does it get to be a serious comedy ?I would love for this movie to be called ""Dirty Shame"".This movie looks great on the screen but I cannot find out why it is bad.I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time and this is one of the finest films I have watched.The film takes place in an industrial city that seems like a pretty nice neighborhood."|0
"Michelle , Anicée Alvina , was so nice , and I really fall in love with her . She died a very sad, sad day at the hands of a murderer. The people she loved most had their lives cut out for them, just by the time she got to college. Wow, this book is such an absolute gem ! Even though it has nothing to do with the real subject matter, and doesn't offer any advice on ""how to become a mother or daughter of a psychopath"", the author says that he wants to make the reader feel empathy towards someone who has done anything wrong."|0
I wanted to watch this , to get a inside look at the show . It told the story more vividly than I was willing to spend a decade of my life writing, so it was a little over half of what I had planned to. I just couldn't sit through all those episodes. I could feel myself trying to think of any excuse to watch it. If there were only one way to make it worth watching, it would be for me to write it down here and go back and watch every other episode once I finished it.|0
I love this film (dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name! ), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries, and of the city itself. I really want to see the followup 'Les Poupees Russes ' (the Russian Dolls), I'm guessing it wont be released here?|1
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if I have to read a lot. I can't seem to find a film with so many people that fits my budget, it seems like it was only a matter of time until I saw this film. It's one of those scenes in which I simply cannot get enough of it. If you're a big fan of the show (I haven't), don't think much about what it will do to your life... but it does have some good moments...|0
I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic!|1
"Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little bit better. Not only did he have nothing in common, he even managed to get married with two of the women. He also took the blame for everything wrong done by the ""bad actors"", as if they weren't part of the problem. I was not expecting an award for this film but what more can I ask for from one of the finest acting performances ever made? This is my favorite cast performance of all time."|0
"Very good ""Precoder"" starring Dick Barthelmess, which in a way, kind of reminded me of Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterful William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture ""Wings"".Barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues."|1
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows the pace considerably. Billie ""Buckwheat"" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left behind on the riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment."|1
If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.|1
"I 'll be brief : I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this that makes it even worse. For example: the scene where Dr. Zukunov tells his girlfriend that they are ""all dead bodies"" before going to the hospital. He goes on to explain in more detail exactly why he should have made this scene. It wasn't a particularly memorable scene as I thought it was too low and had to cut out some lines. This film is really disappointing at best. As I mentioned, it takes place several days after World War Two."|0
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially Daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. I really did love the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love it that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too.|1
I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with `` Valley of the Kings . '' These movies have been around for a good part of their existence; it's easy to see how they've become a trend, and if you listen to these movies, you'll see that there are plenty of bad moments in them. But at some point, I started to get bored. Well, after a while, when I tried to watch something like this on DVD, I had to wait several days before I could actually find a movie.|0
Believe it or not , the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once , and was missing for nearly two years. When I saw that she didn't work anymore, I immediately bought a copy of The New Girl . In it I read that she lived in a big apartment complex in Los Angeles (where her mother lived) which seemed to make her too busy with the monastic life to get out of bed. So when I first heard about this novel, I immediately went online looking for some information on it. But what I found wasn't quite so clear.|0
"then you will be a big fan of this movie . Its almost the same basic concept , a nice, well paced film that doesn't really offer much else in the way of plot or any interesting character development. A lot depends on how it all plays out in the theater. I didn't expect anything more than a bunch of ""bad guys go to war and everyone goes home happy"". That's just what it was for me. What do you want people to get when they see The Hobbit? How do they feel about it?"|0
I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, thought it was great. We got to see, Robin always being 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), was enlightening.|1
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film . It was when I was a teenager , and it took me by surprise to realize that this movie would never be released. I've seen a lot of movies where the director has a script, and we all assume that they're based on the plot. This is the only film that I really felt like taking the time to take a deep breath, and do my best to understand how it came together so that I could actually watch it. It's not too bad if you think about it, but some things will get lost in translation.|0
This movie was awesome , if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. I found this movie interesting to watch. It's like watching a short film in order to see what happens. At first glance it would seem to be a good thing because there are some great movies about aliens, but then one of them has a bad ending, the others have better moments. The cast doesn't seem like they're just bored, I guess they've never had much time for anything else.|0
"Robin Hood : Men in Tights ( 1993 ) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks . He has also made many memorable appearances on SNL's The Mindy Project (1971) and '60s Kids and Family Show (1973), most notably in the hilarious ""Climbing the Statue of Liberty"" (1983). He did not appear again for a few years, but he eventually returned after being cast in two films that were nominated for the Best Picture Award at the 1974 International Film Critics Association Awards. In 1967 he starred in an animated comedy titled ""Jaws"" with Tom Cruise and Bill Murray."|0
"This movie was so cool ! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends . I had just finished watching the original. It ended up getting better every film over the next four decades! I don't know if I can describe what a shock it was to find out that in this movie, you've got two women who are very ""different"". And then you start to get into their real personalities. They seem to care deeply enough about each other they don't bother even bothering to watch the third movie."|0
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound effect upon one's childhood as a child. There was nothing more than a story of what is happening to all of us as we grew into our twenties. It was so refreshing to watch an American kid grow up to be so successful that his father and mother left the country altogether, only to return home and join the same ""culture."" This film may have been good for the director, but it was bad. The script was terrible."|0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game . This is the number one best TH game in its class , and a shame it doesn't even come close to matching the gameplay of the previous game. What really annoyed me this time was not that there were no characters, just very generic dialogue. I thought they would try something different for the story, or at least try to have some kind of interesting twist. This game was fun to work with, especially when you don't have much of a story to add to your life.|0
"America 's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense . It has a great hostess , and the cast are good. The only problem is that none of the people were able to actually read this book.I can't say I agree completely with its premise but for the sake of argument it's not funny, it's not smart, and it doesn't have a ""proper"" story line.There are many things wrong with watching this movie. First off, there isn't any script whatsoever. Second, here's the worst part. The actors don't speak well."|0
A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. And when one of the young Mormon girls gets too close, it's all over in the house so the rest of the men have to deal with it! So now we have to see how this movie really plays. I suppose the only thing that can change is the plot or its execution.The film is very simple, but it could have just as easily been put together like this. The characters and the plot are not exactly the same, but they do share similarities.|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album.|1
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVD's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new. The film. The film is a re run of certain episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School and numerous others with a different edge. Introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move - especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque (something that is rarely done now).It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting up and training.|1
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . The movie uses the film's title to imply that blue people are so bad that they can't get jobs. In fact, if you wanted to call yourself an American, you'd be referred to as ``Blue'' in your local newspaper. It is not even clear from the script why a government agency would set up a special program to recruit and train those who do not follow the law to do their job.|0
"Pat Conroy's autobiographical book ""The Water Is Wide"" proves to be something of a Southern ""Up The Down Staircase"", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, ""Conrack"" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. The one actual actress in the bunch (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the ""tough nut"" Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze."|1
SPOILERS AHEAD------------------------- Mel has got it going on. From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie.|1
"I've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's proper rebirth on DVD. Of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if I had seen in it the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film ""Squirm"" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely Oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just to have them dispatched in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans."|1
I was expecting this movie to suck , but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film . Most of the scenes were just plain dull and lifeless.The acting is great as usual - it's like watching a movie on a television with no actors. It made me want to see more movies like this one. I'll never be disappointed if this film doesn't have better reviews in my life! I know it's a bit far-fetched to suggest that there isn't a lot of gore or nudity in this movie, but let's not get involved in it because we can't seem to understand each other.|0
"Having just watched this with my mother ( Who got it for Christmas ) i was thrilled to find something good, and I had no idea what to expect here. The story has an extremely interesting twist, as the characters are all in a cult-like ""cult."" A couple years ago, I read this book and found myself quite surprised at the length of the chapters. This is not a fantasy but a horror/horror fiction based on the works of Joseph Goebbels and his early films. If you like horror stories, this film might be right up your alley."|0
"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn't on so late at night. It's on at 12:30 AM. As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.I grew up in the 60's. I'm Hispanic and I had a ""White"" boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School."|1
I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. Granted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end.But what are they? Well, it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original, but it is better presented than other films of its kind.|1
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant repetition. At the end it's one of those movies that makes you laugh when something happens and ends up funny. The fact that it does make me laugh when something happens is beyond me. It gets even worse when the narrator has his head shaved a couple times in order to keep himself amused.This is another movie that seems to be made to entertain but can never find the laughs it should. What a pathetic attempt to glorify an old idea with all its own bizarre silliness!|0
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that . I got all the tapes , but they weren't well-made and the audio wasn't memorable. In any case, I couldn't stop watching this crap until it was cut for $1. This movie is really boring. I'm not sure if you know me by this title, but I'm a huge Dads fan, so I thought it would be nice to give a couple reviews on how this one went down in comparison to other movies out there. The acting is very poor, and there are no jokes.|0
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie. Is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.It shows a different face o Bogotá and I think that's very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world This is the first movie of the director Felipe Martinez and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.We need to continue support Colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.|1
Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor.|1
Graphics is far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to Underground. It deserves strong love. It is an insane game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even though graphics suck, thats doesn't make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES?|1
You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching the movie or not. If you do decide, it's more likely that you'll have to wait about 20 minutes. I think this movie is better for the audience but I just wish it hadn't been such a big hit. I saw this movie and was really sickened when I got home. It turned out quite a bit too much fun in my opinion. There are a few things that should be noted: The acting is horrible.|0
Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It seems to have already died. Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. I don't know why. It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I've seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne, and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland isn't up to those others. I was just fascinated with the filmmaking.|1
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own I would say it is not so bad. This movie is pretty good for its day-in-the-life style, and if there was one thing about the plot that should scare people off (or anyone who thinks they are supposed to be shocked when they find out the real story), it is this: ""I'm an American woman and I know what life is all about."" It can't help but have the feeling that many foreign-born Americans don't really even know the basics of the country they live in."|0
Honestly , when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana , I did not know how good it would be. In fact...it was a waste of all my time, effort and money . I had tried everything I could to find out exactly how good this movie would become, but with no luck.I'm glad they decided to wait two weeks for me to see it, but I wasn't going to disappoint you guys. All the dialogue was really annoying as well :PThe script is a total mess. The characters are just plain bad.|0
Whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. The story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. The storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie.|1
Hands down , the best drama/comedy show on television . A cleverly written show about a young mother and her husband who tries to turn her into an assassin. The only reason it doesn't work is that the characters are horrible, and the pacing is so lame they almost make the whole thing suck. There isn't too much of anything funny in this movie. I know you'd be interested in this kind of flick if it wasn't for the fact that I have watched quite a few episodes with my girlfriend and she has always loved it.|0
During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against a Yankee invasion.In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional feature-length films. With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG. Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success.|1
What can I say ? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an award that you can get yourself to like. However, you may be tempted by a few good scenes with one or more characters who look as if they could have played any role in this film.I found the plot of this movie too far ahead of its time which is very disappointing. There were so many interesting aspects about the life of George Osborne that I felt like it was almost out of place. The acting was also quite silly, especially when there were no subtitles.|0
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen ( mostly in English ) with no English subtitles. This is not a great piece of work from Aparna. He doesn't even speak English, nor does the actors do it at all. However, on the face of it, it makes sense to pay attention to Aparna's script because that is what he was known for. The acting is pretty poor, while the directing is quite good. I really find this one to be a disappointment. I'm extremely disappointed with ""Ascension""."|0
How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film ? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and one of the worst acting talent I have EVER seen. Makes me laugh but it is not so funny that it does not even make you laugh at all.There was a time when I believed in Hollywood films and I still find them quite boring...I am sorry to say that there has been an increase of people saying these things to me..but sadly, they seem to be losing their minds with every stupid comment.You know what I'm asking you? Go watch this movie!|0
"The best of everything. Just what is the best of everything? It is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. But alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes,""we are the captains of our own ships"", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. Once we make those choices then we must live with them."|1
This is a really great film ! It gets you thinking about your parents . How we all have fragile relationships with children, and what kind of good things happen to them that are hard for them to handle ? Well this movie has nothing to offer us. It is very boring in the least possible way but it has enough plot to justify the title and I'm not sure why it's so bad at all !I didn't even expect this movie to turn out so poorly. However after watching this crap I couldn't help but feel like a spoiled brat on my way to having sex with her daughter.|0
"I finally received my DVD today , viewed it and I 'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical release of The Dark Knight . It is an absolute must have!This film is not only beautiful but also very interesting for many people who love their films. You cannot tell that I don't know if it was meant to be taken as a movie in any sense except that it's very funny. Even though it's not quite as well paced as the others (like ""The Man With No Name"") you're still getting the laughs from it."|0
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn up for the movie. Going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. A great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma's part. Shabana Azmi a divorcée who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister.|1
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film.|1
I saw the Messiah:- The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have seen, ever. It was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, I cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop.|1
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming, and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it.|1
"Onstage John Osborne 's adaptation of `` Picture of Dorian Gray '' is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde 's film. In fact, it does the very opposite: The movie takes place over several decades later, but with much more detail, and with a greater sense of realism. This book tells us everything that we've ever wanted to know regarding Oscar Wilde's ""picture of the year,"" in particular about his influence on television shows such as `Crazy Ex-Girlfriend', `Funny or Die', `The Big Short', and `All the President's Men'."|0
"I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment ! It is an energetic, emotional and uplifting performance that doesn't feel rushed or cheap. This movie takes a long look back on what it was like in '50s comedy. I didn't understand why I had picked up a DVD when I thought I'd have just come across this show. It's one of the few shows you will find at any point during your life. In fact, ""The Long Way Home"", the most popular show of the time, never even aired."|0
"My favorite film this year . Great characters and plot , and the direction and editing was smooth , visually stunning. I had no issue with it and was very satisfied with it as a film. If you want some action or an action-packed adventure, this is your film. It is the perfect choice for horror films that are about people taking their own life. This movie will not disappoint. No one can tell you where to start.I have always hated horror movies but in my early teens and early 20s I remember reading ""Sausage Party"" and thinking ""these guys are going to kill me!"|0
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin . There are n't much left when this train makes it into town, but after several hours or so there's nothing until the next morning at about 7.5pm. The trains were very bad in many ways. On the one hand, they took away time that could be used in building an apartment, while on the other we had to make up a lot of lost time. The only real success was in building a small shop and a place to buy groceries.|0
At first I could n't tell if it was an art film or a documentary . The day after I saw the film, though, I decided to think about it. I found myself wanting to take some time to write this review but had no luck. This film really did not have much going on. In reality it was all over the place making me question whether I should be writing this review now. As someone who watches films on DVD and Blu-rays, I can tell you that this film is awful. I've watched lots of movies on DVD so I knew its not good at all.|0
"I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see."|1
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the Cannes or other film festival and one said ""Hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria."" Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money's worth."|1
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. The costumes are great, the story lines are great, I love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. There is a great balance of good and evil. Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch.|1
"I lack cable-vision and no longer have ""DirecTV"". So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes but not blonds, I of course not only have ""Barb Wire"", but I have ""Stripperella: The Complete First Season"". I've not yet found ""VIP"" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the ""Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding"" DVD. I have the issues of ""Playboy"" that Pamela Denise Anderson posed in. I could go on. I love Pamela!"|1
`` Jaded '' takes on the complex question of abuse : the perpetrators and the victims . In lesser hands, such as this, it is easy to see why people are afraid to talk. I never expected a movie like this. It is so long, it can be very difficult to recall anything at all. There is a bit of acting in here that leaves the audience feeling more than ready for sex with some of the other actors. But I was also excited about watching a story that made me feel really good.|0
"The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short . Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a strong sense of humor, while also being able to stand apart from the rest. If this were a movie it probably wouldn't be on my list of ""must-watch"" movies. In fact, I would have no idea if I'd watch it again if I was reading this. It certainly does not deserve to appear on this list at all.I just wish someone had made a more compelling, intelligent and nuanced film about a serial killer."|0
"Recently I saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I imagine this?Or, is this part of the ""clean up"" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not ""appropriate""?I love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and I and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together."|1
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper""."|1
Unlike some of the former commentators , I was ( and am ) an avid fan of the Carpenters . There was nothing to like about this movie, it just made me want to take it out of the park. They were a total waste of time on the plot. I was completely disappointed by the movie. It really did not go very far enough to make anyone want to see this film. The story starts at the beginning of the film and does not follow through with what should have been a very entertaining conclusion.|0
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer.|1
"Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest , most clever , sharp-witted , sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I 've ever seen. It's so funny you feel sorry for them, especially the way they were portrayed when we first saw it.The only thing left to do is go back and watch it again. My favorite show this year was ""Gangnam Style"" by William H. Williams. Although not as funny as the previous ones, it wasn't bad either . The characters are very good, the setting was nice, the plot is interesting."|0
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully.One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good.|1
"""The Honkers"" is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to ""The Honkers"". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's ""Junior Bonner"" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too."|1
Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations.|1
It came before `` the ten commandments '' `` land of the Pharaohs '' `` Ben Hur '' and it was in this form. This is not a new story but it is still a little different. I can't even begin to tell you how old this movie is! It was filmed in the early 1920s, just after the beginning of WW2. So much for America's military history. What was going on when the Soviet Union attacked?The great majority of the cast were American-looking men who had worked for some time (of many years) with some of the most respected military leaders in the world.|0
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her chest so that it would leave her feeling hollow. If you're like me, you're already familiar with this film. In fact, many of my students have seen it at least once before, and I hope to see one more someday. There are only two parts: a story and a villain. There's nothing particularly memorable about the whole thing. A lot of the other characters tend to be fairly bland.|0
"wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a ""monster"" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that Alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like Lauren better!"|1
King of Queens is comic genius . Kevin James , whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny , he is the perfect actor to make you think of a TV show from 1984 or 1985 . If there was a better comedy in the 80s this would probably be it, but instead it is so awful it deserves its own category. I didn't see the original Spider-Man movie when I watched this short film on DVD. It was filmed at the very same time as The Hobbit : one of the most ridiculous films I have ever seen.|0
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie . My teen-agers enjoyed it over the first half of the film, and I am still amazed at how close they got. They were disappointed in the acting, since the music really didn't do anything for their nerves. I found myself wishing there would have been some way to make my feelings clear. It's just not an option for me! Overall, this review was very well done. This is probably the most boring movies I have seen that year.|0
"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice pronounces the words ""Puerto Rican"" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, called ""Old Acquaintance"", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other."|1
Based on Mika Waltari 's Book , This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color , beautiful action sequences with lots of acting to be enjoyed, and a great visual effects department. At the end of the film there are some funny scenes which seem to have been shot from behind in the audience's seats. I must say, I am not sure if this movie is really worth seeing. The only problem I have with this film is its lack of dialogue . You could take it anywhere, but I cannot believe that anyone would give you the chance to listen to me.|0
"*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it,I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her ""true love"" for a soap series character,Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film."|1
Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T.V. shows of its time.|1
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Park. You won't believe what I've just read but you probably wouldn't miss it unless you didn't own the book, or saw any of it.The story isn't really told, there is a lot of material going on and there are very little plot-lines. They all sound like they are trying to tell something in a different voice.I was disappointed in the end, I can see why some of the characters were taken out of their misery when they were re-introduced.|0
"Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg - ""Un ballo in maschera"" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that)."|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the Truth and Reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in developing the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions.|1
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead!This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the ""ordinary people"" type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespear's ""Midsummer Nights' Dream."" Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable."|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It's not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time!|1
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well.All too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre.|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years , Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema in this genre for at least a decade now . He is often seen as making films which are quite different from every other, perhaps because they require an element of surprise and action that no one else could offer. This year was much the opposite. In fact, if I had to choose between these movies, I wouldn't say I'd go for the Herzog-Rohmerian version. But here's the deal: The sequel is not just a horror flick - it's even a good movie.|0
Being an avid Carpenter Fan , I really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired). I've seen the movie once or twice before, and have no recollection of it being such a great film. This is a very simple premise for a thriller/drama that revolves around two young women who are thrown together from various high-rise apartments. However, they each find their own way out of each other's clutches. I saw this movie as part of a group project in the summer of 2008.|0
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect.|1
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had its strong points.|1
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and more!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and ""starring"" KANE. WWE might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park ""sport"" and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT!!"|1
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made ..... Realistic . Movies were not candy for me. The plot is about an old woman trying to get pregnant, she is stopped by a group of men who go around raping her.. She then goes to a restaurant and they tell her she needs help.. She comes back to the restaurant, has sex with some people that are there, and gets pregnant. She doesn't feel very happy when she finally takes care of the situation. What makes it worse is the ending!|0
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator.|1
I viewed The Reader at Sugar , which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything , and the movie is terrible as well. So far, only one reviewer has commented on this film, but I think we all know who to blame. What a lame excuse for what is a hilarious comedy that was directed by Charlie Brooker. The plot doesn't go anywhere. There are too many things wrong with this movie! It starts off poorly (and bad) by showing us how very stupid it is, but then you get into some weirdly funny moments that lead right back to being ridiculous.|0
Minor spoilers follow , but nothing you wo n't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a well-meaning duo, this is an extremely long story, and as such, I'd recommend that you get it straightened out in a hurry to see if you missed something or just want to watch the final act. At least not at this rate!Overall:I loved the whole film, which was one of those things that I had never seen on my own, but felt that it was missing some very interesting things.|0
"Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films , In The Company of Men & Your Friends (1994) to this film, he tries to get himself back together with some older folks. I was excited to see the new one for sure but unfortunately it only ended up having 2 sequels. I love the ""Ain't no Gonna Get Fooled"". It's just so sad that people haven't made any changes to it. I don't think I have ever been so sick and tired of watching films like these."|0
GREAT , Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen .. He acts like a child and he's not in his mid-60s or 70s when he moves from New York to Los Angeles... I'd never heard of Robin Williams, but this was by far the best story I have read. I had never seen one of the original TV shows before and for many years, I thought they would be cool. But there are still those who believe that this is a fake soap opera based on real stories.|0
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary , it is obviously a labor of love. I had been hoping that people would be more interested in learning from the creators of The Walking Dead , but now I have to say, it was very disappointing at times. There was not enough information available to truly tell the story of one of the greatest characters of all time. I really enjoyed this movie. You have no idea who was responsible for this movie or how much it affected the lives of many people.It was hard to give an example of how bad the production staff were.|0
Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can that EVER exist?|1
Fantastic documentary. A movie within a movie. I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation.|1
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by Ford favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western ""Wagon Train"" before his untimely death at age 57."|1
People need to give this show a chance . The people who write bad reviews ( there are very few people who know anything about the subject, but I guess it's because their writing is not particularly good or they have poor editing skills ) are just being ridiculous. And what more could you ask for from a movie about a bunch of men who try to get laid?I will be going to California to watch the film with my two friends who work at an auto repair shop, so I don't actually want to waste their hard-earned time here.|0
"Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper , which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines good acting with great performances. When I first saw the film I couldn't help but to imagine how excited they were that this was going to be so much bigger! It's one thing for a horror movie to pull off something like this, but then you think ""Oh wait and we can make it!"". This isn't the case! This is a horror movie made by a bunch of kids who really don't bother to watch ANYTHING in the theaters."|0
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. The unbelievable story of A GUY who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. Gosh, is this what life made us be? People deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? ""Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore""."|1
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . I think these films are going to be a waste of money and time on this list, because I don't even consider them Westerns... but that's exactly what I am saying.Tombstone is basically a story about a family in their mid-twenties with no hope of making it big in the next decade; they've been forced to travel all over the country to get their life together and make money for themselves. One day one of them breaks into their house and goes looking for a job.|0
There are many film now on DVD , but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers . This is no surprise, given the state of things in Japan. I have watched several Japanese films with English subtitles. A great movie! Unfortunately it doesn't quite add up and the story wasn't quite as interesting as expected. The only redeeming thing about this movie is that there is no real action or suspense in it. If you don't like suspense movies, then this one is for you. What could possibly go wrong?|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me . I loved Orry and George Carlin, they are just not funny anymore. This is hilarious. It makes us think that in life, we only have one bad idea to tell the others. And yet here we are. The film has an absurdly low-brow plot because it starts off poorly, then ends horribly. But it doesn't really end well at all. We learn that the man who killed his wife, whom she was trying to kill for money, had stolen the money.|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts . This one was leaps and bounds better in quality than what you get when you buy this. I was looking for a movie about people that have a hard time sleeping. It wasn't worth the price. I didn't even bother to make a reservation. Instead, I sat with my friends and started to enjoy it. The premise of this film is simple - people who just can't make it through all day don't see the upside of being able to sleep at night.|0
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October, 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX."" So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative Orange County.Thirty two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store."|1
I liked this a lot. The camera angles are cool, it's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with the Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Plenty of people were shouting at the screen! Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. He's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes.Kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations.|1
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond.|1
`` Two Hands '' is an entertaining , funny story about Australian lowlifes . The screenplay contrasts the world of Hollywood with Australia in which the film has a lot of money, attention and passion for its target audience - people from all backgrounds who are willing to sacrifice their life to make it worthwhile. It shows that this country is far less than we have been led to believe.What could go wrong?A comedy is just another excuse to get involved in politics or something. If you're not a big fan of American movies then you've probably got some bad luck here.|0
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case.|1
Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes German's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.In typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany,preferably in original language!|1
"I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has ! It was funny and the humor was still good. The only thing I really hate about this film is that it did not take into account his father, who played a major part in the plot . I remember one night when I was sitting in my living room listening to music by an older man, he got very bored and started asking people where they were. He asked me ""where are you?"" and I jumped up and said, ""what is that?"""|0
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year . It was a truly moving experience .I just saw what it looked like and I knew there was so much going on, but when it came to the acting, I can't wait for it to reach my hands into my chest and let me go.The acting wasn't horrible at all..except maybe for the poor lighting and terrible music.If you want to see an action movie - that means watching it in its original setting. The acting is decent but the acting didn't do anything special.|0
"Having just got the ""Loony Tunes Golden Collection""(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.Rabbit Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being ""Rabbit Fire"" and ""Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and Daffy argue about who Elmer Fudd should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!"|1
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox 's reluctance to release a sequel based on The Dark Knight and the Last Jedi. It is one of the few films you will never see, not even in theaters. I can't speak for any of the writers or filmmakers involved in The Dark Knight's development, but they must be very aware of what movie fans are thinking. In many ways it is obvious that there is something here that is beyond mere conjecture. And with that said, it is hard to blame anyone for wanting to see this film.|0
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made, ""Murder in the Music Hall"" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. A shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious Rockettes--among them, Vera Ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delectable B-movie starlets of the '40s."|1
This is definitely an excellent show . I do n't have cable , so I started renting them , because of course it wasn't supposed to be. I had a few questions about this show and how it ended up on IMDB, but I really found it hard to believe that a show made by a guy who doesn't know his stuff could ever get past a top 10. I was hoping he would give the story some thought, or at least make some sense of it. This show has no logic whatsoever. At one point throughout the storyline there is nothing else to be seen.|0
I just watched this movie on it 's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia . I liked (for me at least) the scene that was filmed over the course of ten days. Here you see a young man in an alley, dressed like a thug, who runs for his life, and tries to escape with his girlfriend. His girlfriend calls him and asks him to let her know that she can't come back home. He insists that she stop calling him and says she doesn't know what's wrong. She then pulls out a gun and shoots herself.|0
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny ( and fun ) puns . The first shot we see in the film, is an ""Oooh!"" moment. It doesn't really look like anyone's looking out for one other than the cameraman. It seems pretty clear why he has to have done it: because of a lack of effort on his part.I'm not saying that these movies aren't funny. Not by a long shot. They are, in fact, actually great films.The bad guys were probably too much trouble to even put together."|0
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago . I 've seen it 4 times already and had never really seen one of the films. Well now I am finally going to go out on a limb here and tell you that there are spoilers ahead in terms of the story. So let's take a look at what happened next before the end credits roll. First off, my first thoughts were ""wow wow! This is something that I thought I would never see again after this film!! It must be the worst film I've ever seen!"|0
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; ""We're Men in tights!"""|1
Well , I 'm a few days late but what the hell .... ! Anyways , the word that best describes her character is how much fun she is. This book was an absolute steal! Not only did it showcase her talents in the field of fashion, but even though we can't go into details here, I'm sure she's got some great talent on her hands as well. You have to read this book for a while because you won't be able to enjoy the action and characters at all.|0
"Awww , I love this ! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon does n't really need an synopsis so long as it contains a bit of information that you don't get much more than a brief synopsis. For me, ""The Book of Esther"" is my favorite novel in all of modern art.I can't say it enough :) This novel is well done by its creators. The main story is actually quite nice, but not too good either. That being said there is a couple moments where it just seems wrong to take such a big twist on a plot like this."|0
Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin? The years of hard work paid off in what is, without question, one of the best documentaries ever created.The sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, are rare and haven't even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know'.Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode.|1
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in Spain on DVD under the name ""Algo Mas Que Amigos"" and you can buy there it is in English and Spanish on the DVD....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't Released to The U.S Market."|1
I love to see a female protagonist , in this movie her name was Rose . Rose brought out a lot of characters who she knew and liked but didn't like. It's almost as if Rose is just taking them from the other side of the world, into another dimension where their true selves exist. This movie I'm not saying it's boring...it isn't! I think it's really bad. This movie is good enough that you'll want to pay extra because it is so funny. The plot is predictable and the writing is solid.|0
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because I work at a company a lot like IPS, (DHL) and we just love the Teamster plugs!! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur well what can you say? He just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things.|1
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford 's work . Mainly because it 's the only one of these two that's actually made in Mexico. But this isn't really all about Mexican films and I'm not talking about what the film has to say or how good the production can become. What I am talking about is the kind of action-packed suspense you won't see in your local Mexican theater. The story unfolds with little plot, almost as if you were reading from a book. So there are more than a few jokes thrown in, which would be a shame.|0
This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe . Notice how some of the Roman sets look quite different from the other movies they were shooting, but the characters are still as good as if made up. It's funny because most of the actors in these films had already seen The Matrix before, so you can imagine the level of care and commitment that went into getting the movie done. I would say that the first film was pretty dull, but then there was another one that made me laugh out loud just to see it all again.|0
In Mississippi , the former blues man Lazarus ( Samuel L. Jackson ) is in crisis , missing his wife and two sons, who he has gone to church with for a meeting. One day at a funeral on Saturday, a little over a hundred people attend a funeral service at which there is an interment in the middle of the cemetery. When they return to their graveside graveside seats, they discover a dead corpse lying on the ground beneath them. After having tried to get away from it, the young man decides to try again.|0
"Well ..... I would n't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I've heard over and over again at this place. Its not very good, it seems like every time you see someone talk about their favorite movie, they have to make some sort of attempt to convince you otherwise. The movie was really terrible and even worse in terms of the pacing. There was a LOT of CGI in the opening scenes, but there wasn't much other CGI or music either. I've seen many movies called ""Gloria"", and I'm all for the action and gore-laden characters."|0
"This was an excellent show . It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (who has been a part of many shows such as ""All The Way"") telling me that it's time for her to leave the land of the free.I guess if you were looking for an example where this movie fails to get anywhere near as far as success, this film would be my best choice. You can check out the full documentary here . If there are any sequels to this movie before this one, please let me know. Cindy Herron's script is incredibly entertaining."|0
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. In addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.Highly recommended.|1
"With all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on ""Romeo and Juliet""? Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to them.Yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. Eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it."|1
Despite all it 's trappings of style and cinematic invention , this is basically another serial killer thriller , following the exploits of a mysterious woman. I'm sorry if you've been to this movie before, but after listening to this film you'll get used to the fact that it never actually happened . I would have seen it if I wasn't in the know about it, and I couldn't imagine anyone getting into the mindset of someone with no clue what the plot was, nor did anyone ever attempt anything remotely daring to hide their disappointment.|0
I couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.|1
The philosophical , meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind . I 'd give it 10 stars if it weren't so bad. The film was very well conceived, the plot worked and the actors all had a lot of fun. There is nothing in the way of action that makes you want to watch it, but for some reason, the director doesn't think much of it. It would be more interesting to see how he managed to bring this to the screen...but alas. After watching this movie I got hooked on the characters and the world.|0
With Nurse Betty ( 2000 ) , acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute ( In the Company of Men , Your Life in Pieces , The Girlfriend Story ) and a new addition to the cast of Doctor Who, David Tennant is back to make his return as Doctor Who's companion. As the original Doctor, Tennant returns as the son of a man who dies in battle. This week we take a brief look at two of the most beloved character movies ever made: 'The Little Red Riddle', starring J.K.Rowling (2001) and John Hurt (2005).|0
"Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome ; more bloodshed and very graphic details ( a bit too much violence) in certain scenes of the movie which is why I didn't get to see the rest of it. As I've written before, one of the many things that you will find on IMDb page for ""Kurt Vonnegut"", or any other good book, film or television director is the soundbite of his own voice. It is an utter lack of professionalism. You can listen to him sing and laugh at his work, but you have no clue what he actually does or thinks."|0
* * SPOILERS AHEAD * * It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch itself as unoriginal. We've been waiting for this one for some time, and we were disappointed by the lackluster production values. I mean, how could they make a movie that was supposed to be great? This film tells the entire story of three young boys trying to get a job at an independent company. But it has nothing to do with acting or music. To the contrary there are absolutely no actors/guitarists/museums/etc who actually play any of these parts.|0
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.|1
"Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award . It was an absolute delight! The plot isn't terribly interesting. I didn't really like it, even though I think it was a pretty good movie and I would have liked to see it more than once but I wasn't able to find one of the cast or actors I liked very much. Even after watching it (I don't know what they are called ""films"") I wanted to go back for some other things to see."|0
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. To have it totally wash over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is at once forbidding, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies within!|1
"I 'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5 , but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 star rating for the rest of my review.. This film was a disaster in terms of quality and enjoyment. It is hard to understand why one who has watched this movie might not agree with its portrayal of a teenager's struggles to stay away from porn. It does, however, have a lot of comedy. There were moments of violence that made you think ""how could they possibly use this? ""."|0
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are coming to sell goods for the sake of saving the Mormon Church. After they go through various scenarios, the Mormon leader decides that no one else is interested in them and leaves the group. The group arrives at the church on the morning of the first Sunday in October where they spend the rest of the week there. This is not what Mormonism looks like today. The main character doesn't have a lot of charisma as he has a rather low personality.|0
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there . Alright , more than a little ... but it's hard to find a movie that does the job perfectly. There is just something so silly and pointless here that it can get even stranger on the Internet.I would probably give it 5 stars if they were as bad as the reviews. It doesn't have much substance, but it's still funny. First of all, you are missing out on something truly awesome. The original version of this film was released in 1993, and had an incredibly high budget.|0
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist , I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out of Hollywood in about three months. Here are five films I watched that made me want to come back to see this movie. So, let me make it simple. If you're not yet familiar with ""Ghostbusters"", the film starring Chris Evans is one of those movies where there is no real suspense. It takes place two decades later, when we first meet the main characters and start to realize how evil they are."|0
In dramatising Wilde 's novel , John Osborne has condensed events , eliminated a number of characters , and generally looked like a dull mess. The plot isn't very interesting to me, as I've never heard anyone write a novel that is not based around this idea . I'll admit it for a while now: there's something about George W. Bush that goes straight to the heart of his character. But, at one point, I really wanted to believe he was an intelligent person who lived in London. He had good acting but lacked the intelligence to become a leader in the United States.|0
I haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was busting for the loo; and I didn't even want to pause it because I was drawn right in. Emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. It gives you an amazing insight to South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; I was captivated.|1
One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot but I was pleasantly surprised at this film, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway.|1
I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience which shows up on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story.|1
"Wagon Master ( 1950 ) Dir : John Ford Production : Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the action-packed thriller ""King of the Jungle"" to the big screen, and it's one of the saddest movies that we've seen before. The characters aren't as clever, and their motivations are just a little out of place. They're trying to do what they've never thought possible, so they try to get away with things from each other. I have to admit that I was disappointed when I watched this film."|0
Renee Zellweger is Betty , a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse , who is infatuated with a baby girl and tries to turn her into a doctor. It is during this time that we see the movie's ending, when Betty suddenly falls ill. This is one of the best horror movies I have watched in ages. I wish it was as bad as this one. The plot was terrible but the characters were nice enough to not get me killed at all (although I am still fairly upset by them).|0
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, like The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California. Along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some Navajos.|1
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!|1
Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality.|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years . I rate it one of those films I love to watch while I am at home. The production values are excellent and all the performances are very funny, even when they're poorly acted or poorly written. You don't expect an actor with such a good acting record to get along with other actors he/she meets. What you find here is quite a different story from what goes on in movies where the director tries to show how this kind of stuff can happen.|0
I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area , and it was quite clear that most of the scenes were very boring. The music, however, kept coming back to life every time you turned your head.It may seem like a pity for the movie, but I just can't help myself. It had been two hours with so many plot points that they weren't even remotely relevant - all of which are well-intentioned (especially the beginning). Then again, why would anyone ever care for a movie that could make you want to stop crying over an hour long movie?|0
"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun."|1
"This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with."|1
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.We will enjoy the movie again!|1
George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites . The unsung hero of his generation . Nobody would have guessed the level of genius and character he made out of this. First off, what a nice book! There was so much going on there that you almost thought it was just some sort of prequel story. This one really didn't make much sense as to why this was the case - I guess we could go back and watch a bit further and see where they came up with their original idea (they actually changed the first episode), but at least it wasn't all bad.|0
"This is a `` revised '' Riverdance presentation , staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City .'' It appears to have been released on September 6, 1996. On September 20, 1996, ""Honey Badger"" hit theaters with one of its best performances. It has since become the definitive rock musical of the 21st century (although it does have some serious flaws). The second half of the album features an appearance by James Earl Jones where he plays Bob Dylan (as well as other singers from the original songs)."|0
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story , Like someone you might have known . Just trying to find the right time.I mean I've read an awful lot of books in the past few years, but I don't know what happened to them . I saw the first one on my phone last night and it turned out to be a horror story . It was like 'the world has come back into its old life.' That being said , I'm sure it's going to be a lot more fun watching the movie than seeing the rest of it again.|0
Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much . The theme was well handled by the Director with great direction. It is definitely one of the most beautiful movies to ever come out of cinema. I have been trying to watch this movie for a while, but I couldn't resist my excitement when I finally got the opportunity (and that's exactly what it was after I saw the film at the theatre). The action sequences just don't work. The dialogue is horrible, and the character descriptions are bad. Overall, a mediocre movie.|0
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed . Very funny and the production quality is outstanding . It is quite easy to be a moviegoer and I found myself watching this on my computer screen when i came across it online. As someone who can't wait any more to see a film like The Dark Knight Rises, I can't wait to see all these little kids play with this kind of technology. Unfortunately, I was never able to find one where this would work.. I love movies about teenagers in their 20s and 50s, which is exactly the impression that many young people give themselves when they watch them.|0
"I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. Most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. I saw the ""twist"" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie.But what really stood out to me was the direction."|1
"I 'm a fan of independent film . Dialogue driven , character study pieces are where it 's at for an indie movie. A lot of people will call your work ""boring"", but if they get the chance to see it, I'd rather you watch it through some sort of screen camera instead. Don't expect that to happen in my opinion since it looks like a bunch of amateur actors (except for one guy with glasses). The movie's plot isn't interesting at all. The story is just plain awful."|0
I was drawn to `` Friends '' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous actor (Michael B. Jordan, who also appeared in that film). That said, this is not a good movie. While it might be entertaining for kids, you don't really know how to make them feel when you watch it. The main character has some serious problems, and even worse, his father is an alcoholic.The acting was decent. The story went well with humor and interesting characters. I have seen lots of sitcoms about alcoholism, most of which had the same plot point.|0
Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / did n't understand this wonderful film . What a sad life he must have gotten here. It's like one of those things where I'm so depressed because I think there is someone else in my life that doesn't seem to get what I'm getting. It is a good movie. If you want to know how to tell a story, or an allegory, you will love this. There are other films which are good and worth looking at. I can't recommend them enough. First of all the writing was bad.|0
I got this movie with my BBC `` Jane Austen Collection '' ( 5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations ) and I'm glad it was in theaters. As I mentioned before, the story does a great job of illustrating the many problems that can be overcome by not adapting to an original television series. The best part about this movie is that even though it is based upon true sources, its main character is also a young boy. At first glance he seems much younger than he really is. After a while we see how different he gets from other characters and their personalities.|0
First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria.But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. Al Gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on peoples opinions of the man.|1
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. If I remember correctly we had to watch it on a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days UHF not part of regular TV to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk. A great memory from 50+ years ago.|1
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.The first time I saw this, I cried from laughing so hard. Everything about it is funny.While ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by ""Real Genius""), it ranks way up there in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over Cary Elwes."|1
'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality.|1
As Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del ( Aaron Eckhart ) being murdered by a group of terrorists. The plot thickens in the last episode. What could possibly go wrong? We see that Betty has some sort of problem with the cops, so they decide to kidnap him, but he never gets around to killing himself! However, it can be said that the police will try and scare Betty into not killing herself when she tries to get out of jail. This is where the main flaw of this movie lies.|0
Surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though I don't agree with the notion that when you do Erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe. But that's just me.|1
It has been recorded that John Ford made the `` big , blockbuster '' movies so that he could afford to buy some of his more expensive children's toys in return. I've not read much about this movie and if you did, please don't waste any time reading about it. For the sake of being honest with myself, I haven't seen it as a movie since it premiered on DVD in 2000. I just came back from my holiday trip to Europe last week and was surprised to get a message from one of my very close friends.|0
"I like movies that show real people ""Americans"" and tell truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that it's USA/Canda but the box states ""All Regions"". I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it."|1
"The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off . It is the second entry in a series of books from the same author that focuses on a very young couple who find themselves in a strange ""life-or-death situation"" when they go back to their mother. One of the main reasons for my dislike of this film is because it's so much worse than the first, even though it isn't exactly terrible either (it seems like every time you watch it, you'll see some kind of evil monster lurking in plain sight)."|0
"First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies , and this is actually the second time in my life I haven't seen it. In fact...I was so excited when we met, to see what could be coming out in the first few weeks that I forgot to mention the name of the film. When we went for the movie on DVD, I immediately felt a strange sensation at seeing the title. I think this may have been because I was surprised to see the title ""The Man Who Knows Best""."|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker . This is the only flick that I know about, because it doesn't get into the movie either. It would be so much fun if we were able to jump back and watch it while sitting in our hotel suite. My first impressions of this movie were not bad at all. First of all I don't remember ever watching this film until I saw the movie in theaters. For me it's a shame that I didn't get my copy of the original version for some reason.|0
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in ""Desk Set"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in ""Nanny & the Professor""."|1
"Surprisingly good made for T.V. Thriller. I wasn't expecting too much from this one but I'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. It's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.The background story of Thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.The ""stranger"" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society."|1
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we 're in a bigger hole than ever . That 's a problem. It has to stop before it gets worse. What are you going to do when one of your guys comes out with this idea? There's no better way to kill somebody than by stabbing them to death. The fact that there's such a huge difference between killing an American and shooting a Japanese soldier doesn't even make sense! I can imagine someone getting stabbed to death, but if they didn't know exactly what he was doing they would never get stabbed.|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic.|1
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works.|1
I'm not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. She's a loyal friend and always the peace maker.|1
"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, ""Friends"" goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences."|1
The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! We have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. Its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system.|1
"A train holding union soldiers is transporting $ 300,000 of gold , along with a banker Clayton , who 's going to take it from here on out. The entire movie ends with him throwing up in a bathtub .The only other scene that actually makes sense in the plot is when Clayton says ""This is gonna be good for us all!"". I'm not sure why he would do this but I suppose he could have said what he wanted instead of acting like a maniac at the beginning. Also, the dialogue in the video is awful and the camera angles are bad."|0
This was a pretty good episode . Though no `` Trapped in the Closet '' or `` Cartoon Wars , this was a really good episode! The first time I saw The Dark Tower was with my wife when I was 10 years old. There was no way that it could be such a bad movie--this is one of the worst I've seen all year on TV. A young man (Michael C. Hall) decides to do something terrible for some reason, but he finds out that he and his girlfriend aren't friends anymore...so he runs away from the scene.|0
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. A true, polished, diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character ""Conrack"") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. At first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home."|1
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I.|1
"I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a ""typical"" human alike or different than Rose? Lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy?"|1
"After ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type."|1
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it . What a movie . I am still very happy with how good it is to watch it. I just finished reading this review and couldn't get past the first sentence. If anyone had anything to say, let it be ""Why?"". Not because I don't agree with everything it says. I can see where you draw the line between ""it sucks"" and ""it's all for naught"". But I think it has at least gotten me out of my seat."|0
I like movies that show real people `` Americans '' and tell truth . The movie is simple and that's all we need.If you want to understand this movie, read on... This was the first novel I thought of when I read a couple of reviews about it. This was an excellent story with a wonderful cast. If you don't mind paying attention, there isn't much else here that will interest you.The plot revolves around a young French girl who has had a childhood dream. She dreams of one day becoming an astronaut and landing on the moon.|0
"I really like this show . It has drama , romance , and comedy all rolled into one . I am going to watch it again in a heartbeat . This film contains a lot of great characters and some nice acting throughout. But there are many other things missing here. If I were to compare it to anything, it would be a sequel to ""Mysteries in the Land"" (2000). I don't believe I've ever seen a movie like this made in my life. So let's take a moment to talk a little about this movie."|0
"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called ""Good"". We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship."|1
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work.|1
I'm certain that people from USA don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the USA. The only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the USA and Islamic nations. In France, for instance, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it's 14. In Spain it's 12. So the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal.|1
it 's the best movie i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! ! i just love them ! (I'm so sorry i didn't do that in my book) and i can't speak for everyone else at all - but i thought it might be interesting to hear some comments on other reviewers or review sites, since it is not such a bad film ! This is one of the worst films i have ever seen. The story is awful and the music is unbearable. I must admit i don't like watching horror movies because i find it to be pretty boring.|0
Hallelujah ! ! ! ! Finally , a true Colombian film crosses the border ( s ) to shows how the US is using this movie. I mean, no one in Colombia has ever seen a Mexican blockbuster like this before, let alone witnessed it . I'm on a date and decided to have an affair with a guy. He wasn't interested at first because I thought that he was boring or something but when I realized that I wanted him to get drunk, I started asking if I could take his car.|0
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film. If I had to pick my favorite movie from it, it probably would have been The Last of Us , but this is one of those films which seems like it would be quite good in its own right. The story is very loosely developed, so there is always an element or two where someone thinks that something is wrong because they don't know what happened, and then they are forced to save their family when they die.The main problem is that the characters are not even believable.|0
"Don't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV just to watch their newest movies. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even till this day when one mentions the song ""Susie Q"" I always remember the movie."|1
I do n't usually like to see movies while they 're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but this one really does disappoint us. I could see myself doing this again with the next film. I think this is probably the most disappointing installment of my family history. There are several reasons why: it's not the kind of movie that you would want young girls to make and it doesn't feature much action. And even if you liked the original series, this didn't impress me. The character development is pretty mediocre. The screenplay isn't good either.|0
"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should watch it. After all I did love ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en"", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of ""The Cell"". The whole story concept is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in."|1
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song."|1
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up ""pronoun trouble"" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I've laughed at since I was a kid."|1
First of all - I 'm not one to go all sappy over movies . I saw Friends in the first half of 1978 , which is why I wrote this note. I watched it on DVD at that time and have never looked back. I don't know what happened afterwards, but I can't get behind it anymore. This movie looks like a classic, but there's really no plot. The story starts off pretty slow, but quickly escalates out of control. What happens? Why would you even bother watching this film if it could make you sick?|0
An extremely down-to-earth , well made and acted `` Rodeo '' Western . No gussied up stars needed here as most of the cast were poor in their own way but had no idea what they were about to find out. It really did feel a little cheap at times - you have to admit there was not even a hint of plot in this story! The only other thing I didn't like was the music...I think its bad, but since this show is so slow it probably isn't going to get me through any episodes at all. I enjoyed watching this series.|0
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross. When it's time to film, it doesn't really matter, because you still have a lot more money to spend. It seems like this movie would be best if the actors were on their own. I'm a huge George Lucas fan and I've seen this movie twice already but I always feel that the films are not much better. The story was very simplistic as well, which is something we never really got to see in this franchise.|0
I could n't believe the eye candy from start to finish . Being a fan of movies directed by music nerds, I really had my eyes on this one! Not only did it stand out from everyone else for its good acting, but it also gave me some great laugh lines in every scene where you could see what's up. This movie made me laugh and think. The opening is pretty awesome (even though it was just two minutes long) but after that it wasn't funny at all. A lot of the dialogue was awkward, not funny, etc.|0
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film 's lead character, Tippett (Marlene Van Houten) whose mother died in an automobile accident during the first half of her life. She has also been seen as a prostitute by her father after she tries to get him to let her out of his home with her.Tippett may not have been able to pull off such a spectacular and tragic escape, but it was still pretty awesome! I would like to say that there is something really special about these movies.|0
The most beautiful film . If one is looking for serious depth , meaning and excellent performance then you have to find it. In the past I've always been a little disappointed that so many people looked at some of these films, though there are plenty of interesting films with good writing and acting. But no, this is NOT a story about love, sex, drugs and violence. You know what I mean? It's an extremely bad piece of trash.It doesn't tell the whole story in any meaningful way.|0
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch . She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of her brother, and after watching this movie she thought I would give this a 5. The acting is excellent, and the performances were great (except when you consider that they were supposed to be a parody). A few other reviews say that this film sucks, but no one has ever come close to saying what kind of director he is anymore. It's like an 80's horror movie with no chemistry whatsoever.|0
"I 've seen 'nurse betty ' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea 'and thought that it was so strange to see all of them, I just sat down and said, 'Well, why not?' It would have been really cool. It was just a bunch of guys who went out for lunch and they got paid for it. You don't get paid for that."" As far as sex goes, he doesn't see any difference between male-to-female transsexuals and those who choose to be female."|0
"I'm a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. Some of the other posts are right: ""Wannabes"" isn't going to rival ""The Godfather"" for best mob film ever. On the other hand, ""Wannabes"" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. My problem with one of the other reviews:- Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians- Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman."|1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about Black middle class families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many...many people who still talk about the show. If it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer-pressure and much more.|1
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the Justin and Madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine, and accurate. The costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. I dearly love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American History, and I love movies about it.|1
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat , but as the film progresses we discover that they are completely different characters. The acting isn't good enough for me, so I didn't like seeing this movie at all. I don't think it has much in common with other movies that try to put actors in scenes where the actors aren't available, so I thought this would be a great choice for an indie movie of its own. Stopped by to watch ""Ladies and Gentlemen"" and decided to give it 5 stars because I knew what I was getting into."|0
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago.|1
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s and a big hit. I got my copy back in 1999 as I was looking forward to seeing it on screen for myself. I wasn't really interested, but thought I could pick up what I would have read in the local paper: It was written by a man who had spent a good part of his adult life with his wife (a model). The screenplay was based on a novel that he wrote in 1976, which was later adapted into a film called The Golden Road.|0
"My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released . The controversy that surrounded the original release was caused mainly by a misunderstanding of what was being said there. After the movie became popular with both men and woman, many people started questioning the movie as if it was an accurate portrayal of the homosexual sex culture in the United States. In order to get his views on homosexuality removed from Hollywood, David Blaine (Bruce Willis) wrote a letter saying that the movie ""is a complete waste of film-making funds and money""."|0
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight , he lives in this burned down old hotel , where eight teenaged boys die in one night. In the name of revenge, he kills them all with knives, shotguns and an assault rifle. You can't help but want to know exactly what happened on TV. But how could it possibly be that the show was filmed in a place that didn't have a bathroom? How could there possibly be something out there that got rid of everyone who lived there? And if anything, it made no sense?|0
Most of these reviews are dead on , so I 'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of my questions later, but this post has got me thinking a little bit more than I already thought. This game is by far the worst you could ever find! You never know what's coming in the box. You've never even seen an original story like this before with such awful graphics and no dialogue. It feels as if you're just waiting for something to go wrong, until something does go wrong, and suddenly you can't help but give up your attention.|0
`Skenbart' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945, which it does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'Gunnar' played by the, in Sweden, famous actor Gustav Hammarsten.|1
America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately i have become bored with it.cycle 1: yeah I'm happy Adrienne won, i wanted her to win from the beginning.cycle 2: its too bad, i think Mercedes deserved it.cycle 3: i did not like Eva, but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle.cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. i don't know what they saw in Naima, but i definitely know what they saw in Kahlen.cycle 5: like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either.|1
"Just see it ! It 's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time . See it again :-P
I was just sitting in my car waiting for a friend who had a few questions. She has some interesting things to say to me: ""What can you tell me about the current situation in India? And how do you plan on dealing with them? What will be your opinion of their behavior in the next decade? The whole point of Indian cinema is to tell a very honest story, and I like that this one is telling a very personal story."""|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . And I can't help wondering if the phrase was meant to say ""Blue"" or ""White,'' because most of us would be pretty sure a lot of people would find out who it was. (I mean, don't think there were any other words that could be taken as an example.) I suppose they were just trying to get at the bottom of some of the mysteries that lurk around the country."|0
After getting hooked on the mini series , `` North & South , '' I could hardly wait for the end. The show was fun, but sadly one of those shows that would get you through your entire life without even talking about what's going on. What made this film so special, is the way its characters were portrayed. Most of them never came close to being human at all. They didn't tell the story in a good way, and there are many scenes where it's obvious why someone would act like they'd be funny.|0
What can I say? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule.MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.But be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a gruesome film.|1
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms , I thought I would get them all done now. I think the main complaint from this show is its pacing. Everything goes downhill from there. At times it takes a while to make sense of what is actually going on but then it just becomes an endless cycle of events. The most important part of this story is the fact that one of the three main characters is kidnapped. There is absolutely no excuse for the character in question to stay prisoner and watch over the rest of his family; he has nothing to offer.|0
I have n't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way. I love this movie, especially if it is based on real people's stories. It made me smile even though I'm not quite ready to say why. It was also an interesting idea at the beginning but it wasn't something that I needed anymore. This movie is one of those movies that makes its home in Hollywood by having some really good acting talent. The actors who play the characters are well-developed and know how to work with each others' skills and emotions.|0
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately:Nicolas Roeg (dir)--Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.Charles Sturridge--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing.|1
When this show first came on the air , I saw it once or twice and thought it was another episode. It had nothing to do with politics in any way, but just about every other thing that happened in the world. Now I understand why you'd want to go through all of that before you actually watch this. It's just one of those things that just makes you think...I guess I don't know where else to start reading this.I also have to admit that when I started watching this series, I couldn't help but get bored of the characters.|0
"Ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! ""Just Before Dawn"" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. It's a hell of a lot of fun.I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. ""Wrong Turn"" ripped this movie off something fierce! There's plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch."|1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clichéd but still true, know what I'm saying.I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I'm more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France.|1
My favorite film this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. Set in Barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired.|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I've just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast, they are so funny.|1
I saw the movie in 1972 , and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went back, this is a complete disappointment. For one, the ending is so wrong as to be impossible to understand. If you haven't done so yourself, do it now, at least take some notes. The dialogue is poor, the music is loud, the characters seem to speak in tongues, they are very funny, and the plot is quite easy to understand.The acting is not good enough. There were no actors capable of portraying a character with such a low production value.|0
"Strange enough , shorts like this get a 10 . Why ? They are hilarious . This is hilarious . This is one of the most entertaining shorts I have ever seen in my life. I think it has some good moments, but they are so low key that you cannot tell apart them from other funny shorts out there. The premise of the shorts is simple to understand and quite humorous. In fact, the only real reason why this movie is being considered ""best shorts ever"" is that it is a great comedy short."|0
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect . Here Alice is a little overjoyed at finding herself in a place filled with other women. I must admit, I was so shocked to read this book during my first reading. The main plot is centered around an American woman who's trying to find a good boyfriend for her young husband. As soon as she sees her husband's name in his address, she tries to think of what she would have to do to make it through this whole ordeal.|0
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera.|1
I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo.|1
It happens often , while growing up , a Hollywood movie impresses a youth . It not only lasts a few minutes, it ends with the kid's father coming home to find out that he found the film in his library. I've written before about how difficult it is to write good stories and I've mentioned many times that some people who write bad movies aren't very creative. So what is really important to me as a writer is to be able to tell interesting stories from the perspectives of the characters you write.|0
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland , and it was my favorite movie I've been fortunate enough to see over the last couple of years. The story takes place during a war between the USA and the USSR, which starts with the Soviet Union bombing the US-China border. There are many battles fought between the two sides throughout the movie, but one particular battle is particularly important. This is one of those episodes where you're trying to fight off an enemy that's just about to jump out of the plane.|0
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. It really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the Aussie humor. They portray it very well and very realistically.|1
"""L'Auberge Espagnole"" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. And it is wise by the way. ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona."|1
I 'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things . However , SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of film, and one that I wish to see again. The story is interesting but it just isn't as compelling as it should have been. There are a few scenes where we are given a choice, and then we are left to wonder if the characters will ever be able to make up their mind.The movie was very entertaining in my opinion. I enjoyed every minute of it. The pacing was slow and boring. I could understand why someone would take the time to watch this so closely.|0
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe , grappa , aramangac or jungle juice some of the other movie stars had left in their wake . After all, they might as well have taken a couple hours to see The Wizard Of Oz. For those of you who don't believe I'm an Englishman and therefore do not understand English (or even know where to start with this argument ), I shall give you two options: 1) try to say ""Oh! That was terrible!"" and 2) take me out of context."|0
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. I have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk.i saw this right off Disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie.|1
I absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: I am from Romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on USA TV I check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I become to know absolutely everything about them I looked on the internet what's Rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria.|1
Come on . Anyone who does n't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's page. It is so stupid it must be laughable.I have seen it before and I think you can see the difference in it.This is not a comedy or anything. There are enough words to tell you what you really need to know. This movie tries to convince you that if you like comedy, you will like this movie. It just doesn't work well with other people because of how dumb it is. I wish they'd done better at making funny movies.|0
wow ! i just have to say this show is super cool ! i fell in love with the show and i'll always be there to see more. This was an amazing one from start to finish. It was really funny at times as well, and it did not come across like a bad movie. Even when you're talking about some sort of big budget drama, if you know what you are talking about, most people would enjoy the story rather than try to watch it out of their mouths. The first few minutes (the ones that I've watched) were kind of dull.|0
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes.|1
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word.|1
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of ""We've Only Just Begun"" and Karen's marriage troubles admirably (the ""Superstar"" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitar solos, etc. Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter's personality."|1
The show is GREAT . No words to describe it . Wonderful music . Incredible dance . The editors could not believe that they were in for a real treat of this quality. The only negative things about the movie are that it's hard to watch while sitting on the toilet and watching it, so you have to watch it during the whole ordeal. It might be one of the worst movies ever made, but I will say this: it has nothing to recommend it. My boyfriend and I both liked this show at first as we found it interesting and well-thought-out.|0
This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. I think that women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they act on it. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not.|1
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, Land of the Pharaohs"". The sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so ""neat"" in the production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have yet to see the 1999 movie ""The Mummy but am sure I will love it!"|1
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.The trailer of ""Nasaan ka man"" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role."|1
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of `` Rawhide '' Charles Marquis Warren . The film (which is directed by Jack Gleeson, an Oscar-winner) has many references to Native American culture but lacks even any significant plot twist. It is one of those films that will make it easy for anyone in the viewing public to overlook this movie. I highly recommend it
I've been a huge fan of David Lean's work and thought that his original screenplay would be enough of a storyteller to create a memorable picture."|0
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. However, ""JBD"" delivers considerably more.Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil."|1
"This movie has a lot to recommend it . The paintings , the music , and David Hewlett 's nakedness are some of my favorite parts.I was hoping to go back and watch it, as this is a film that I enjoyed in its entirety (it had all the trappings of a horror/horror thriller.) In the end though, I just couldn't get enough enjoyment out of it anyway. One of the worst reviews I've ever read. People say ""You can't see anything"" at first, but I'm completely convinced they don't exist."|0
"Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare , but Fata Morgana is a good case . You can chalk up all her acting to the lack of real emotion that she delivers, but there really was nothing more irritating than this performance in the worst possible way. This film simply didn't provide any kind of emotional support and it doesn't even do its job adequately.This film also fails miserably at its goal of telling a moving story from one man to another
This film should be seen by everyone. There is never a point when you want to make a movie with this type of focus."|0
I saw `` The Reader '' at a film festival in Manhattan this week . It touched my heart in many ways. There are two major differences between the two movies: one of them is centered on an aging cast; and the other is about younger actors trying to make their way into Hollywood. Well, what exactly is the difference? Why do I think they both got off so easily? First, there's a big plot hole in the original movie which goes nowhere near as far as making it believable as it would otherwise. There are also minor plot holes in the original film.|0
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south . The story follows a group of mercenaries who travel around the planet searching for information on a strange alien species.The plot is fairly self explanatory since the characters are very generic and nothing interesting to look at. It also makes no sense if the aliens are any different from real humans in appearance or physical form. Their behavior is all over the place and even their weapons are not good enough to fight. I don't think this is a bad movie. There are many things about this film that could make it work.|0
If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... Right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... Identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful.|1
"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""the murder mystery"", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced)."|1
This film was made soon enough after Karen's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children.|1
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had there strong points.|1
The `` Hunting Trilogy '' of Rabbit Fire ( 1951 ) , Rabbit Seasoning ( 1952 ) , and Duck Hunt ( 1953 ) . It is said that each of those movies are the most memorable. To say they're not is simply to make an assumption: They are all great, even if it is difficult to understand their unique qualities. It is not true that I would have been able to watch this movie in the theater if it had been released for my friends and relatives. What makes it so different from any other movie?|0
This was on odd film . I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. I got a copy of this movie which is very disappointing, I've been trying to enjoy it and I would not have made this movie without knowing it.The only thing I don't like about it is that it was so badly done. What you get is a mediocre movie with horrible effects and some poor script and director who isn't really good at producing. The most irritating thing is the ending. There is nothing to make this movie end any quicker.|0
Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential.|1
Well.....I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVD's yet). Boy....was I surprised!!|1
I have watched this show from the beginning, and I am a 45 year old man. To me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family.|1
I 'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film . If you don't want to read any more than a few paragraphs into it then you're wasting my time. I would give it 3 stars, if only for the way in which they gave it a rating that's very low. The movie was great, well written. It is an action thriller with good plot twists and lots of suspense. The first four hours of the movie are boring. The characters are not believable at all.|0
I LOVE this movie. and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where I can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. All these Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring.|1
In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them.|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew , a narrative depth superior to most novels , wonderful music, and some fantastic acting in this film . There was a problem with this review. There is really no point in going into what the movie did, because it is far from the story you expected. However, I have seen more than half a million of the films that are made here (as well as many others). It is not a great film, at least in terms of visuals, cinematography, script, or choreography.The characters are all very bland and flat.|0
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was alright, the only problem was Moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. Haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. Though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE.|1
Fata Morgana is , by far , one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I was very surprised when it came out a few years ago and thought nothing of it. But that's not to say that I am wrong. You might also think so but there were two parts in here which I must admit did not make much sense as I've seen them before (that, and this film doesn't seem to be good).The story starts off with someone getting kidnapped by terrorists and they decide to kill all the hostages.|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes of the characters, but does it really have any real character? And what is worse that they all know nothing about America?I've watched most of these movies on repeat, and haven't seen a bad one. If only I saw one more, would I feel good about it?This movie is far from terrible; if only it made it into a TV show, or even a movie, I wouldn't be surprised.|0
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds or so.So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content.|1
"I too saw this movie when it first came out . I was a teenager at the time , and I thought I knew what was wrong with it . It didn't sound good, but I could tell by its tone that there are a lot of great characters. The acting is not especially good enough to be considered as an original story in many ways, so let's avoid that.What really bothered me was how much the plot progressed throughout the book. A lot of the stuff you find on the internet is pure fantasy-ism, even if it doesn't fall into the ""good guys are bad boys"" category."|0
comeundone , I love you ! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this. The game is good, but it didn't really stand out as anything special when compared to previous ones in this genre. There's not much action, or story, but the main character isn't very believable at all. The animation is slow and flat, and nothing interesting comes from it either. All of my time on this subject has been spent on characters that look more like humanoids than real creatures.|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare , and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling . It 's not exactly what you're hoping for, with this movie from the 1970s getting better as I watched it. This movie has been shown before, but never by me in person so I can't really explain its story. However, I think the acting is alright.The soundtrack is good and if you haven't heard, listen closely to the soundtrack and you'll find out what makes the whole thing tick.This movie was a bit disappointing at times.|0
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted ""naturally"" and you ""felt"" for them in the respective roles. A ""glossy"" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January, 2005."|1
It 's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it looks like the real thing is a complete joke. On the other hand, it seems as though the plot is very clever (at least if you don't understand anything about how Hollywood works). A great movie. Very nice acting. I loved this movie so much that I couldn't sleep. This film wasn't particularly good enough to get my head through. The acting was poor and the dialogue was lacking.|0
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). However, the principal acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress ""Nefer""."|1
If there's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other, It's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. Besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by Marvin Miller, pretty much everything. And it won the Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1950. Glad to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how awesome!|1
honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can't ever get enough Gilmore!|1
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious Camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians.|1
Forget about the plot of this movie . Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn. Why? Because it was shot in New York City instead of Los Angeles. As I've seen many reviews and comments over the years, I tend to think that this film should be considered a classic, but if you are not into that sort of thing, this film will take you off course. This is one of those movies that could be considered one of the best films of the last 15-25 years.|0
`` L'Auberge Espagnole '' collected the audience wherever it was shown . It gathered audience awards on many film festivals around the world. And for some reason, it still doesn't get nominated for best acting. I must say I am very excited to find out about this film! In a short period of time I had not seen it and when I did I couldn't figure out what it actually was. After having read all those reviews people immediately pointed out that this movie was garbage. But I felt bad for someone who tried to put their hopes and dreams into a movie by making fun of the human race.|0
When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot.|1
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised).|1
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002, ""l'auberge espagnole"" was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. This movie made by one of the most interesting French film-makers of these last years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students coming from all over Europe and gathered all together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life: either untidy, either serious or with a sense of humor."|1
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their ""Erasmus year"" in Barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal location. The idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about the countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries.Having experienced ""Erasmus"" on myself during my exchang semester in Italy I can say that is movie is incredibly authentic."|1
i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store back home. ive seen several movies with this type of quality before, and as you can see in the picture I wasn't much impressed...but i guess there was a bit of trouble. A must see to watch at the moment - this is one of my top recommendations. You will enjoy the story but have to pay attention to some interesting characters who often seem to be just about on the verge of going insane.|0
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain ( of course , because it 's so sensationalistic ). I had seen a movie called The Big Bang Theory, but never saw it, so I guess I'm not saying it's all that great. It has an awful premise, one of which is that if you're interested in the origins of life, you are going to have to go back to prehistoric times or something. If you've seen the first half of Jurassic Park, and you're curious about what happens in the sequel, then this will be an absolutely must-buy.|0
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of ""Rawhide"" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out."|1
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau.|1
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band 's 30 year career . Lee , the bassist/vocalist, was so good that I couldn't stop playing him for a few minutes. As for the soundtrack to this song, it's really nothing like anything you've heard before or seen before. My husband and I both love the sound of this film. You can't really tell what's out there when you're sitting on a couch in a movie theater watching it. That said, sometimes I get bored (even if it's just to enjoy myself while watching).|0
Usually , Alan Alda plays characters that are too `` soft '' and overly verbal -- it 's probably how he portrayed them, so we don't actually have to bother with them anyway. This isn't much of a story in my opinion. First off, let me get this straight: there was no real reason to read this book out of respect for the authors or the film's character. If anything, this novel does not deserve any kind of praise from critics. It should have been directed more seriously than this, as it shows some of the basic qualities of an excellent horror movie.|0
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys , but providing a little more information that we didn't expect. It also makes some sense, considering how much of what is available on the internet about African-Americans is based largely off stereotypes. I personally feel sorry for them and I hope they're able to learn from their mistakes. If you are in NYC, it's probably because you know all too well that Black America has been a melting pot for decades. What would you like to see changed?|0
This movie is VERY LONG, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you are a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) My mother is a Civil War buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off TV), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance.|1
This comment discusses `` North and South Book I '' dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA as it appears in U.S. history is quite interesting considering the American people have been making up their minds on it for almost 2½ decades now. In this film we are presented with an attempt to make sense of what really happened between the events in 1842-1861. We are given a first impression that the United States has become divided over issues relating to race and religion. But there is something deeply disturbing going on here.|0
'The Cell ' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally . The story starts with him going to a bar where there are 20,000 people drinking from a bottle and stabbing each other. He goes back to see if he can get away with it and when he finds that he has some money on him, he gets in touch with a local man who is a part of the family. He offers to take care of them for him but he refuses due to his fear of what might happen if he ever found out that they have been killed.|0
"`` The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends , '' says Marion Fairlie , who with her husband is one of the best-looking kids in town. Movies, TV and movies all have their faults but if you're trying to be objective about what a movie has to offer, you should do your homework first. ""I don't mean that this movie is good"" is a good way to put it, but if you've got anything else going for yourself, look at how poorly made it was when there's only one decent film on the slate."|0
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. The gangsters, (led by Bryan Brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. That's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. But this mob tickle your funny bone as well. A clever structured script by Jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.|1
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie."|1
This was an excellent show. It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teen aged daughter. The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. IT was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember several episodes but the one I remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I was able to keep up with the program.|1
"I 'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of view I would like them to make. The problem was that they didn't understand the basic premise of this game. First, if you ask any of the reviewers what is meant by ""good"" these people are going to say ""This game is bad"". Second, as an aside, there are several reviews (aside from the one in which I can't remember a single one) who said they had never seen an action film in their entire life."|0
King of Queens is comic genius. Kevin James, whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife Carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. The true magic of the show However is the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, whom lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, 2006.|1
I could n't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character . I laughed for days just sitting there on my couch watching them. This show is a huge hit and I will never watch another of its shows without it. I was going through puberty when I found this series. This is an absolute horror show about a young lady who goes into hiding in her hometown to save her family. The story is extremely suspenseful (no spoilers). There are a few plot twists that don't work, and it gets very dark as a result.|0
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art of War-themed games. The story goes along this way giving the audience some information about the events that took place over the last few years, so you can feel free to dig deeper into the film. It does give us a peek behind the curtain but is very short on plot. It is hard to put into words just how bad and boring this film really is. While it is a fairly small movie, I do not believe anyone would recommend it to others.|0
"""Two Hands"" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity."|1
It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. You'll probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place.|1
I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went back many more times to see it over and over ... I think 9 times in all. Just great is how I would describe it ... I was taken by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the life style the kids began on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had set up ... of course the powers that be have to intercede, but when I forget that part I find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that!|1
I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old , ( having an existing interest in cinema as a kid). I can remember thinking it would be boring. But even so, I'm not a huge movie nerd. I just enjoy watching films where there's a sense of horror lurking around the edges. And that sense of horror pervades my life . The plot? Well, it's not very well conceived or believable. However, it does look good and feel really good at times.|0
I 'm absolutely disgusted this movie is n't being sold . All who love this movie should email Disney and ask that they do something. It is a poor attempt to show off the best part of The Princess Diaries, which in the end is worse than the most pathetic thing you've seen before. Came home at 6 am with my friend for the second time. We're not really sure what's wrong, but it felt like I had just walked out of a theater. Apparently there were people dancing on the sidewalk outside the store (I think).|0
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network T.V. I think I was like 9. (Picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remembered,it's really good,scary flick. I think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a ****load of sequels i.e. Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better.|1
"The first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we actually enjoyed it very much, although we were left wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one, leaving us guessing...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its original integral version."|1
Yes , this is one of the better done television movies and I would n't expect less from Joe Sargent. He was a genius at creating something that didn't make it. The acting was just not what it needed to be . But then, once you watch this, you will feel sorry for him because he doesn't really put his talents where his. This is another one of those movies where the characters get caught up in some bad reality.It is hard to imagine a more enjoyable TV show than these two films. I have been watching all three movies and they all sound so good.|0
When this film gets it right it really gets it right . And when it goes wrong ... I 'd go to see it for myself. It is a long way from being one of the greatest horror films ever made (I watched it because I wasn't as good in school as I was in the 70's), but there are moments that you just can't seem to forget. The story centers around a couple who live in a rental house, and they start to lose their home and get trapped in an underground apartment.|0
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall ! As an archivist I decided that it wasn't necessary. Some of you may have seen my youtube videos on this, but I don't care! You can find a list of music that I've performed at other shows in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Here are some of my favorites from these cities (I haven't been to all of them yet):
I'm afraid this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how this film compares to other contemporary productions."|0
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V . and came across this guy standing in front of me. I think it was about 5 or 6 feet down at the end of a hill with a little rock in the top. He was wearing a white shirt and his hair was longer than any he had appeared in, so that may have been the reason he didn't come up to me (he didn't). The guy kept asking questions and I told him to look away.|0
"A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film : Who are the crazy people ? The answer become less and less likely with each passing day, but I could not bear to write another word on it until I got there.The script has been adapted into five movies, one that was very well received by the American Film Institute. That said , it may have been better made by a British producer as the script was too dark and dull. If you love your movie, then you should watch ""The BFG."" This must be one of cinema's most interesting pieces of writing."|0
At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late.|1
... I saw this movie when it first came out in France , in my hometown , 54 years ago. The characters are interesting, they are interesting, but not like the other films of the era. One has to imagine that if you were a big screen writer, and wanted to write more than a couple dozen movies every month, there would be some sort of plot hole at least . It would be almost too boring to do any kind of writing. So, I decided to try something new. This is one of those movies I never did see.|0
"""The Cell"" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, ""a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim"", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing."|1
Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. For those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--How often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? It is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part they succeed wonderfully.|1
I liked this a lot . The camera angles are cool , it 's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch movie, but I loved the cinematography. If you have never seen Blair Witch before or haven't yet seen the movie then I highly recommend checking it out as there is a LOT of interesting stuff coming your way! My friends and I were visiting our local bookstore (where we buy books), and found a book about witches that we'd never seen before. A woman was very friendly and kindly asked me to put her in her place.|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.'|1
Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits. The entire plot, however, revolves around the idea that Bugs has to get out of this situation by himself. It feels like there's a real conflict within the group between good guys and bad guys who want to protect each other. If you don't like it (and don't care about how many people you can kill), you should definitely go read this comic instead. But what are you doing at the expense of someone who enjoys watching those characters struggle to find their footing?|0
Brilliant film ! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats not a bad thing in itself. You could have put a little more effort in making it look like Pulp Fiction when the movie started, and this would be a much more accurate representation of what they're trying to achieve with it.This is about an old woman who wants to see her life back. But as time goes on, she realizes that no matter what she finds, things will not always go right for her friends or her family.|0
"""Americans Next Top Model"" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.I kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, I did blink) It can be sad, funny, or addicting. (mostly addicting)""America's Next Top Model"" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series!"|1
"does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this . I have never seen it before and so far as i'm sure it was not one of my favorite movies ever. I had no idea what this was, but after listening to all the talk about bad movies you should really go watch this one. The only movie i can think of that would be better is ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". If you don't want to watch this crap, start a youtube channel and watch it."|0
Our America is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the U.S. all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens.|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have.|1
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, ""Rabbit Seasoning"" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqué for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did."|1
"This movie is Wonderful ! I can watch it again and again . Robin hood is Perfectly cast , and the actors were so well made that you didn't really see their faces in the film. It's about an adult woman who gets caught up in a conspiracy to overthrow the queen of France (who's actually a young woman) and she decides to take her son on a train to London. The girl travels all around the country with no regard for what happens to her son.The main characters are just average kids who are being forced by the authorities to become ""badasses"" during the day."|0
It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of `` slasher '' movies in the early 1980 's , there would be fewer films like it, but this particular one was just downright awful to watch, and I'd say the only redeeming feature was the lack of an adaptation of the film. It is actually not so bad at all when you watch the first three minutes of the movie, although a little late on the DVD release. There's no good or bad here, and if you are looking for new horror movies, then you aren't going to want to miss out.|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn ` t get to see the original teleplay untill a few weeks back. It was a good deal of content and an entertaining story, but it lacked suspense. There is a scene that plays out pretty much exactly how it would've been done: a man falls from a high cliff. In fact, it could've been better. What follows is an extremely crude depiction of what might have been in the beginning of this story. Even after a few scenes, the movie doesn't tell the entire story.|0
Sure , it has its pretentious moments , it plays like art-house , live-action Fantasia , but it also has a very bad acting . I can't say enough good things about this story, for example because it is poorly directed and the cinematography is atrocious. However, this could have been even worse if we hadn't done this! Well, here's the deal. I would recommend this to everyone who enjoys fantasy novels. The plot isn't perfect. It tries too hard to make you believe everything you hear and see.|0
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries , I did n't expect much from 'Two Weeks in Heaven'. The acting doesn't stand out at all and there isn't anything memorable going on either. What the film is worth to a movie writer, I have no doubt it would have earned a better score than this one if it hadn't been given an additional 9 stars.The acting is also quite bland. There are a number of odd scenes that only seem to be related to one scene but most of them are completely cut-out.|0
Finally a true horror movie . This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes as I was writing this piece. I didn't know what to do, I just thought that it would make for a pretty bad review. I couldn't wait to watch the rest of the movie and get out of here before I even saw it. If you really want to know how creepy this movie is, you're going to see it at least three times per day. This was one of the most fun things on Netflix.|0
"The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar (""The Saint"") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as ""Pearly"" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool!"|1
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address ""Mithi/Mithali"" (Konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. ""Prof.Anu"" (Shabhana Azmi)is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from Mithi's mom's earlier marriage. The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through her continuous blabbering to Anu and others. Konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which I am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of Mithi in this movie."|1
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to put it down. In a world where movies tend to be good, they are not good films at all. The animation is bad as well. I've never seen a movie that managed to be so cartoonish in its look and feel. This was one of the few times I didn't think it was possible for the creators of this project to make a show that wouldn't be too cartoonish and still be able to attract more viewers.|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say ""french culture"". I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) My french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!"|1
This movie is Wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin hood is Perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is the funniest character, along with Latrine and the Sheriff! While space balls got boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great film, and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles, and it is spoofed perfectly, and makes so much sense, and can be watched again and again!|1
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'Wagon Master' made after two big Indian-cavalry epics... It is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... It didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...Photographically, it is extremely simple... The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons...|1
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim ( Richard Barthelmess ) who has one bad flight in front of him. There is no explanation for this bad flight because Jim doesn't even know that he is flying. In fact, he was only half joking when he said it would make him less funny. That's just what happened. I don't watch TV too often but I love to watch films with my friends or kids and they seem to like them. My boyfriend and I decided to give this movie a try and started watching about 10 minutes ago.|0
there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie.|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about . Or , maybe he just had a good time as an actor but this was no longer the case. If you watched this movie before, you know exactly what I'm talking about; it's one of the worst movies made by any director in the entire '60s and beyond. After watching this movie for the first time I was quite surprised to see the lack of drama on display in that movie (or in the movie itself).|0
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob.|1
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film . To have it read as though it was made on a computer screen and then see some of the other parts you'll be left wondering what the hell you're watching. That's where the real trouble starts, because the film actually has a lot going for it. The acting is poor at best and not very memorable. The plot isn't particularly good and the action is poorly written. I don't think that really matters because the characters are so predictable and the plot is pretty straight-forward.|0
`` The Cell '' is an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a scientist but its subject. There is absolutely nothing on this movie which will please me. All you can think about are the bad guys and the weirdness of people acting as if it was some sort of fantasy story. I've been disappointed by both of these films and will have to watch another film to get better at this one. It is simply ridiculous that so many great movies were made without any concept of anything remotely resembling science or human nature.This film is a joke.|0
"I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie . But at the earnest request of a friend , I found myself wondering if I might be wrong on that matter. It was, as always, about me. I have no doubt that the premise of this film is fantastic. However, when I read reviews for it and watched the film (at least one said ""well worth watching"" because it had an excellent screenplay), I began to think there could be more good films in this series."|0
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script , good camera work and transitions , good directing, good performances and a good acting. The book is very short, so that's not a problem.The story is fairly simple, and you really have to be smart to get it to end. There is one scene where someone (played by a different actor than the one who was playing) falls out of their chair and gets hurt. The scene has been shown many times on TV , but only recently became a movie.|0
Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years . Great production design , appealing stars , and good actors all together. This is another one of those horror films which should have been made into a TV show. The only problem is that the movie ends up with too much gore, not because there was any gore, but because most of them were created by the writers rather than the filmmakers. But the script is terrible (I guess I could say better), and it just doesn't feel like anything that you've ever seen before.The best parts of this film were the dialogue.|0
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role as Williams for that entire show, was Emmy worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is....WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes.|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and it's among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison.|1
Whoever cast this movie was a genius , every character in it is perfect for their part , and they do a good job putting together the best performances I've seen in a while ! This is the worst movie I've ever seen on DVD or Blu-ray. At least I can say there isn't one scene of it that actually happened. The film is so well thought out that I wasn't surprised to watch it even though I had not been watching anything else on the same day. However, I did see this movie once and then never saw it again.|0
This movie has a lot to recommend it. The paintings, the music, and David Hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*.|1
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that 's been released lately . It was funny , and well acted , but I had to admit it was not a great movie. So here we are again in 2007, just a little over a year since I started posting on this site. Today I'm going to give you some insight into all of the things that led me to writing this review.The story is really interesting. A few weeks after getting back from another trip, I fell asleep at home with a friend and his baby.|0
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. I think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.There are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than USA T.M., I'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't.|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What's happening in South Africa should guide us all.|1
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It ranks right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. Today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances.|1
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield. The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named Brian Foster whose systems at his boss's company seems to keep failing, Brian is also dating the boss's daughter named Casey. But Brian secretly invented a robotic dog named CHOMPS, modeled after his own dog Rascal. But CHOMPS is no ordinarily dog, he is as fast as a cheetah, he has x-ray vision, can leap about 6 feet, and has a strength of 20 men. The new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success.|1
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to motherless in a car that she could not afford to drive, I knew my wife was about to cry out for the world to stop acting like some kind of idiot. Now it is too late! The film begins and ends without any redeeming qualities. This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched and yet I was so glad when I first saw it. It just seemed like a dumb joke.|0
I played Sam ( the porter , Lou 's sidekick ) in the Film `` Dead Rail '' Which later became my favorite film, and it's not hard to understand why this was considered a good movie. One thing I'll say is you should probably watch it twice, once on DVD, and once on Blu-ray, for sure. The only reason I bought it so that I could buy some more copies of it when it went into print is because I never thought they would make a good film. This is by far the funniest script I have ever seen .|0
I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track will be released, Ilona Sekacz' work is truly enduring. Twenty years on I am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. Somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction? ), Catherine descends on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney.|1
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ! I was not a huge fan of the movie at all and I just felt that there was nothing to like about it. I saw this movie in theaters, I think it was only 5 minutes long . It did not have very much going for it though; it didn't show off the characters or any of the great acting (it was really funny) which makes it even worse when you look at the scene itself.The film is poorly written as it's mainly focused on making fun of women and their ""perversions."""|0
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes ( with the exception of the first 2), which I didn't think I could get enough of. The main character isn't very interesting as he's still trying to decide if he wants to live in the future, but there is no denying that his past life has something to do with it:
What can be said about the rest of the plot and characters? One thing we've learned from this movie is that they all end up hating each other."|0
"This movie makes you think . It shows how a woman 's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others . I thought the characters were more interesting than they were , so let me just mention them. In this case, she is portrayed by Diane Keaton and it is a shame she wasn't better. I really need to watch another movie like this that tells us about the power of sex and sexual frustration. This movie makes you think . ""What are you going to do?! Do you love watching people die? Or do we have an excuse why we don't?"|0
Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made , `` Murder in the Music Hall '' seems to have undeservably low budget. As an adult, this is a very bad movie. In fact, the worst I've seen has been of one of the most awful directors ever. Not even the best director can produce such a horrendous movie: Robert De Niro was there to direct it. He had his head stuck on the chair like that for thirty years, so he couldn't move his mouth around. The screenplay was just too much.|0
"The Killing Yard is a great film, although uneven at times. Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's ""flashback"" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. I was not even born when the Attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, I find that ""The Killing Yard"" does the story all of it's fair justices."|1
Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, while is does have elements of documentation of it's images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all taking place in the Sahara desert.|1
My kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with.|1
"Every time I hear Karen Carpenter 's voice , there is that old familiar feeling of 70 's blues . You know what? This was one of the finest songs ever made by anyone who could remember it. The rest of her lyrics, along with ""I Don't Know Why They Do This"" and ""Let Me See You Now"" are a complete throwback to the early 90's. This film is so damn good you should probably listen to it now. I can't believe how awful it is. There isn't really anything interesting about this movie other than the story, characters, and plot."|0
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west. John Ford's stock of character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent James Arness, a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train.|1
"Brian ( Wesley Eure ) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton ( Conrad Bain ) . The movie is not good, at least in the trailer, but I found it interesting enough that I've had to see it. It doesn't seem like this film should ever have been made and if you're watching it, don't worry -- it's a pretty bad thing. This is one of those movies where you don't get much more than ""Oh, wait, this is what happens when you make a movie!"""|0
The philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. I'd give it 10 stars for that alone. That being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what I take, possibly incorrectly, to be its Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated Munsell Color Model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself.|1
"A classic late 50 's film . The superannuated headliners ( Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan ) are not at all the ""real men"" in the movie. But what does they have to do with the rest of the cast, who are just as dumbfounded? There is nothing particularly wrong with that, but it feels like a waste of time. There's so much nonsense about how these two women were supposed to be on the set, that one would expect their names to be printed on some kind of black background."|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren't any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question.|1
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much . This is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. If you haven't seen it yet, here are some reviews. First, a few things to keep in mind before watching:1) This is a short film that doesn't really even take itself seriously. The plot starts out very low level and gets very convoluted. As you can see, this movie is not about anything at all. It is about an orphan boy who goes on a terrible trip to Africa.|0
After `` Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman '' with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just about as attractive as men, it didn't make much sense. When you look back over the years and see how women were treated at the time, I think they should have been treated even worse. I don't know where else I could have looked at the movie and said to myself why did it take so long? The only person who would have told us was Kathy Griffin. How many people in the world can believe that Kathy Griffin has somehow become the face of America?|0
"The ""Hunting Trilogy"" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the ""greatest"" or ""most important"" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made."|1
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. I still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. Like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. The best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change.|1
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD. Yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian, culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh?|1
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord!|1
I Love this movie ! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie , but when you see it in the movie theatre you know something is wrong. There is actually no scene or idea in the film, and there are so many things going on. The only thing that jumps out here is that it looks very different than anything I have seen before. It's very boring and uninteresting to watch, and as for my enjoyment of this flick, I really can't wait to do it again! This movie came across like a hit at the beginning of last year .|0
"Although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...I just HAD to live in New York. It has great opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis crooning ""Romance is still...the best of everything..."" that rival those of West Side Story. There is a rather stilted performance by the world's REAL first Supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry about that, Janice D.), but it's great eye-candy!"|1
"An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export ! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in the dark, with no clear camera angles or sound, it is very easy to guess why. The story is so simple that you cannot imagine how complex the whole thing would have gotten had it not been for the great acting of Paul Revere, one of the more powerful directors in the history of Hollywood. My favorite movie of 2005, ""Miles to Mars"". This was released just two years prior to the start of the Vietnam War (1921-22)."|0
"I saw the Messiah : - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have seen in recent history. This is an excellent documentary about what it meant to be a 'hero'. I just cannot put this film down, but I don't think there is any other programme worth watching. It is very hard not to think that the story of this movie can be told for two minutes long if you know where you are going with the plot.The only thing left to do is ask ""What's the joke?"""|0
`` Boy Next Door '' is a hilarious romp through male neurosis . In just over fifteen minutes , the film does not go down well. One of the actors has to tell us that he's been on drugs all his life, and will probably be out for a long time, but he manages to keep in good spirits even after being forced to watch this dreadful horror movie. If you want to have a laugh at this terrible film, I highly recommend watching 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' on DVD only. This is one of my very favorite movies ever made.|0
I must say it was a let down . Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled herself in this new series, but i'm hoping she can improve on things she has done and keep going. The plot is interesting and well done - not all the time, which i think will be a problem with this show. I guess you could go ahead and watch one of the first two, or at least try and watch them again for free. I am disappointed that some people don't understand what my experience with this show is.|0
First love . Teenage love . We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the first two or three movies. This movie is one of those movies that doesn't work in the slightest. So many good movies in this series, I couldn't possibly be more disappointed.This movie will definitely be worth the money you spend to watch it...you are probably going to have to give a second chance for the DVD. If you're going to waste your money on anything else then this is the way to go.|0
* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it.I don't know if I'd call this one a good idea, or if they made some sort of plot out of it. Well, there you go! This is what my first experience with anime was with The Simpsons. It was very well done and all the plot was just plain wrong.The animation was terrible. They were too slow for my taste at all. It was almost as if every episode was about a girl getting raped and then trying to escape her tormentor.|0
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V. and came across this film. I don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well, my meeting was pushed back, because I couldn't get out of this film. It had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it.|1
Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent.|1
If you want to see a movie with nudity , sex , drugs , alcohol , brutal beating of a young woman. If you want to understand the power dynamics that drive women to commit crimes and murder people because they feel they deserve to get raped - then you don't really need to spend much time there. It's almost impossible to figure out what the film in question is based on without spoilers. I was very confused at first. After reading the script, I immediately went into a panic when I saw some of the trailers.|0
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?The answer become less clear as the film goes on.Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.Chris Rock  though as foul-mouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as Wesley.|1
"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience.It is interesting how the film balances the message that ""one should not generalize"" with the notion that ""for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth"". For example, the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well-known Italian stereotype."|1
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just a joke, and I am sure that she would rather die than be with her boyfriend.But now she is back in Britain and I have no idea what happened... I didn't realise that you were watching the German version! This movie has all of the same features as this one, except it has a bit more nudity (for some reason we can never see anyone at all).The main character is pretty much always dressed very feminine.|0
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition.|1
If I 'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty , I probably would n't have touched it with a stick. What a waste of time! In fact, this is the worst example I ever saw of that film. The script is so poor, all of the characters look awful, they don't speak or act like the people at the screening were even there. It just doesn't add up to a positive performance. I've been in this movie long enough to hear some horrible things about it, and I think you should too.|0
This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks . Marjorie Main ( Ma ) steals the show with her melodramatic monologues, while the rest of the audience is on the couch waiting for a performance. I don't know how much longer they have to wait! The opening sequence is so good that you can tell it's all about two men who love each other and spend the next four hours staring at eachother. It's easy to forget what happened in the previous scene, especially with the three main characters, who are looking at one another and having sex.|0
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it.Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it.|1
"honestly .. this show warms my heart , i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new year starts i'm wondering what is this show doing in terms of getting away with all those horrible comments? This show gets me excited to see what would happen if they had actually taken care of our kids or their parents?? Oh, wait. There's not much to say about ""The Simpsons,"" but I know some of you might think there's an easy answer to this one. That was never supposed to be true!"|0
See No Evil With Kane. The Movie Has a great storyline But it just wasn't a Hide my eye's, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it was going to be from watching the WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw When The Movie First Came To Theaters. I Did ENJOY The Movie Though I Loved The Story It Played Out.GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 It Doesn't Matter If Kane Gets Killed At The EndOr Not They Have Killed Off Other Horror Stars In Every Movie They Have Out And They Still Comeback For More So a part 2 wouldBe Very Interesting.|1
Well , okay , maybe not perfect , but it was pretty close . This movie jumped from crime drama to horror, and has had an effect on many people at the beginning. But once I got used to seeing it for itself , I ended up watching this movie in my 30s. This movie is probably one of the best shows I have ever seen. I saw it as a kid when I was just 3-5 years old. There are really nothing wrong with a 15-20 minute episode, but the plot isn't original.|0
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I expected. Instead the director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until I was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave it a very Deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory.|1
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty , easily one of the most charming , off-beat , and lighthearted comedies I've seen in a long time: a very good sitcom, with excellent writing, great acting, amazing acting. I hate to be honest here, but I would like to know who is the funniest person on this show. What's worse is that I don't believe anybody is funny enough to make it out alive. I didn't have a lot of film knowledge when I was watching this so I wasn't trying to tell you guys what to do.|0
Wow! An amazing, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. This film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. As a retelling of the Oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. The chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This film used to be double featured with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is.|1
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak.|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie . How surprised I was ! This is a great story, it's a classic. The actors were all beautiful, but there was something about their faces that made us believe that they could not be serious characters. It wasn't because they were funny, just because you can't help but feel as if you've watched someone else's film with your camera. This movie looks like it was filmed from the 1950s or '60s and it isn't anything of interest to those who live in the 60s and 80s.|0
Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party.|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways . It is a non stop plethora of emotion and plotlines but it is really not worth the effort. If you like drama and comedy then this film is just fine. But for me, its boring and I don't think anyone will care to watch it. I read some reviews about this movie on my web site and thought it would be better if I found them elsewhere. Now I cannot believe I am writing this review. I couldn't resist doing what I was doing when I was a kid.|0
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son  Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson, his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.|1
I 'm not gon na lie . To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is coming up, and I didn't really see it for about a month. It is so hard to tell whether someone actually has an idea what is happening inside the house they're sitting in, but I am sure that's why you'd hear it.It's not as entertaining as it claims to be, because of how easy it is to fall asleep on your couch and suddenly wake up into something resembling real life.|0
"I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover, and the centerfold, as I recall. She's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and so I kept a look out for her in other stuff. She's in Steven Spielberg's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and Barbara Streisand's ""The Main Event"" and Bill Murray's ""Meatballs"", plus lots of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies."|1
"I'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) The sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. It's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's ""running the show,"" so I'm glad the movie doesn't try."|1
This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. It is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship.|1
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. The thing is South Park makes fun of everybody, much like the Simpsons did. If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious, Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing.|1
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than the first two movies. The script is a little dated but what's worse is that it was written so poorly that most of the plot points were lost in the process, which makes the whole thing all the worse. This movie is nothing special but just plain silly. The premise is as follows: In order to stop a vampire from attacking an unsuspecting couple, the woman must protect their precious daughter from the evil spirit who has killed her husband.|0
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am. My brother and I were channel surfing and who do we see but a young Russel Crowe. But not the telephone throwing Russel Crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. It stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to come across this film I would strongly suggest picking it up.|1
I'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. All who love this movie should email Disney and increase the demand for it. They'd eventually have to sell it then. I'd buy copies for everybody I know. Everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and I haven't figured out why Disney hasn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. The kids in the new generation don't get to see it and I think they should.|1
"This is how I interpreted the movie : First things first . There was not a single scene in the entire movie that didn't involve torture or sex. Second , I saw it from an angle that made me feel bad, like this movie was something I would watch more than once. In fact , there were a couple of great scenes that really stuck out in my heart. You know what you're thinking : ""What a dumb movie! I'll never think twice about watching such a film again!"" I watched this one before I got married and have been watching it for 10 years now."|0
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts , unlike many other great Ford films , like the one directed by Roger Corman that didn't have any emotion, and certainly did not end well. I don't see how I am going to keep watching this film on DVD until it finds its way into my hands. I'm not sure why, but it's been around forever for a couple of months now and I just love it. I've been watching all three versions since it was released, so I must be trying to find something that doesn't suck.|0
"As I was reading through the comments , I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was supposed to be good. The actors were bad and in a good position to direct, and they had nothing else going for them except their performance.I'm sure it's because of all the horrible acting, but there wasn't any special effects or some pretty dramatic scenes. If you're a fan of ""Pulp Fiction"", then this movie should have been your choice.There were many plot twists, which only made things more confusing."|0
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like ""he's faking"". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody."|1
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years . As a boy , I was excited to see all those cute and adorable animals that looked like them. It took me a bit longer to figure out how this could possibly have worked. But here's the part where I think we all would've liked more:
I knew I needed to make one, but what if I could only make a few? Well, I thought it would be too good a time to go back in time to see such a stunning photo of a bird."|0
Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a wonderful central performance from Renée Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fiancé and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him.Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless.|1
North and South is a miniseries from the `` golden age '' of television miniseries in the 1980s , which was cancelled at the end of 1989 . The series was originally scheduled to be aired in early 1990, but as of 1994 has been sold out. One day this week, I went to the local movie shop where I bought some popcorn for my grandson's Halloween party. As I opened the box, there was something wrong with the popcorn. They had never given me a good explanation of what it was that was wrong with it.|0
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear in. Three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer from ""For A Few Dollars More,"" and the third is garbed like Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins."|1
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good:The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully.It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined.David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done any better.The Bad:There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old ( I hold a different belief). Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.|1
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture , 'Wagon Master ' made after two big Indian-cavalry losses in India.It is also interesting to note that we cannot tell where the films are from. I think this film should be called 'Piggyback'. The original script has been updated with some new dialogue. It may even have been directed by Raghub Bhattacharya.The story takes place in 1947 during an Indian uprising in New York City. A group of Indians, led by Vadip Khera, set out on a mission to reclaim the British East India Company.|0
"I loved this movie! OH MY GOSH! This movie rocked so hard! I found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (Which btw, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about. ), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. ""What controversy?"""|1
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the first place. There was nothing wrong with it at all - it made a decent movie. However, this is an example of a bad movie which needs to be addressed as soon as possible due to lack of dialogue or acting. It is quite easy to understand that the script is written and acted on by David Caine. I have watched almost all of his films but this is not one of them. There isn't any real sense of humor in the screenplay either.|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.This is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. The acting and directing are very powerful.2. Beautifully shot.|1
"I did n't personally know Karen Carpenter , nor , Richard for that matter , so I must go by them all.It's like the movie ""Gravity"" made it to its climax. There are some nice moments and a few bad moments but it just feels like an awful film, a waste of screen time and an excuse for wasting all the time I spent on the movie.This is not the first time I've heard of Gravity movies and I am not even going to compare my own experience to the ones they made."|0
"I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances . I just read a user comment concerning this film stating: ""You really don't understand why you are watching this video! I know it sounds stupid, but if you're going to watch this movie you must understand some basic language. You have no idea what you've been waiting for!"" What they were trying to accomplish was get people to buy into these characters by making them feel bad about how they did things. If you are not one of those people, there is no need to watch this movie."|0
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow . We do n't usually warm up to a series or movie before it gets boring but we can never have the sense of dread, wonder if it will change. And then there's this scene in particular:
""Oh, my god! What is this!? Oh my god! What is this happening?!"" The whole sequence was so over-the-top that I couldn't pick it up at all. ""Hey, how'd you get here? No one's here! No one's leaving!"|0
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be in and I believe it has done well and held up over time. Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd.It may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment.|1
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film . It is an excellent entry point into what might have been the last decade or so of his career. I am a big fan of the characters and story, but there are lots of other aspects about the character that make it difficult for me to believe him. One of the main reasons I wanted to see this was that he has had some serious problems in the past with his mother. The only thing that I can agree with is the fact that this film should have been watched on DVD.|0
this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for Gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love Sookie St. James!|1
"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, passé way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack."|1
"`` The Honkers '' is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time . When we were shooting , everyone was saying it would make a better movie or worse than what we're doing right now ! ""I don't think you can say the same about this movie ! It has some elements that are just beyond comprehension. I guess I'll leave it to you to judge the director's intentions, and his lack of attention to detail when making this movie should have been apparent to me. But I'm going to leave it with you to judge the film on its artistic merits."|0
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did). I'm European and I've studied abroad and I've as good as lived with Spanish, french, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews I see that it did p*** people off. But, this film gets the stereotypes so right I cannot fault it.|1
Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big!|1
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen . To explain my experience , let me start by saying that it is hard not to like this movie, but I really didn't enjoy it as much as I did the first time I saw it. I was a fan of the original series and watched it with such fondness that I found myself wanting to re-watch it again. The pacing is slow, which is odd considering the last two episodes are almost totally devoted to characters that weren't supposed to be around at all.|0
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world. I think I would have been much happier with an hour-and-a-half longer than this one, but it isn't. But it does take a lot of effort to be funny. Even though it is not really that funny at all (it just looks like someone gave up trying to teach a movie). It could have been even funnier if it was about a family with four grown-ups; or maybe it should have lasted two minutes longer.|0
If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie.|1
"Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm , wit , and charm . At age 16 Lorelai López was born and raised in the Philippines. She has always loved acting and had been interested in acting since childhood. After spending several years as a part actress she found that acting was very difficult even though she liked to say ""I like to act"", but now she can't think of a better job than directing her own film. It is very disappointing that Lorelai will not be returning for another year. Lorenax is so well done."|0
There are a few things in life that we ca n't experience more than once and the college experience is one of these. A few years ago, I had the misfortune of being kicked out of my home by an older boyfriend because he wanted to marry me. I made a couple of attempts at making this movie but they all turned out to be pointless. Now I'm back with some great original work which is also worth a watch if you're looking for something interesting to do on your couch. What's next? Well here it is.|0
"In dramatising Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route."|1
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I didn't have great taste back then (not to say that I do now) so I can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, worth watching. I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash.|1
I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it! !If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.|1
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships , 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the kids, they will be able to follow in their father's footsteps (and not just his) when he has been killed off. It's an entertaining story, and while I have seen most of the original film in my time at this location, I do not think any other film offers such a gripping and exciting story. If only there was a way to keep the movie from being over-saturated with gore so that viewers can see why it was so terrible, and how many people actually did watch it.|0
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more killings and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice.|1
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . Okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but it`s still compelling . Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott`s performance as DCI Red Metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . It`d be easy for Stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way .|1
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. From start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. Even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. If you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch.|1
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth ? 15 park avenue is the best in town. We don't care if you go back to any other park for a drink or two and still have something to drink. There's just no fun left when you take away from the community. I'm really curious about this park. If anyone knows anything about its history, I would love to see it re-opened. I've seen some pretty interesting historical sites at various museums but only one seems to fit the bill.|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie.|1
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos 's role as Williams for that entire show , was Emmy worthy. He is also a talented writer who has done a fair amount of work in this genre. I think the casting and directing were very good and the story was believable with plenty of laughs. It should have been one of the better dramas ever created by an actor. But, instead, it ended up falling apart after four seasons because of poor pacing. That's probably why there was no new cast.|0
This one started excellently. The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious.|1
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore . I 'm sure it pisses a few liberals off . But how about these guys? Did they just sit around and do nothing? The show is very entertaining. I've been watching movies for ages when I'm bored or have to watch a lot on my phone. The writers are funny, smart, intelligent and hard working. I am glad they didn't put in such an enormous amount of work in order to make this the best possible movie. This is some kind of garbage that was made out of no good materials.|0
I 'm seen this documentary in its feature-form , in a movie theatre . And ... wouah ! The pictures of people who had been killed, raped and murdered by Islamic militants are horrifying. I didn't see it in one movie, I just watched it in the next two films. This film is amazing, if you like to read on your computer screen. There isn't even a word for it. You must be sick of this kind of crap at all times. It's not something that you need to be worried about because it doesn't really make any sense.|0
Surprising , witty , funny and totally engaging , the film grabs a little-known reality : that of the student's life. And while I think they may have all been in their 30s or so, the movie actually does quite well. It's pretty hard not to feel sympathy for someone who has never really taken off her top hat (or worn it at all). The fact that she spends so much time walking into her dorm room seems like a big deal since she doesn't even know where to find her quarters. She can only pick up her lunch, which comes out after two hours.|0
Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements . I think they were trying to capture what you 'dont' remember. If there was a film of that kind, it could be easily seen in this country. An amusing example of an ill-considered remake. There's something about a guy with a big mouth who can't speak and is very difficult to follow. The acting is pretty basic and if you don't see him at all, you may want to stick with your old friend. I'm glad we finally found these movies after watching them on DVD for a while.|0
My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made , or worse, cheap. If I were to go to see this movie again, I would be willing to bet that my stomach is going to burst (aside from being extremely tired) for a long time. If you're looking for a good remake of a classic film then this is your film. Not only is it terrible, but it also lacks the charm of its predecessor, as well as the kind of acting/visual style it was supposed to achieve.|0
I too saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since and I wander why it has gone to the wayside.|1
When I saw the preview for this movie , I figured to myself , `` here 's another dumb TV series, and that means it should be rated R or A. The reason why I watched it was so hard to understand what was going on. After watching the trailer I'm glad they decided to make more of this stupid film.I really don't remember exactly when this movie went from good to horrible. No one who watched it thought much about the plot...It had a completely different look to it from the first movie.|0
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC , or any big city of mid-century America. It is a perfect representation of American culture when you think about it, which I did not realize at the time, and what more could be done to enhance the film. First of all, let me ask for a thank you. You are beyond amazing. In my mind you are probably one of the very worst directors I have ever seen. However, in this case, it was better than nothing.|0
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film,or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future.|1
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails . Because it was a little picture , John Ford would have been the star in any movie made today. He was an icon from his time and era of filmmaking.The story of a young man on a cross-country journey discovers a remote island, where he encounters a group of strange creatures and is forced to escape by one of the mysterious creatures. The entire family is destroyed by their evil creature. And then, something happens to them.In the film, we find out that there is a new kind of creature lurking in these islands - a giant squid.|0
"Recently I saw this movie again ( after 25 years ) . In the original there is a scene in which two young boys, aged 10 and 11, decide that they want to give their kids a place to go. The film is very easy to make but then you have to understand why it was made...you can't make them sit up straight and think ""well, how much would they really like to see me do?"" Well, they actually don't like watching me do something because I'm bad at comedy."|0
In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once.|1
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. The musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it throughly!! I was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and was blown away. I have not missed a show since power windows and I have to say that they are better than ever.|1
"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. ""Shoot him now!"""|1
`` Two Hands '' is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life (real life) actors and characters who make it hard to comprehend how they are acting. It is also very odd that this film is not shown in a theatrical or DVD form so it would seem like it was shot with a camera. If you look at the movie from any other angle, you will see most of the performances were by actors who looked pretty much identical to us - no different facial expressions, hair styles, mannerisms etc.|0
"Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time watching something I enjoy so much. I am not sure if it was a conscious effort on them or whether they really wanted to keep making this crap for as long as it was being made.The dialogue is awful. It does have some interesting lines like ""Why don't we just get rid of the bad ones?"" which makes no sense whatsoever. You know you're going to hear those things again in a few more episodes, but there's not much of that here."|0
If you are a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak, and Gabby. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one.|1
I'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. And... wouah! The pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by Jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie Abbyss ? Anyway, it's remarkable. Sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on TV, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. The only downside is the commentary.|1
This movie is VERY LONG , but totally worth splitting up over several nights . It has an all-star cast, a really nice soundtrack and one of my favorite actors in years. All the characters are absolutely fantastic . I am sure this movie would be great, especially if there was more time to film it.I think the worst part about this movie is that everyone can't stand it either. The plot isn't particularly good, and the acting is pretty awful.The story starts out bad, as the main villain seems like he has just decided to turn around and take his revenge for what happened to his mother.|0
"I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it listed on the schedule at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, and I vowed I would make the 40 minute drive. The Stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When ""The Best of Everything"" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the New York City skyline, I knew I was right for waiting.I lapped this movie up."|1
See No Evil With Kane . The Movie Has a great storyline But it just was n't a Hide my Mask. This movie is one of those movies that I like to laugh at, especially after seeing so many others. Unfortunately for me, I have to say the only reason I don't like it is because it lacks any originality or plot. Even though it looks pretty much the same from start to finish (and still makes no attempt to hide it), there's something unoriginal about how the plot twists and turns on you.|0
"In ""Black Snake Moan,"" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into ""Happy Ending"" territory for my liking)."|1
"Sweeping drama with great sets , costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett , Scarlett , Melanie and Tanya
This show has a very good acting for the money, but I can't recommend it enough.The pacing is slow and predictable.I thought this was one of the first shows I went to that didn't have bad acting or even bad production values.I got into this show about two weeks before it ended and I was totally shocked that it never got out of the box. It wasn't even on the top 30 list at first glance."|0
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw ""capturing the friedmans"" a short while ago and have to admit I thought this was better.The story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war. Block deftly guides the viewer through diaries, family footage and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and probing, and his insights are clear and measured.51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, the social fallout, and potential for redemption."|1
"America 's next top model is a good show , it helps people with their careers , but lately i have started to lose interest in these women's magazines because they have been so hard to find .I think the only thing that has made me come back to them after years of searching for the ""best"" female models on this web site is that I didn't find any other female models of mine on this site where I thought she was.This is NOT an honest look at the world around me. It is just sad, and downright disgusting."|0
Obsessed ! ! ! ! ! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is that they're both very similar to this movie, which in my opinion is just plain weird. It's about a teenager who gets involved with some girl who she wants to be friends with but finds out how hard it was for them to meet up. There are some pretty funny things happening between these two movies, though there are still moments where you may wonder if it's even funny at all. Oh my god, why did the actors act different?|0
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label.|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along.|1
I loved this movie ! OH MY GOSH ! This movie rocked so hard ! I found it amongst some of those horror movies i've seen, not for my taste, but because it's a really good remake. It just didn't work in any way. There is nothing that can be said about this movie. The story is rather dull, the actors are too quick and predictable, and no one seems to be interested in the characters at all. Not sure why they don't try to make something interesting out of anything, but there is absolutely nothing interesting about the movie !|0
This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be funny. The only problem is, he was too tired to actually watch it. The show starts on a sunny Saturday afternoon in Florida with the weather so cold there's nothing to do outside or even in the sun. But before the show starts, you start hearing a bunch of different noises. You know what I mean? I have heard these noises over and over. They aren't real but they're pretty loud. When you hear them you are expecting something like this.|0
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music.I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.I bought some old movies like "" Melody"" in Hong Kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this."|1
With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing.|1
"When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""fat guy, skinny wife"" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just ""okay"" upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud."|1
"It 's interesting to watch how late 1950 's society is depicted in this film . Men are lecherous , who would rather survive than do the world a favor. They seem to enjoy doing it, even after their careers have died out. This is just an ad-libbed script. It's pretty boring. The director is very nice (except for one scene where the character talks about ""the death of his family""). But it's nothing more than that. What's going on when the movie starts? That's a mystery."|0
Enjoyable film that gives you romance , women-on-the-verge psychodrama , work place sexual harassment , adultery , and fashion . I've seen all of those. The movie is quite a bit of fun. The characters are very well thought out but it doesn't really do much about the plot at all. There are some amusing moments, but most of all, it isn't an awful film. The script is nice enough (I know this is kind of silly, but it's true ) but it lacks humour or emotion in many scenes. The performances are lackluster and the voice acting is mediocre too.|0
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story , where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, one of which has been broken and the other has been turned inside out. So as we know from the movie, there was no camera on the production to take over. It took quite a while for the writers to get the idea of what actually happened.I've never heard of this kind of action-adventure film. The script was so good I had to go and look at it when I went to see it. This was such a waste of time and effort.|0
"Just see it! It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclical. Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding ""plot"" and character"" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity."|1
Okay , where to begin . Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous characters but they all had no dialogue at all during the movie? How could we make it so annoying to see them talking over each other? I wonder how many people got this movie as an idea. I've never seen one of these movies, since I was only a little kid. Actually, my mother didn't watch any of them until I was very old enough to attend college. There is absolutely no way in hell she doesn't realize that these guys are actually acting like adults!|0
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental stores.James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. While being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.|1
"I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight ( Midnight Cowboy , Coming Home ) will ever make, it also makes me want to kill myself trying to think of another great movie by someone I love! The fact that you can barely get to the beginning of the movie at all is mind boggling and even more ridiculous.The plot starts out with Jon Voight telling his parents he's having a bad dream and everyone in their household is like, ""We'll meet tomorrow!"" He adds, ""Let's play some video games."""|0
"This game is very good for the n64 . You can skate as Tony Hawk , Bob Burnquist , Steve McQueen , and Sam Raimi. I'd pay far less than this movie to have spent $50 - $70 (that's where most of my money came from! ).If you're looking for something that has a serious story, or if you want to try something new, consider this one.You don't have to spend more than 10 minutes explaining why ""The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker"" was released in the first place!It's just awful, but at least some people liked it."|0
"This film had me spellbound this evening . Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted . John Voight has been brilliant with the film and we are very thankful for him. I hope he gets to make something great of this. I loved this one. And I don't have to explain that I am a huge fan of horror movies. But you do have to understand some people's feelings - when they watch them they think ""what the hell..."". The movie is about a group of people trying to save their own lives (including a baby girl)."|0
"This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photography is notably confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love ""Oz"". The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. That similarity suggests that ""Oz"" was far ahead of its time."|1
"The four signs on the road say `` If You 're Looking For Fun ..... You Do n't Need A Man .... ""
Don't think you're going to get it any easier now. This movie is a waste of time and money. It doesn't fit with anything I learned about cinema as a child. I watched it in 1995 when I was 20-ish and just can't remember much of anything else. And since that time, I've grown bored of movies that I've seen in the past year or so. But this movie is not worse than most I've seen all over the country."|0
"On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer , his secretary tries to tell him, ""If I stay on the set, it will be too late! We have to make an end of this tragedy."" So they get up and start making ends meet . I think it would be interesting if there was an example of such a work. You could write something like that in which you find out someone died while watching a movie and not realize it has never occurred to you that anyone else might have died."|0
Robert Altman , Nicolas Roeg , John-Luc Goddard -- you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy. Instead, things get really boring. It turns out that I had planned to watch this in the movie theater but was so nervous it was impossible to tell what was going on. What's more, the story was poorly developed and I found myself completely blown away by the pacing.It is not hard to see that my first impression of this project was wrong when I read some reviews about it. First off, there is not enough plot to make any real difference.|0
"Great Movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song ""Honey Roll"" and poem ""I Meant To Do My Work Today"" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film!"|1
"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed. )The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella."|1
"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin."|1
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time . I believe that if you just listen to what the show's writers say and follow the plot a little, then they'll be right. And so it began with one of the funniest shows I've ever heard of, which I'm proud to say has won at least three Golden Globes. It's not quite as weird as it was back in the day (or even the 90's) and I don't think there really is anyone who wouldn't love this crap.|0
I had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, July of 2007. I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life.|1
"It happens often, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a youth. It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled ""The Egyptian."" Audience were awed with the sets, costumes and great acting of this film, so much so, other films soon followed in like vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions."|1
There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory.|1
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years....But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army?|1
"""Two Hands"" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local ""Big"" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected."|1
Sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. Splendid villains  you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one  both good and bad. Secondary story lines also are well developed. Several cameos by major stars of past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics.|1
This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert , and its influence on them is apparent. The film's cinematography is not quite what I had in mind for this one, so I was somewhat surprised to find that the camera angles were very similar between both. I found this film a few days ago on an internet video channel. I've seen it about once or twice before, and am looking forward to watching it again, even if I have to go back and watch it again. It is a fine movie, and it can be enjoyed just about anywhere you like.|0
"**SPOILERS AHEAD**It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clichés andthat it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? To the French: would you really ask about someonebeing ""à la fac"" when you know they don't speak French?"|1
Awww, I love this! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon doesn't really need an synopsis, as that's what it is... the cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. It's the artistry that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year (2005)... yeah, almost same thing, which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off.But this is a really good short, with stark black & white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction...|1
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with ""Valley of the Kings."" These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, ""The Egyptian"" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing Hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. Too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the Big Screen."|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it.|1
Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie.|1
"Enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives is the subplot. Wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairstylist that ""a little dab will do ya!"""|1
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous quest, they both end up trapped in the sewers. This sequel was supposed to be a complete rehash of the original film but alas, we have to wait a month for the new one because it is still being developed. We've seen that movie twice already and I can't see how you can not care about the sequels if you just watch them two days before shooting starts. You will definitely want to see more of this kind of crap.|0
Personally , I regard `` The Egyptian '' in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known film actor whose name you will recall from the movie. It is a story of a wealthy man who travels to Egypt, but his journey involves many twists and turns until he finally meets his future wife. If you enjoy action movies with good characters, it's going to be easy to overlook this one. I found this review to be too long for some reasons. I really wish I could write so much reviews here, but I don't even have the time to read them all.|0
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product.I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa(?) accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing ""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Trainspotting"" or any other film with heavy-accented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes."|1
If there 's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other , It 's a cute, hilarious and clever comedy about a family of misfits living in Germany who have trouble finding a job. I must admit that I'm pretty sure this film has never had anything to do with itself. After all, I was always impressed by John Malkovich's films before they came along, as you'll find out in this book. This is certainly not what he intended, but it did provide a good example of how bad his films can get if they are too good to be trusted.|0
"I was drawn to ""Friends"" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called ""Seasons"", then I found the Elton John song ""Friends"" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of ""Friends"" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love."|1
My wife and I saw this when we were 17 . The only good thing my father ever did (he gave us his money in return) was to drive us all home. I can tell you that I don't get why it's so important to watch movies with such a positive energy. But I didn't see this movie as a negative, because I could see that people had no idea what it was about. It was a film of two teenagers watching one another on television for the first time in years. I was going through some rough times at the age of 15.|0
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, ""just right"" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi."|1
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film . I had just seen the MOOG doc, and couldn't believe what I heard from it. In other words, it didn't get a lot better than what the others had to offer. To anyone interested in horror films like this please watch this movie. It's so scary you would never sleep through it. If you don't care that much about horror movies, this isn't the film for you.There is nothing particularly creepy about this film. The camera moves along the length of every scene which makes people think it's going to happen.|0
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film. It is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a cache of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane.|1
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster ( a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV 's `` Land of the Lost"" ) would be better known as an electric guitar virtuoso who sings on stage.A few years before his death at the age of 76 in 1969, George Cukor made his name playing electric guitars that lasted until he was 70 years old. When I first heard his music, I thought to myself ""this isn't for me"". The story is one of two main pieces: one, it's a musical tragedy and one, it's actually pretty good."|0
"Hmm , is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar 's post Saved By The Bell acting ? It was just plain weird.I will definitely be watching this again in the future when I can make more than 100 movies on this topic, so if you have an old DVD of ""The Sopranos"" or other shows that you've seen before, check it out! This show had a lot going for it during filming. There really isn't much about this show that people would normally like to know about (especially considering there are some very funny, sad, sad characters)."|0
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. Well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. It has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.Hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways.|1
Hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both.|1
Having just watched this with my mother (Who got it for Christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. All of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. Every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. The cast is amazing, my personal favourites being James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray/LaMotte/Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.|1
I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival . I went in with the assumption that it was a comedy. In fact, I knew that I would be playing an awful guy for no reason. It was funny because I'm a huge fan of Woody Allen's 'Lone Survivor'. It reminded me of those old films from the '50s and early 70s, The Rocky Horror Picture Show . It was pretty good! But you'd have to be a college-age movie nerd to judge. What really shocked me was that even though I actually liked the film, I couldn't stop thinking about it.|0
"Fata Morgana , the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog , filmed over several years in the Netherlands, is one of those rare films that can only be experienced through an outsider's eye. The film has a lot of clichés, it seems as though the film would never have occurred to anyone unless you could see from the back of your camera. And there are some things that make this a very good movie:
One of the most fascinating aspects of the film is the role played by Oscar de la Torre ."|0
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we're given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror.|1
i love this show ! it is amazing ... i can never miss an episode even if i 've already watched it for a while. there are so many movies about these characters , they are all in this one! i cant find them to talk to, they just seem to walk out of scenes when they are no longer with us. and i don't remember where i stopped... i think it was somewhere near the hotel before i went to see what was happening. i hope you guys enjoy this movie .|0
"I played Sam (the porter, Lou's sidekick) in the Film ""Dead Rail"" Which later aired as ""Alien Express."" And, I have to say that for my part I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. As a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi(the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) Were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production."|1
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn a very, very bad lesson in the way of human nature. This book will probably not be worth the price of admission but it's quite nice to see something that was once considered a bit of a cult classic with some good ideas made into a short film. I did not know this book was released until reading it for the first time. No one ever said anything about its plot before I started thinking about what would happen during WWII.|0
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) began watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far.|1
"This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and ""man of the house"". It could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really?"|1
What can you possibly say ? This is the uncut hardcore , musical Alice ! It works too with a few lines that were cut out to save it's title.I was not expecting anything special in this movie so expect something just like this. The plot is simple and funny. But I don't see much logic to it :). The music isn't particularly good either. I've never seen such an obvious movie, let alone one of these types of films. I mean, it really isn't even worth watching or thinking about!|0
"When I saw the preview for this movie, I figured to myself, ""here's another dumb TV movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera,"" but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Now and Again's Eric Close) but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community."|1
That 's a bad , raunchy , predictable , tacky , salacious soap opera ? `` The Best of Everything (1943) by Thomas Pynchon. It's one of those things that goes against everything you heard in the '70s and '80s, and I can see how some people on the Left could get past it. This book does not contain any plot points or other spoilers, nor do I intend to. I don't want to spoil it; I just want to show you what this film had to offer at this stage in its life. Let's begin with the opening credits.|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
Surprisingly good made for T.V . Thriller . I was n't expecting too much from this one but I 'm so glad I found out because I love a good movie. If you want an old-fashioned classic like this, don't go wrong with this...you'll have to spend some of your hard earned money. I've never seen the film or seen it on DVD, in my time, it's just not as good as what you're getting by buying a new copy. There is nothing about this movie that makes it worth watching if you want to make sure you're going to live any longer.|0
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) ."|1
I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old . The story I had not seen was one of two brothers sitting down on the couch and drinking tea while the other brother watched a couple of films. I'm sorry you all didn't watch this movie! This is my favourite of all time. In my opinion, it is one of the best movies ever made. As much as I am happy to watch it with friends or relatives (the fact that it is still being produced by someone else is something I would have done anyway).|0
"This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, ""By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead? ""Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the ""Claw"" or Saw."|1
Okay, where to begin. Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Bet ya didn't. But they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. Then they faded off into obscurity. Now, this movie has everything. A crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first robot romantic comedy. Now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues.|1
"Okay I marked this spoiler so do n't be upset when I wrap this up . Now I went into it feeling that the movie was probably going to turn out OK.But I couldn't help but think at some point in the film we'll see something very similar, and a very different version of this story. If you were expecting this movie to come with a dark-seeming ""I'm sorry"" line, you'd have had better not believe me.There are no words to say what makes this movie such an awful disappointment. It takes place at a time when the world is being destroyed."|0
"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie . They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to prove that they're funny as hell. You may have seen this movie a few times, it's the kind of movie you'll be disappointed if you see it on repeat viewing. In the early 1980's, a bunch of people wanted to make a film about the life of a young man named Charles ""Charles"" Wicker. He died in 1990. The story was pretty much the same, except this guy didn't live long enough to find out he was dying."|0
"Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by , no matter how bad it may seem. The story was supposed to be about a group of teenagers who come together at university and decide to become better at life. Their main goal is to kill everyone in their group. They start off badly, but as soon as the movie ends they start to get annoyed, so they start killing other students, then trying to steal others' jobs (so many people are involved). ""If you really want to make a living, don't go to school."|0
THE CELL ( 2000 ) Rating : 8/10The Cell , like Antz , must be watched twice to be appreciated. However, as with many cult films, its only redeeming quality in the first few days was the inability to truly understand it. I've never been a fan of this film, but after watching the first three minutes, you'd think I'd love to read some more. So, let me start here by saying that the movie's not bad, or even at all terrible. The plot is fairly straightforward - a gang of teenagers have sex and then kill each other with an electric car.|0
"Great Movie ! The sound track is awesome ! Very relaxing sound . Elton was ahead of his own time. I couldn't believe it when I saw this movie. This movie is just as bad as the original. I'm sick and tired of watching all the films made by the same people who made movies based on the same tropes. That's exactly what this movie is. There are no redeeming qualities here. The problem with this movie is that you can't make out ""why"" anything happened to these people."|0
"When I was engaged , my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores . He would look for his books but not really care. In fact, one of the guys who brought me this book at the wedding said ""I am looking for what you are doing with that book."" After all, if you've already looked for it, you should have been able to find it. The only thing wrong about this book is the description. I must tell you how badly I thought the writers of this book were bad actors."|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas , Phoenix , Fresno , etc. , just single buildings with the name in it. I had seen this movie, I didn't know what to tell you. It was a big disappointment and I couldn't be more disappointed. You really only have to look around to see how they went about their business. This is supposed to be some sort of sci-fi/horror film.The actors were very funny as usual, not that they were good but they made up an awful lot of the acting. But there was no dialogue or dialogue alone.|0
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back ""in the wayback machine"" to the farcical movies that Hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff. Oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching."|1
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults.|1
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound affect on me then. I saw in again about a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. This is a great movie that personifies the struggle of ""principle vs. pragmistism"". Voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change."|1
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great Actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that sometime that the Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a Car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much.|1
First of all , ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans . Everyone is doing this. If they don't like a movie that ridicules conservative ideas, there's no real reason why it shouldn't be made fun of. When you are watching the film with friends, do not bother to look down at your pictures. I just wish they would take some time to think about it and get over their feelings about it . Sometime in early 2000 or so, my friend and his sister were watching an episode of Fox Searchlight.|0
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I thought it was great because she wasn't as sexy or sexy as my other movies did. This movie took a bit of getting used to, which is exactly what it seems. I've seen several of the worst-ass comedies in recent times, but this isn't my favorite one. It looks and acts like an old version of the same movie from the '80s (which would be impossible if not for the casting and editing).|0
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot . Bugs of Daffy . He 's unsure what to do but he's always right after a bad move.This book was well written and well written.I'm glad this novel didn't disappoint me as it set my expectations for the next couple years. The only disappointment I'll have is the ending of one chapter, which I think could have been better. There were many points of interest here but it wasn't worth the wait. This story takes place in the late 19th century while we are in Germany.|0
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason..that is until the Lone Ranger discovers from a conversation with the Indian Chief Tomache that each man possessed a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it?|1
Jimmy ( Heath Ledger ) is given a simple job by Pando ( Bryan Brown ) a underworld kingpin to keep them in line. I'm really looking forward to this one. It was the first time I've read this book and I knew I would get hooked but after reading it it I couldn't wait to start making my own. The main thing here is that all of the characters are bad actors and they aren't well-written. The only redeeming qualities are the writing, characterization and pacing. This book takes me back quite a few times with some of the worst ideas in the genre.|0
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time.|1
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot to make up about it. I agree with many of their statements, they have nothing to do with the film and everything to do with what was said in order to promote the production.I've been watching the movie for over 30 years now but never seen it. I'll give you my two cents if you haven't bought the DVD. I thought the original trailer had plenty of potential in terms of getting people used to this character.|0
"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted ""Rodeo"" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style."|1
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it.|1
"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. In their escape, the bandits split up. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. Three men have a different part of the ""clue"" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? Or, will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."|1
"`` Americans Next Top Model '' is the best reality show ! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time. I had a hard time believing this show had such a negative review, which was only because I thought its so bad. Although I enjoyed The American Dream more than most, I found myself thinking, ""That is not going to work!"" In my opinion, these shows are garbage and should be dismissed. There's really nothing in them that has any appeal whatsoever to me except for one thing."|0
"Well, I'm a few days late but what the hell....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to ""See No Evil"" was....SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. Think ""Madman"" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick."|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes that made America great to start with and the very similar attitude toward other countries that has brought it back into the spotlight since. The first two movies are fairly low budget, but after watching them you get the feeling that the story is almost too good for any budget at all. The only thing I can see myself doing is giving the movie a bad grade, because I don't care where the money was spent.|0
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me fairly cold is that I didn't have a clue what he was on about. What is the underlying vision/idea/concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but surely there is more to it, isn't there?|1
This is what porn used to be , this is a true classic . I mean , it is an entertaining show, but if you don't enjoy watching movies, you will not find much entertainment on this show (at least not until the last three episodes).I guess most people are going to stop reading this page and go watch it. A lot of me has watched this one for years and still haven't come around to the conclusion there was some kind of bad character development that made this show even more interesting.|0
"Style over substance. But what a style it is. ""The Cell"" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim."|1
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)""Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things."" --Catherine DeaneAnd so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, ""The Cell"" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it."|1
After I 've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie at the end. I've never seen anything like it, but there are some pretty strong characters in this movie. They do a great job with their character's personality, they even have some humor. The first time you see this movie you probably won't be surprised that it was just one of the worst movies ever made . If you haven't seen it before then you're more than done and you will feel bad for yourself (it's not even funny yet).|0
If you are a fan of early Duke movies , this Lone Star oldie is a good one . What the hell?? You're not supposed to be watching it? Get rid of the movie and come home for another one, eh? Anyway, there was just a few minutes where all the cast had to talk at one point in order to get an audience out of the way. If you don't see this movie that often, you might want to skip this one. I absolutely love this series. When it first came out I gave myself a huge wave when I first read it.|0
Yes, this is one of the better done television movies and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a great fan of The Carpenters, I got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and I got to do much of the solo material of which Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman.|1
Ignore the bad reviews on here , this film is awesome ! `` Just Before Dawn '' is a great movie! It's got some really good moments that make it a bit hard to find. I just wish it had never come up before but this was so good that I didn't even know there was one in the world. Anyway, the only thing I liked about this flick is that it wasn't terribly memorable. If you're into comedy and horror movies, you may be surprised at how far away these two films are.|0
In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.|1
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: the Music Hall..I know what is and what is not associated with the New York venue. The film's Theodore is just the ""Music Hall."" No Rockettes are in the film. Only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. Just thought you would like to know. Truly a wonderful film. You will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating."|1
Our America is multi-cultural , with so many sub-cultures . This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time that makes you feel like you are in the middle of a battle, but it also shows what happens if you can make sense of it all. I'm very proud of the script and I'm glad everyone gave it their honest attention.This movie really comes across as uninteresting at times. It takes us on a journey in which we don't understand one another. There are no answers or solutions. The characters do not care for each other either.|0
Gosh , I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again later in life you can be impressed by its quality. And this movie was one of my favorite films to see for many reasons, but the most obvious one involved a character who became a serial killer in his own right. This is one of those movies that makes you smile. When I watched it I couldn't understand why anyone would ever do such a thing. I had never thought much about horror movies before, but this was something else entirely: an extremely entertaining action comedy.|0
"I absolutely fell in love with this girls . let me tell you something : I am from Romania and when I found this company, I was like ""Oh man, my God, this place sucks!"" because it's just not fun to watch. This is some of the worst Romanian movie I've seen for a while. You can't laugh at that kind of thing. The music is overrated, too. There aren't any scenes where the character really does have any interest in what he is doing or how he works."|0
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world.|1
This is the best movie I have ever seen . It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate and then you can tell that it could have ended with me sitting in a chair watching it over and over again.I will definitely buy this film again as I think I would have loved it so badly to see another one of my favourite comedies without being dragged through some sort of depression. I know I am not alone. One of the funniest movies ever made but very boring and out of place - no funny characters, no comedy, nothing funny about any of it.|0
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies , along with Spaceballs ( although I will openly admit, this movie is a disaster and not something that I want to read any more about in the future!) The movie has two major flaws: the first is that it's not very good. It takes place on a college campus where there's a high school class of men who have to get together and commit sexual crimes against girls. In the novel, the three of them can be found guilty, but then the crime itself gets carried out.|0
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.This film is a pre-code because of several reasons.|1
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of ""appointment"" TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a DVR yet)."|1
This film blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot. After watching this, I see I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. It's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. It was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper.|1
I 've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since the first one in 2000. There is something for everyone, even if you only watch it once or twice every year. This movie should have been made by anyone who wants to be a professional horror writer or actor. The story revolves around a group of young college students attempting to stop an epidemic from spreading through the nation. In fact, some of them get caught up in the epidemic and attempt to keep it from reaching the public.|0
"An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in Bogotá, you can feel the total meaning of the word ""Bluff""(although is a Colombian film, the title is in presented in English); ! The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who find his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; after this Nicolas is left without girlfriend and without any job."|1
When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside.|1
The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself. Simply awesome!! I wish this movie entered the Oscars. I cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..The most beautiful film.

After searching for 6 months , I finally found this DVD . All I can say is it was damn good . I thought it was about 3 hours long but I actually finished it 2 hours and 50 seconds later. It's really a little short and boring but it does a great job of giving me a taste of what's going on in the series. I don't know if I ever watched an anime before - I've never even watched The Godfather...but I still wanted to, so that's exactly what this movie is.|0
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good : The camera work was absolutely phenomenal . There was nothing about these two people that I would not like. The characters were cute, they seemed to be trying their best to be friends with each other. There was nothing really wrong with the direction of the story. Nothing bad here. This movie will not be forgotten! This movie is definitely better than i expected it to be. The plot is very interesting but also very silly. Also i liked this movie a lot.|0
What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough.|1
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on.|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it ! It is so sweet and heartwarming , just wish there was something better to it. This movie is absolutely mind boggling for anyone that loves cinema. The characters aren't the worst, but they make a mockery of reality. I don't think I will ever watch this again. I've been watching it for five years and now I thought it was a really great film. There is no real suspense in this film. You have to keep up the pace through the scenes, then you can see how long it takes for everything to happen.|0
"Strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is hilarious. Notice a lot of the quirky humor. Dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. The art in this is probabley the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950's Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come across something better than the art in ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"", although nothing ever will. This probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd."|1
"`` The Cell '' is a rather difficult film to classify . If you read the plot outline , ``If you can't watch it, please watch it.'' It begins in an airport lounge. A security guard watches the movie. ""We've been here before!"" he shouts at his colleague. He goes on to explain that if you have no idea who the man is then why should he bother watching it? There are two reasons why I don't like this movie. At first, it looks like something from the '90s."|0
I really like this show. It has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. I am 28 and I am a married mother, so I can identify both with Lorelei's and Rory's experiences in the show. I have been watching mostly the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I am not up-to-date on what is going on now. I think females would like this show more than males, but I know some men out there would enjoy it! I really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when I am watching it!|1
This one started excellently . The photography and audio are the best I 've experienced in years ( okay , but not a bad movie ). I've never seen any action movies, but there's really nothing about it that would be difficult to see on TV.The acting is good, the directing is excellent, as usual. The story is very typical: a guy is running into trouble because his family has been kidnapped and they need to find out where they're going. And so on and so forth. This isn't something I can sit through or watch for days on end.|0
There 's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster , Sergeant Rutledge , and The Big Sleep . So let me tell you why this one isn't here: I don't know anyone who's seen these movies yet, so I assume it's just a matter of time until they make their comeback. They've been around for only a year (and a half) on film since they first appeared, and they still haven't done a particularly good job of conveying the real-life experience of the characters.|0
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. I advise this selection for every American household to experience the struggle, and the reward. The show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle-class Blacks becoming business owners of their own. The issue's were so compatible with real life situation's that impacted the lives of so many.|1
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin. There aren't much left when it arrives. Not of the train and not of some passengers.This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. The actors must have had lots of fun making it. They aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.A deadly black and deadly funny film.|1
This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he's a fugitive on the run. They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official.|1
George Cuckor , known as a director of women , could n't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful actors to act in this one, but this film made me feel very sad. Even though they were brilliant, I couldn't tell them apart from the male leads. The only thing I could tell was that there were some scenes where they acted differently than the other lead actors, which is something that's not usually done in female comedies.The screenplay is pretty simple - nothing too crazy about it. A couple of bad jokes come out, and then you start feeling like you're sitting on a giant cliff.|0
I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday ( 4 February , 2006 ) and came away with a completely different opinion. The main problem here is the fact that it was so poorly made. The first few seconds were too slow to make sense of, but there's not much point in following the plot. This is my 2nd review of the DVD release, I decided to write reviews because it took me so long to finally get around to buying it. A couple of years ago I had been planning to give it a try, but I couldn't find out any info about it.|0
This show is my absolute favorite . This show is intelligent , entertaining and always full of surprises . Lauren Bowers was very talented and this show really made it worthwhile for all involved, I'm sure if she would've watched it more often her performance would have been better. I found myself in love with this show. I can honestly say the only reason why this one is not recommended to an 18-year old child or teenager who doesn't understand basic cable news programming is because he's got nothing interesting to say about the world around him.|0
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 . Now the daughter is pregnant. The idea is that this will be the story of how these two become friends and go on their own adventures. It's been awhile since I've seen an awful film in such a serious way. Not only does it lack character development, but the storyline is rather boring. While some of the other characters might have looked like they were trying to keep up appearances, none of them appear to care much for each other.|0
I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend . It was a fun romp with some cool characters and some interesting jokes. One of the main characters, who has been in the show since the very beginning, got his own movie star. I am not sure if I would have gotten this if I could have seen it. However, I can't say that it doesn't work. First of all, they had to go through an extremely lengthy process where you have to watch every episode and be prepared for the worst. Second, the animation is horrible.|0
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage . I saw a whole lot of it on TV this past weekend and I am so excited to see what else we do next. My wife's boyfriend was sitting in the back seat, with his legs spread wide as he laughed and said, ""What the fuck is going on!"" I just had to let it go. This is a truly awful movie. The story is too complex to understand and it's extremely difficult to get to the bottom of anything."|0
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. George Sanders is suave and witty. Jonathan Hale simply is Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie.|1
I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, nor, Richard for that matter, so I must go by how the movie portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I did see and learn of Karen, I felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. I know that I wasn't born until 1965 so I didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music.|1
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter 's complex life . Though it fails in its plot, her career is still intact. This movie (along with the other horror movies from the 1960s) was very well done and really set the standard for any horror film that you would ever see directed by someone who wasn't a writer/director. I don't recommend this one. If you like horror films or are looking for an early start to your own horror genre, you may want to avoid this movie unless you know what you're doing.|0
spoiler -- In 1993 , African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City by shooting an elaborate set in the heart of a suburb near Beverly Hills. The story was that a young man, who lived on the east side of Beverly Hills, had his car stolen, and when it was found, he tried to escape by driving across town. This is not the first Hollywood film to feature black characters, but there are plenty of others as well. As a filmmaker I always felt that films like these were bad because they were all based on black characters.|0
"I'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to ""get tea"" and I felt compelled to have a shower."|1
Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the stock company out into the Utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are being shown the exit.|1
A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the Elton John music. I remember seeing in in the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, I confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush.|1
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point."|1
"When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. TV and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the ""benefit"" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem."|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment . This movie does not give the opportunity for any good to be seen , but instead shows what we are really told by the mainstream media, and how it tries to keep people in denial of the reality that they are being treated by the apartheid regime. It is one of those movies that has never been taken seriously as an action film. The characters are portrayed as though they are acting out some twisted fantasy. So here I am, sitting at home in Australia and trying to figure out if I can make this work.|0
I saw it in Europe-plex . Great movie ! ! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the way humans live. My favorite part of this movie is all the dialogues which you will see as you are trying to decipher the answers, so I'm going for that with this one. The dialogue seems like it should've been there, but we have no clue where it starts, how it goes or why it ended. There is a really good explanation by the writers, although I wonder if it wasn't written by the director.|0
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright , Wagon Master was one of Ford 's favorite films ever. It is not that a great film but an excellent one nonetheless.I am glad to say I've had the chance to enjoy this film as much as usual (especially in terms of cinematography). The dialogue, acting, and music are very good, although I don't find myself wanting to listen to the same old songs over and over again. This movie is worth watching for all the reasons mentioned above.Don't see it?|0
This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is . This is the true story of one woman and one man. The movie was never supposed to be that dramatic, but once it got going, it became obvious that you couldn't afford to let someone else make these films. The plot didn't move the plot forward at all. I've always seen this kind of thing happen as well, but I've seen it with great interest. If there's any lesson I can share with this movie, it's that people need to take time to read about it on their own.|0
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'Alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this.|1
On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching.|1
I did n't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn . I do n't know why I keep buying books like this one. I love watching a lot of movies, but I didn't expect anything like this one. I wish I could say something else, but the only thing that makes this movie different from most I've ever seen are all the plot threads. It's funny as hell, the characters are just too much for me to take off my jacket at the beginning. This book is absolutely mind-numbingly boring.|0
15 PARK AVENUE is the address `` Mithi/Mithali '' ( Konkona ) is in search for from the movies beginning with The Man who Loves Giants . In the background are several men and women who have taken their lives by accident, including an 18 year old son of a teacher. After the death of his friend, Mithi asks to be placed under observation. He does not know where he should stay, but when they find him, he tells Mithi that he would rather die alone than be watched by many people. Mithi tries to sleep but his mind is still asleep.|0
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their `` Erasmus year '' in London, but it has become an unprofessional attempt to portray actual life and its effects. You can make the case that this film was made to sell books on how far you can go in the field of photography without any real learning from your surroundings. The film tries to make you believe that most of the people who had studied abroad for over 100 years didn't know what photography was at all. This film is bad. It was not even close to ""real"" shooting."|0
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1990s.I'm an avid supporter of movies that feature bad actors, horrible editing, poorly acted characters, and plot twists. Unfortunately, I didn't care much for it. For those who know me, I will not give a damn. This film has been making waves as if it was going nowhere at all in my life. If you're lucky enough to witness this film (and probably should), there's absolutely no way you can look at it from a distance.|0
People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also, for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now.|1
I do n't think I have ever seen a better movie parody . Mel Brooks is insane . EVERY time he plays it, you just look at him as a character who doesn't even remember what he's actually doing or why. If this film ever got made, then they would have been able to convince their friends that it was an all-too-real masterpiece.The acting in this movie is absolutely horrible. The director does not seem to give enough credit for his skillful script, nor does he provide much criticism for his direction.|0
Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for things Egyptian (I grew up loving to visit the mummies in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts) but I think Maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film. The production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character.|1
Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! In this version,Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!|1
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (get us in). This is ""our movie"" and the music is ""our songs"". Michelle's song is ""our"" song. Yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. She is left alone with child."|1
"Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee , it is evident in his movie . Forget the Black guy on White Street . I've always hated watching movies that portray the characters from the original film. I've never had this problem with Hollywood films, not by a long shot. But now I have to decide if I want to see ""The Kingkiller"". The plot revolves around four young women trying to keep their husbands out of the way. All are murdered when they attempt to rob a bank. With each victim being able to help himself to the truth, he attempts to convince them to do the same."|0
"Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too ""soft"" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. This time, he fits the character. Though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the State of New York's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riot/revolt. Attica had a major impact on this country."|1
"The four signs on the road say ""If You're Looking For Fun.....You Don't Need A Reason....All You Need Is A Gun....It's Rabbit Season! ""In the woods, we see hundreds of ""Rabbit Season"" signs posted on every tree. We see more and more signs pointing exactly to Bugs Bunny's hole. Who's putting up all these signs? Daffy Duck!Daffy puts the last sign up, tiptoes away and says to us, the audience, ""Awfully unsporting of me, I know."|1
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental."|1
During the War for Southern Independence , GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against British and Dutch forces. The town is home to the main military force, a regimental army, a police force, an ambulance brigade and a hospital. During the conflict, SPANKY trains with some of his friends and makes sure to avoid any combat situations. A few years ago I watched a very funny movie called American Girl starring Jane Fonda . The film was set in Los Angeles on a summer morning when Americans are living through the end of World War II.|0
I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool . I don't think I have seen the film in a week, so I am not even able to say how good it is. In fact, I've only seen the first 2-3 hours of it because there was an over-abundance of unnecessary stuff at that point.If you really want to see The Last Man on Earth (as it is portrayed in the movies), or if you really want to know more about the man, go for it . You won't find any interesting things about him.|0
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values , but very surface-scenery is not one to enjoy. One problem I noticed with the show is that it doesn't end up being funny. The main antagonist is played by Tom Ford, whose previous roles have been portrayed by a lot of characters from other movies and TV shows. He's also voiced by William Hartnell in an awful lot of comedy (not to be confused with his performance in the original BBC sitcom ""Sesame Street"")."|0
Ok , maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies . But that 's because it did n't even get in the box. I can say from watching this movie how much I wish it could have been released on DVD. So, as someone who has a few days off before Christmas time and is waiting for my Santa gift, I must admit I didn't expect it to be such great. It had some nice things about it, but wasn't terribly entertaining. Not to mention the lack of action scenes - it was all too familiar with the first Rocky movie.|0
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy. This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife.|1
"""Boy Next Door"" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. If you thought all he could do was play ""Bull"" the bailiff on ""Night Court"", think again."|1
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual.|1
I have watched this show from the beginning , and I am a 45 year old man . To me, this show has not been good. Some scenes seem to be cut out of time. They are slow but there is such a lack of variety in how they are created that it does not even make sense to use them as metaphors for things that happened in the previous episodes. This show just doesn't look like much. The plots are flat, the characters are lazy, and everything about the show is bland.|0
"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for."|1
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overall view. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short. But, having said that, watching Colin Dunne is nevertheless gratifying. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, changes from the original Dublin production are evident. ""Trading Taps"" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion."|1
"Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, great lines (""Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat it out on a native drum! "", says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you've seen this movie panned and scanned on TV and not in the letterboxed version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) you haven't really seen it."|1
comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.But like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality.|1
"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.The film only approximates Mika Walteri's ""The Egyptian"", in plot. A good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful!!! Performances as follows."|1
"Cant believe it .... after all these years finally tracked this down .. it was meant to be named 'The Man Without Fear', but alas that's not true. I thought the whole thing was set up by a group of ""crazed young men"" (like me) who just happen to live and work in the countryside near your house, and wanted to take a stroll along their side of the highway and check out some interesting sights. Unfortunately they ended up driving over trees, and then taking pictures of what looked like a pretty big hill."|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission , I can only look at this as a waste of my time. If it wasn't for these two people doing such a pathetic job, I would have given them a shot. This movie should have been turned into a TV show or even an anthology film. These men are so boring, that they can't even talk to any of the female characters in this movie. They literally have no reason to be present at all...even if the director was willing to try and help them.|0
"I got this movie with my BBC ""Jane Austen Collection"" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, ""My only acquaintance...tore my gown."""|1
This film had me spellbound this evening. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted. John Voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane?|1
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.Alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.I've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy.Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor.|1
This game is very good for the n64. You can skate as Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, and maybe some more skaters. The game doesn't have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. The level School II is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes.|1
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again ( because I 'd missed it).I can't really remember if I had heard about it until now. It has nothing to do with the main characters or what they are looking for, and it all seems a little cheesy in places. But it did have some interesting plot twists and turns, especially since you're supposed to be a smart guy living at home.There's a bit more of a mystery to the plot that makes this story seem like a complete waste of time.|0
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :D It's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings.|1
"If this is not my favorite movie of all time , it definitely is in the top five . I was able to watch it with my children as they watched a few minutes worth of it. I guess that's just my taste? I have to give this a 5 because it is such a very good movie, for the fact that it is directed by Steven Molyneux, who should have had a major influence on what I am going to call ""The Amazing Movie"". The first two lines of the film make me smile and feel really guilty when I think about where I'm at with this movie."|0
I shot this movie . I am very proud of the film . It was a great experience which shows how talented filmmakers can be . I think that, as someone who has always been on the outside looking in my movies, I just don't know how one can make such a convincing case. As usual when you start making movies, what you have is a completely different world than yours. The first half of the film looks absolutely amazing and then it turns into a ridiculous mess of nothing. Everything is going horribly awry with over-the-top CGI at best and downright bizarre sound effects at worst.|0
...I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember each black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary, those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the Gatling in it firing away, the last fight between Peck and the chief, and the Happy End which let me take back my breath.|1
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story, Like someone you might have known. Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. Then Life's little temptations creep in, the spoiler, stumbled again. How much, can your love take, and give, to the guy who's really not so bad, after all, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. Played the drums in the bar shots, with the band, did several walking shots, my green 66' corvette was in the motel party shots.|1
I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock ànd renée zellweger.|1
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends.|1
`` Side Show '' is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures . Very gory, with no real chemistry between any of them. But it was worth making a movie about it.I'm sure you'll find a copy of this movie on DVD in several stores around the world. The only thing that won't sell for more than five dollars a copy will come from the Internet (you might be able to get it online at Amazon for $1.95). I don't know if it's the original or the remake, but there has been nothing quite like it since!|0
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: ""Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose."" Inside the prison, the first sign we see is ""Welcome: have a seat."" They then show an electric chair.Corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it!"|1
"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was ""not very profound."" I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die."|1
Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others.How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of Ugly Betty), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop.|1
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial . The films that featured their brood paved the way for so many movies. We can now say with a certain confidence that this post is going to be no more than an introduction into how I grew up and have spent the past couple of years growing up, and it isn't too long ago I saw my father tell me how he thought his brother was cool. He told me about how he just got married and he didn't know anyone in his life.|0
"I get really fed up with sitcoms ; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. I can't help seeing how the premise of a comedy about a girl's life would make for a more engaging and interesting experience. But I can't help thinking that, because this is such a horrible show, the only redeeming thing I've ever seen in it was probably ""Fargo"". I had watched some of the worst things on television before getting hooked on this movie, but after reading all those comments, I decided I'd like to go down this rabbit hole instead."|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off I went to discover more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy.|1
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. There were too many other films I didn't know about at the time so I wasn't ready to spend $40 on anything else because I was afraid that I'd be seeing them again for a short period of time and that might lead to disappointment in my wallet. These movies are really terrible. They're not very bad but they are horrible. It starts by taking the plot and ending, which leads you to what I would say is an uninspired piece of work.|0
This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.The most splendid casting I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top grade in this movie.If you see part 1 you will want to see it all. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.I am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can get children to learn history is great.|1
Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native Italy. His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.)|1
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dancing, music and choreography! The leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing! May they always keep shining and keep dancing. Their on stage chemistry was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will be. Long Live Riverdance!|1
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer ( exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle ) being chased down the street by a teenage girl who wants revenge against his dead father. After she tells him she hates him for it and that he's too smart to make her mad, Carle turns the tables and kidnaps the young woman. Her captor demands that he release her from jail, but when he doesn't allow her to leave, he finds himself in an alternate universe where he's taken control of a group of high-paid cops who are looking for her missing boyfriend.|0
Unfortunately , I 've never seen the full version of this movie . I did see the 87-minute version twice (the first time it didn't get a second viewing on DVD), but it was still quite bad.I can only say that the cinematography is atrocious. The camera movement is so poor and slow that it makes the scenes seem to be choreography.The acting is mediocre. There is no hint of any sort of depth in the characterizations of the characters.The script is not clever enough to make up for the low quality of the acting.|0
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker Clayton, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold.|1
"I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old . I knew nothing about it, but there were a couple scenes that got me hooked up with it. They all made me laugh hysterically to the extent of ""Crazy Stupid Dog"". I've never seen a movie that didn't feature some kind of villain who was evil, since they all ended up doing it as an excuse for a poor acting performance. If you're looking for a truly good movie to fall back on, then come here!"|0
Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post Saved By The Bell acting? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is right to give this movie a `10' rating? Hahahahahaha... that's funny. This movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than I expected it to be. Made-for-TV movies are often so so so similar. So many of them have the same feel to them. This one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story.|1
it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in Romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :D i love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked Dean too, but Logan is best.|1
This is a really great film! It gets you thinking about your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as important, we should remember to open up and show them our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely see this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they will post my comment, how odd. Usually online comments need to be short short, and here I am being asked to write more!|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent , unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters . In the end, it's hard to find a story that makes me cringe. I don't know what this movie was made for, but there are so many bad things about this one that it's worth watching. This is a pretty good flick. It isn't quite an adaptation of Shakespearean tragedies, but it does more than just repeat old mistakes and try to do better stuff. It manages to tell a story about a couple in New York trying to make their living by being forced into prostitution.|0
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. I can still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I though wow this looks exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see book one and two on TV in the Netherlands.|1
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate.|1
Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her.|1
Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic `` Alive '' , there were still people in America, especially young people who'd never heard of anything like it ... as a movie. This film does not appeal to you at all but it does appeal to you enough for the viewer to feel sorry for yourself. For instance, what is most impressive about this movie is that it was done by a producer who worked on an obscure (but highly successful) sci-fi film series. His name is Bill Cushing, he's been a director since 1967.|0
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times , this is a hilarious and gleefully funny film. But there was one thing that really bothered me about this film. The main characters do not share a real personality. They are extremely vain and uninterested in finding love. This leads to some very interesting twists, but they all have little to do with each other. Most of the major characters only seem to be around for a few minutes or a couple of minutes (at least) before disappearing into the background.|0
The Killing Yard is a great film , although uneven at times . Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort to do something that would be laughable in the age of high school kids.I can't recommend this movie enough. It's not for everyone and I don't understand why there aren't more Academy Award nominees being given to it. I remember reading this review from another reviewer. She had a good laugh about how he didn't know she was joking. He asked her out after dinner, and she started laughing as well!|0
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC, or any big city of mid-century America. The colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the Womens Movement. It reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. In some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. Inmy opinion, beautiful women will still THROW themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals!|1
then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man.|1
"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for ""Dr. David Ravell"" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of ""A Reason to Love"", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles."|1
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom.|1
This show is really great. It's smart.It's funny.It's great acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The Dialogues are really funny and well acted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.You really do believe they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.|1
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50 's , along with many others. If you liked this book it would be great if you bought the full edition or some other book which I haven't read yet. So far I have bought most of them, but some were good as well. It's probably one of those books that will keep me hooked for the rest of my life. For about half of this book there's a really interesting plot line that ends on ""the bad guy""."|0
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. If you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.This is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it.|1
"I 'm certain that people from USA do n't know anything about the rest of the world , but I don't think they would want anyone to know about America. If you haven't seen ""American Horror Story,"" please skip it. The story, like the rest of the films, is completely predictable. You have two main leads: a young woman (Jillian Dern) who loves her new partner (Haley Quaid) and an old friend (Margo Martell) who knows what's going on in New York City. In this film, the cast is as well-developed as usual."|0
I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading others' comments. They are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves.Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair.This movie is certainly worth your looking at.|1
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story  Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona  you predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure.|1
In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues making the documentary, discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama.|1
I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. It was so good that I couldn't really get out of my seat but I went at it anyway. You could tell it had not been made by somebody else. And yet, it's still here! The title of this book is to explain how to make a video game or movie based on the story of a man who loses his memory after he falls asleep while playing Tetris. There are many types of video games and movies.|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. So I gave it my best shot in the film so I could get my hands on it. I had to watch 2 hours of it when I came up with this script. What are some of the main plot twists that you must learn from the movie? There are five different types of characters in this movie. One of them is a beautiful, talented girl who falls in love with a man. Another one is a mysterious young man who doesn't like being alone.|0
"* * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * THE CELL / ( 2000 )
It was the year 2000, so when I got around to it my first thoughts were not good ones. Sure they were bad, but as a writer this is what you do when you don't really think about things and your expectations fall short of expectations.I started out thinking about the possibility that the film would be directed by a white girl in an African-American costume, who looks like a black woman. As I sat through the whole thing, I kept wondering if this was really happening."|0
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That being said, I think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. This is not the fault of the boys however. They even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption.|1
"It came before ""the ten commandments"" ""land of the Pharaohs"" ""Ben Hur"" and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel ,it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari,whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books ""the secret of the kingdom"" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land)."|1
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done.|1
Just watched Conrack for the first time . Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it has a very good premise. This is one of the few times I am willing to take on a film made in 1994 that did not sell well enough, because its premise was totally predictable, and the pacing was sloppy. The story wasn't very long, so I figured I'd just give it a try. If you have a budget for this, consider making an extra $25 to $30 for a DVD with subtitles or a CD.|0
Do n't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . This time it was about two men who get married in a hot bar to have sex with prostitutes. And I think there are good reasons why. First one, they're on drugs (or heroin) and drug dealing is bad for society. This movie wasn't supposed to go at all, but if you've seen it then you'll probably be surprised by some of its silliness. Most importantly, it didn't really give anyone an interesting story.|0
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western , given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social commentary (I guess this is how American life is in the 1980s. I'm sure there are other, more recent films on this list) into what you might call an old-school western. The main story was quite simple: a young Englishman discovers he's been kidnapped by alien abductees and is sent back to his native Earth as an agent for the US Government. As such, when it turns out he's wrong, he has to decide between leaving the US and fighting for his family again.|0
Most of these reviews are dead on, so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here.While the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. Here in the USA, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused.|1
"A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a 50's sense (which I love).The look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film ""Far from heaven"" reflects exactly this sort of film (and I suspect this film may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959! ), but as a film-- glorious!"|1
In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons , Elmer Fudd is out hunting , and Daffy tries to catch it. He then catches another bug (the one that's flying up his arm), and they're on a run through the countryside . The problem is, I've never seen any Bugs Bunny films that weren't really Bugs Bunny-themed. In particular, I'd like to see a movie in which the narrator doesn't want to actually have an encounter with the Bug; rather, he's afraid that he'll end up feeling guilty about his actions.The story itself is quite interesting.|0
"As a European , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 's. The story takes place in an area of the United Kingdom with a reputation for violence. However, that reputation has been somewhat tarnished since then when the British Empire was at its pinnacle. I'm not a fan of movies like this one (unless it's about revenge) and I don't really believe that they could be considered part of the ""American carnage."" The plot is rather predictable and the characters seem to have little regard for personal consequences."|0
I have n't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater , and I have been waiting patiently for the next movie ever to make me happy. This is one of the few movies I didn't want to watch because I did not know what was going through my head when they were made! I can't really explain what I saw on film like this. The cinematography is perfect, the performances are outstanding, and the storyline is absolutely riveting. Even if I hadn't seen it, I would have had to say that it would have made for an absolute masterpiece.|0
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I thought she should be on TV. She's not good at it. When I finally saw her again, she seemed even worse than before. I was a little upset that I couldn't see her again.I don't believe anyone who does anything remotely like her deserves to be punished for this crime. I bought this movie at the box office because I am sure there were many people who wanted more. The problem is, the only people who love this movie have to die and they do.|0
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic ""Alive"", there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director René Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film ""Supervivientes de los Andes"". The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers."|1
there 's only so much that i can take of Filipino films , especially nowadays where the trend is sex-swapping and gore/slasher (I am in love with it). There is a lot to say on this film. The director's voice sounds almost as if it was scripted by someone else. The acting is bad. The actors are not terribly interesting. None of them did anything particularly interesting. I'd be willing to give up one or two scenes for good measure. I have tried to read the original screenplay, but I can't because I've just finished my book.|0
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. The films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. One obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good.|1
"( My Synopsis ) Rae ( Christina Ricci ) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie on the couch, which is just not good. The script is a bit of a mess at best compared to what we actually get in this one. It starts out okay, but quickly gets boring after about 8 minutes when we hear ""I'm an adult"" from a young girl who comes out of nowhere and begins crying. Then things get worse, and her boyfriend becomes involved. I don't know if there has been a moment like that before, but she doesn't seem to care anymore."|0
"I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult . To say that is even worse than what I thought it to be is beyond words. The plot is completely over the top, there are lots of ""plot points"" made by characters who don't even know how to actually make sense of them or what their true intentions are. The only thing I noticed in this movie was how awful it was.If you read the reviews and think 'this isn't a great movie' then you have to get into the movie."|0
"This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger)is the lone ""acceptable"" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; ""looker"" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well."|1
"""Jaded"" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. This director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. The rape is brutal not sexual."|1
"I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including ` the young & the old` but I do not know who did it."" Some say this is funny, and some will say it is funny at first sight. I think this movie needs to go. After all, in the movies, there is always someone trying to pull it off, but when they take it out they have no idea what actually happens. The story was so long that it seemed impossible to tell anything about characters."|0
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance.|1
"This comment discusses ""North and South Book I"" dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen."|1
For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made. The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film.|1
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Renée Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.|1
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one . I really ca n't come to this one but i don't mind. The characters are decent and believable but it is the story itself which leaves me wondering if it can actually be told.This movie is a disappointment, you know? What kind of movies will get this kind of flick on your shelves in the 90's? No, seriously. This movie just does not make sense. The plot doesn't go very far with the main character. Why did he suddenly find his way into this movie ?|0
This film was made soon enough after Karen 's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen's life weren't even involved with it. This movie is one of the worst you can hope for. The script was written on a very cheap set, and there is no time to care about other details (I am pretty sure there would have been). I had a chance to try the film in person, but it didn't work out. The scene in front of me where I tried to open the theater doors was just plain ridiculous.|0
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!|1
The entire series , not just The Blue Planet , is nothing short of amazing . The best nature series, I could imagine (I'm pretty sure the other two are all great) but they're so dull that even if someone wanted to try and make them interesting, they would need to spend over an hour reading it in order for it to get any good results. The writing is very much a mess, which is a huge plus because it makes it seem like there might have been some sort of conspiracy behind what was happening.|0
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make me laugh or feel funny, I didn't think my own work was good enough. This is the best part about this game, it's basically the equivalent of playing a short film where you can have a bunch of fun. The story is very simple, but the action is not terribly interesting. There is really no substance to the characters, they seem like a bunch of guys who need each other.|0
` Skenbart ' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the whole genre. The cinematography is also very interesting and there isn't a lack of depth in this film either! There are scenes that don't sound too bad, like when they get shot, or where it's still hot and you need to turn off all the lights to see. It doesn't quite work though, which is an important point.Overall: 4/10 I think this film could have been made much better had it gone deeper.|0
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns : 'The Gunfighter ' by Henry King , and 'Wagon Rider ' by William Wyler . I was so confused as to be in disbelief at the sheer scope of what this film was about. It is probably worth mentioning that the title is derived from W. C. Fields's novel, ' The Battle of Stalingrad ', which has its own story-line. This film is also quite different from it's counterpart, 'Til Death Do Us Part ', in that it depicts the lives of several British soldiers who were killed or wounded during an attack on a Polish outpost.|0
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen is planning on having Cartman to be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff.|1
"There's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing God's work. Yeah right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump, and Freddy Krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. He is Jacob Goodnight(WWE's Glen ""KANE"" Jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a Axe, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. That is totally methodical! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head."|1
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.The plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good guy?I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it.|1
One of the biggest French success of the year 2002 , `` l'auberge espagnole '' was also very well greeted by the American press. That's what is so fascinating about being in France, but there is no way I have seen this movie without feeling a bit cheated out. This one isn't terribly bad, but some of the jokes are not exactly witty enough to work any sense into the story. The best thing you can say about this comedy is that it's pretty good and at times just downright awful.There's nothing special about this movie.|0
When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door , I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling . On the inside, and at the top of the stairs, there's this huge room. There's nothing else in sight except for a pile of bricks.I've always wondered what was the purpose of these bricks, but I soon learned that it was just to help them hold on to the rest of the blocks. It's so small, it feels like they'll slip through. They're so small you could easily put them in a bowl of spaghetti sauce if you were lucky.|0
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park . Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to make the show. I know I said this wasn't something you could find on The Onion but when you're talking about television it gets very boring as hell. It's an extremely well produced show with great characters, a lot of interesting scenes, and pretty good humor. However, what really surprised me was how shallow and superficial that whole thing was.It was one of those shows where the only reason you'll watch is if you've already seen them and haven't seen much else.|0
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie.|1
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is.|1
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.|1
America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do, therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.But it's obvious that its intention is not to present the America's next top model, but yes, the America's Next Pop Model.|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting.|1
"This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. I mean, it is an x-rated musical based on an actual book! There is a real plot to it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? This belongs in an exclusive short-list of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with ""pornographic movies"" these days is that it's all about the ""pornographic"" and not about the ""movie""."|1
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece . It 's Werner Herzog 's most unconventional film . It does n't have anything particularly memorable to it. There's nothing else I'd like to see in this film and no one has done more with his work than he does. I can tell you, from beginning to end, that I never understood what the hell this film was or where it came from. I thought maybe it was a combination of old-school European sci-fi and horror (or some combination). I don't know.|0
Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door Jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys try their best to locate Jimmy, meaning no more Jimmy if they get their hands on him.|1
`` Jaded '' should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure at all. I had a little fun playing with this movie. I can only remember one of its features that made me laugh out loud. As expected it has some funny moments. The plot takes place about two months in the future where Earth is invaded by the alien race, which are aliens that have captured and enslaved humans. This movie does not try to solve the original issue of how we got there; rather, it tries to make us feel more like characters.|0
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents house and got a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. The girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and TV shows, and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents.|1
