This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park . Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to  avoid following the strict instructions of his Grandma, who came for a surprise visit. However, his ruse quickly unravels when a neurologist and his gang find Cartman out and start chasing him around South Park. His wild ride comes to a crashing end when he learns to follow the instructions of his grandma, if only she stops adding red hot peppers to the recipe she just read off the internet. All in all, another fun-filled episode that reflects on what happens when kids test limits in unpredictable situations.|0

The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it?|1
This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be  a night he’d never forget. When he walked in the venue, he was mesmerized. Not just by the crowd of happy, vibrant people that had filled the room, but also by the countless memorabilia from old TV shows, iconic pop culture and actors from the hey-day of classic comedies that lined the walls. Everyone in the room was there for the same purpose, to laugh and make each other feel good about themselves.|0
"A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western , given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social  commentary and biker anthems

The new spin given to the movie added an intensity that would spark with interest in the classic old-fashioned western fan, and drew the eye of the masses. Characters ran away from the horrors of law enforcement with antihero escapades, leaping the sick and famished, fed and brewed by racism. Breaking boundaries and remixing racial judgements throughout the picture, you couldn't help but think that, underneath the bounty of catchy songs, bikeral piperies, and summerful photos."|0
"After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was damn well worth the wait! ""Rush in Rio"" may very well be the greatest rock DVD in existence. I'm not joking. It's incredible! All the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. I find it makes you feel like you're actually in Rio watching the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're actually there."|1
"I shot this movie . I am very proud of the film . It was a great experience which shows 

It also showed how great a team we can be when working together and pushing to achieve something larger than ourselves. My pride was immense when we finally saw the finished product. With the help of professionals and others working in the film industry we have produced something really great. My desire to create something beautiful has finally been realized and now it’s my mission to continue producing films with original ideas and strong emotions."|0
"I lack cable-vision and no longer have ""DirecTV"". So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes but not blonds, I of course not only have ""Barb Wire"", but I have ""Stripperella: The Complete First Season"". I've not yet found ""VIP"" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the ""Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding"" DVD. I have the issues of ""Playboy"" that Pamela Denise Anderson posed in. I could go on. I love Pamela!"|1
This is a `` revised '' Riverdance presentation , staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City . The acclaimed Irish dance show will include some changes in production , including a faster beat and changes to lighting and the song line up. However, classic Riverdance staples such as Irish tap dancing, colorful Irish costumes, mesmerizing precision moves and catchy traditional songs are all promised to keep audiences hooked. A step back in time as one of Ireland’s longest standing performance pieces shows Riverdance to continue in style and keep every performer captivating its audiences with beautiful music and Irish dance movements.|0
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this . I have  checked with my local video rental shops and video rental websites. I was not able to find the film or the video. I'm beginning to think that the film or the video might be out of circulation, or even not available for general public view. I've asked friends if anyone knows anything about this, or if anyone had copies of the film or video and nothing turned up so far. Perhaps if I had more leads or contacts it would help me.|0
First love . Teenage love . We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the  fairy tales. Sometimes it seemed so wonderful, but sometimes it ended in heartbreaking loss and betrayal. But even then, the memory remains sweet, still causing the butterflies in the stomach. It does not really matter how it turned out. One thing for sure, it’s our most remarkable childhood memory. I often smile looking back in retrospect and feel relieved it didn’t take anything more than that back then. Experiences can lead us forward even when there’s some negative involved in it.|0
"Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous  mission…

Young completes his mission, but feels he won't ever see the girl again. He continues to question whether or not she even reciprocates his affection, however she offers to find him after it is all done. As Peck had put Young in a tough position, he saw it was her kindness and love for him that broke Peck's resolve and for Young, his chance of happiness. Both Gregory Peck and Gig Young understand that no matter what, it is up to her."|0
`` Boy Next Door '' is a hilarious romp through male neurosis . In just over fifteen minutes , the  short offers an utterly insightful glimpse into how sometimes insecurity in relationships can both obscure as well as deepen connections between people . In many ways, this film embodies the sheer joy and sometimes awkward nature of new romance, finding fun in being seen in a way that other filmmakers rarely replicate. Rather than rushing straight towards traditional feelings and structure of a love story, the characters inhabit the nervous energy and bravado of the ever uncertain game of attraction.|0
"This was a pretty good episode . Though no `` Trapped in the Closet '' or `` Cartoon Wars ,  '' South Park used serious issues 

South Park proved why it has been running for so many seasons by tackling a complicated social issue in a unique manner, just like they do best. Stan and the other characters offer creative insights into race and how much progress has actually been made by a supposedly liberal and tolerant nation. This episode dealt with difficult issues of intolerance and misinterpretations between the police and minorities and shed a powerful light on modern racism."|0
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is.|1
"This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with."|1
"A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a 50's sense (which I love).The look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film ""Far from heaven"" reflects exactly this sort of film (and I suspect this film may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959! ), but as a film-- glorious!"|1
Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent.|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway).The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work.|1
This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ``  The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly'', one of his classic masterpieces. Romo Lauro, the legendary man of honour rides into town to get the overdue supplies from Lully Stanridge. As Stanridge wonders how the small Romo managed to do this, the clanging of hoof beats answer him as both gangs pour into the narrow street. Tempers start to flare, violence erupting on the street, then falls still as if in judgement when a woman shouts `` Shoot him !|0
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'The Gunfighter' by Henry King, and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. 'The Gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.However, I personally find 'Wagon Master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. Although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring.|1
"This is definitely an excellent show . I do n't have cable , so I started renting them , because 

I had heard so much good press and I was right! So far the episodes have had cliffhangers that have kept me wanting more. I just have to exercise my self-control to not binge watch them all at once. Thankfully I have had other activities and deadlines to keep me busy so I am doing just that. It is definitely a satisfying way to keep me preoccupied during these challenging times. Hopefully it can provide comfort and some distraction."|0
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.|1
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are  looking to buy. The traders proudly showed off their best stock and the Mormons saw their potential. After negotiating and finally agreeing to a price, the Mormons proudly set off with the new horses, impressed by the traders' performance. Everyone knew there were more business deals to be made and as the night progressed, more and more of the town's folks joined in to discuss different prices and evaluate more stock.|0
"I finally received my DVD today, viewed it and I'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of ""Rich and Famous"" that the edited for TV version of the film that somehow made it onto VHS sometime in the late 90's but, now WB has corrected the error and released it on DVD complete with the airplane restroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the Hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C**t!"|1
"I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch  everything

I'm glad I went to see the movie twice because there was so much to it that I couldn't fit into my memory in one go. There were great characters and lots of witty dialogue. It also had some fantastic and unexpected plot twists which added a nice bit of unpredictability. Seeing it again gave me time to savour all the humour as I paused to take it all in and ponder the complex story-line. I'll definitely be checking out similar films by the same director."|0
I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field.|1
"Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts , unlike many other great Ford films , like  The Searchers and Stagecoach

However, The Wagonmaster, like Ford’s other Westerns, can be interpreted differently by viewers. Its characters and morals echo messages Ford had told previously through his stories. Perhaps the movie isn't trying to make a statement or strike fear but instead send a humble message to us all - there’s always a small but important spot for individual ideas and independent will amidst harsh injustice and unpractical measures."|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time . I believe that if you just  watch an episode, you're sure to feel absolutely entertained. One of the many unique features about this show is its cast, which includes all sorts of wonderful, goofy characters that bring a touch of humor to each episode. Whether it is the clueless and hapless Sgt. Mainwaring, the adventurous, kind-hearted and overly polite Pte. Godfrey, the eccentric Capt. Mainwaring, or the book-loving but helpless Pte. Jones, they all contribute in some way to making the show something truly special and delightful.|0
"At first I could n't tell if it was an art film or a documentary . The day after I  looked at some of its awards, 

I decided that the film I watched had been nominated as a ‘Bester Art Documentary’ and realized it must be a combination of both. By using intense visuals and multiple view points from various characters in the movie, the filmmaker crafted a compelling film about modern culture and social activism. It presented a realistic perspective on life for a whole new generation, showcasing the day to day life in a compassionate manner."|0
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much . This is one of the best  shows I've seen in my life, as it has interesting characters, entertaining plots and dialogues that pull you in and keep you enthralled. I watch the miniseries often because it transports me to the world it portrays and lets me live through the experience along with the characters. This show helps me forget the troubles of life and fill it up with lots of exciting moments. Besides the episodes being excellent, it also offers deep insight into the depths of human experience which moves me a great deal.|0
"This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger)is the lone ""acceptable"" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; ""looker"" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well."|1
"Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script , good camera work and transitions , good directing 

RKO Saint has exceeded expectations in this offering, one that it would surely be difficult to match. The clever use of the location to enhance the storytelling really lifts this film, with exciting stunts. Scenes were timed very well with score blending in to continue momentum and continuity of emotions that carry the characters in the scene. Working together with the established cast and team at RKO to make it memorable on-screen action movie that pleases most."|0
Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off I went to discover more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy.|1
"I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out  of me

At first I didn't quite understand what I was watching but I do remember that I had goosebumps watching this movie. I don't think I could get to sleep the whole night since I was too scared of the evil character.I tried not to close my eyes too often in fear that he might suddenly come out of the movie and haunt me in my dreams. From then, I wouldn’t even look at a single poster of this movie."|0
"This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and ""man of the house"". It could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really?"|1
Sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. Splendid villains  you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one  both good and bad. Secondary story lines also are well developed. Several cameos by major stars of past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics.|1
"This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger , and I  never wanted it to stop 

I would often feel like Cinderella every time the movie played, it made me so excited! My sister and I used to have Cinderella dress-up days and imagine being like her. As an adult, I look back and remember these precious moments with such fondness and have recommended the movie to all my nieces and nephews. My heart smiles when I hear them recite the characters’ dialogue, sign the song’s melody, and become enchanted by Cinderella and the delightful and heart-warming scenes!"|0
This film had me spellbound this evening . Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted . John Voight , in a fitting role , adeptly shifted between fable and drama without compromising one for another. I loved the fairytale elements intertwined into a contemporary script - a skill which movie makers rarely master. Of all his awards, he deserves the Academy award for a special performance. The soundtrack blended well into the cinematography -especially that scene where John climbs a hill to meet his new employer. This well made classic keeps its promises until the end.|0
"I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it listed on the schedule at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, and I vowed I would make the 40 minute drive. The Stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When ""The Best of Everything"" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the New York City skyline, I knew I was right for waiting.I lapped this movie up."|1
The most beautiful film . If one is looking for serious depth , meaning and excellent performance then you have  come to the right place. From first time actors to big time celebs, all have perfectly combined to make a mesmerizing yet evergreen piece of art. There's something surreal yet captivating in the performances and especially when the visuals and the intense yet moving score meld together it is an experience not to be forgotten easily. Whether one talks about costume designs, art direction, settings, cinematography, none can deny the marvelous creation that this film is.|0
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak.|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations, including the Edgar Reitz office.|1
Awww, I love this! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon doesn't really need an synopsis, as that's what it is... the cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. It's the artistry that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year (2005)... yeah, almost same thing, which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off.But this is a really good short, with stark black & white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction...|1
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot . Bugs of Daffy . He 's unsure  about what decision to make. He contemplated their respective flaws, still unsure about whom to choose. Daffy has no knowledge or talent, whereas Bugs at least appears smart. Elmer is certain that Bugs can manipulate and would go out of his way to find a loophole for himself. However, Daffy is irritatingly comedic and always strives for attention. He wished he could go on a vacation, as it seemed his time off would help him decide.|0
Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big!|1
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am. My brother and I were channel surfing and who do we see but a young Russel Crowe. But not the telephone throwing Russel Crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. It stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to come across this film I would strongly suggest picking it up.|1
"I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V . and came across  a news story 

Suddenly, the headlines read that my hometown had been declared a warzone due to civil unrest. Panic surged through my veins as my heart raced with disbelief and fear. Reports from citizens gave chilling testimony to the magnitude of violence erupting through the streets. We heard firsthand accounts of unspeakable crimes, but the safety and well being of our friends and families weighed on our minds the most. All my friends were frantically searching for ways to reach home and desperately trying to connect with relatives living in the conflict-zone."|0
In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them.|1
"The four signs on the road say `` If You 're Looking For Fun ..... You Do n't Need A  Gun '

The four signs were like a compass guiding the path to find out what 's fun without carrying a gun. Finding adventure that doesn't put oneself or others at risk can create deeper meaning in life and we all can choose the path that brings out our individual joy. Life's too short not to take that leap of faith, follow these four signs, trust in them and know there will be surprises ahead that won't need violence."|0
"As I was reading through the comments , I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was  nothing but boring

After further investigation I found that this commenter had written this before actually watching the movie. It was based entirely off of other people's reviews, many of which expressed conflicting views. It seemed this particular comment was written before the person actually saw the movie themselves and had no intention of ever doing so. In my opinion, if one chooses to view a movie they should go in without pre-existing opinions. After all, opinions change!"|0
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual.|1
"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.The film only approximates Mika Walteri's ""The Egyptian"", in plot. A good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful!!! Performances as follows."|1
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture , 'Wagon Master ' made after two big Indian-cavalry  Battles. The picture featured Indian War chief Jeff Chandler and explored how human empathy could overcome racial and cultural differences. 'Wagon Master' proved to be a successful movie for John Ford as it earned two awards at Cannes. His representation of strong Native American protagonists also contributed to altering preconceived stereotypes of Native Americans during the mid 1950s. Consequently, 'Wagon Master' inspired the newly-minted Indian Uprising Productions, the first all-Indian run movie production studio.|0
This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert , and its influence on them is  profound. Mad Max came at a time where post-apocalyptic action movies were considered 'new'. It was at the forefront of Australia's maturing cinema scene and definitely deserved its success in introducing Australia's novel take on science-fiction. The film further explored post-apocalyptic themes which Priscilla and Road Warrior (1985) built on, paying tribute to a chaotic dystopian reality not familiar to Australians. It saw box office successes, especially internationally and paved the way for newer directors like George Miller to make their own entry into the sub-genre.|0
then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man.|1
"It has been recorded that John Ford made the `` big , blockbuster '' movies so that he could afford 

John Ford was the first Hollywood director to utilize big budgets to make popular movies on a grand scale. From popular westerns such as Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, The Searchers and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, to drama, comedy, biopic and musicals, Ford consistently drew a sizable and dedicated audience to the theatre. While others utilized wide angle vistas to depict a dynamic stage, Ford showed great knowledge and subtle techniques to accurately portray mood and emotion."|0
Fata Morgana is , by far , one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen  . The film is about a troubled couple that stays in an old abandoned palace during their honeymoon trip in Sicily. Things seem to become even more strange when one of them meets a ghostlike woman, whom they first believe is Fata Morgana - the one that appears in myths. Throughout the movie they stumble upon unexplained secrets, shadows, hallucinations and disembodied voices. All of it surrounds a culture that was built to show people's odd respect towards supernatural aspects of their culture.|0
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it.|1
Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her.|1
This movie makes you think . It shows how a woman 's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others . The film highlights how social environments shape and influence the choices we make in life. It raises important questions about how female characters can be manipulated and exploited by people around them who recognize and abuse their vulnerability. It reflects the fear of feeling powerless and disregarded, despite knowing that something wrong is occurring. It inspires critical reflection on the dilemmas faced by a modern society increasingly shaped by powerful emotions like guilt, loss and regrets.|0
When this film gets it right it really gets it right . And when it goes wrong ... I 'd  rather not even discuss it! The same can be said of any movie though and with this particular film it seems that it really depends on the mood of the viewer and what part of the plot is playing out on screen. Some people found the latter half to be slower and, although the theme was powerful, perhaps lost some momentum and punch with some viewers. Other scenes had jarring, expository conversations and complex jump cuts that made it less of a pleasant cinematic experience.|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish movie on cinema! Therefor, I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of thrill and humour is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea.|1
This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we groaned. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time!|1
`` L'Auberge Espagnole '' collected the audience wherever it was shown . It gathered audience awards on many film festivals  as it captured an unknown and indefinable atmosphere to millions. The warm critical reception made the movie and its message traveled further into the collective conscience and warmed up the hearts of many film goers. To this day, ''L'Auberge Espagnole '' continues to affect people around the world with its provocative exploration of themes, lifestyle choices and risk taking behaviour.

I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years . I rate it one  of the funniest sitcoms ever created. Since the series ended in 2007, there hasn't been another comedy quite like the King of Queens. Its clever writing and off-beat humour stand out to me as elements that make this series a must watch. The plots always evolve in such a clever manner, utilizing intelligent writing to help elevate the already entertaining and quirky story arcs. Many memorable characters, that help us gain further insight into Kevin's crazy household and job situations, aid in increasing the show's charm.|0
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain ( of course , because it 's so sensational  ) but there's much more to the film than that. The rest of the film also highlights the dehumanizing practices at some of the prison facilities and paints a fuller picture of this scandal. There's also much criticism for for-profit prison institutions where private ownership leads to inadequate spending and regulations. All in all, it looks like this film dives into this hot issue from every angle possible, sparking conversations to facilitate some much-needed reform.|0
I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic!|1
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It ranks right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. Today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances.|1
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002, ""l'auberge espagnole"" was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. This movie made by one of the most interesting French film-makers of these last years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students coming from all over Europe and gathered all together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life: either untidy, either serious or with a sense of humor."|1
"Style over substance. But what a style it is. ""The Cell"" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim."|1
"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. In their escape, the bandits split up. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. Three men have a different part of the ""clue"" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? Or, will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes  and outlooks that power many facets of America's national character today and our own past. USA The Movie is more than just a nostalgia piece; it serves to remind viewers of the culture of self-governance, principles, courage and optimism that inspired early Americans. By being intentional with an increasingly fractured nation's dialogue, we can both remind others and educate ourselves of these values, often shrouded in murky and concealed judgement.|0
I couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.|1
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role as Williams for that entire show, was Emmy worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is....WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes.|1
This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is wicked great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is terrific as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch.|1
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film.|1
I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, nor, Richard for that matter, so I must go by how the movie portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I did see and learn of Karen, I felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. I know that I wasn't born until 1965 so I didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music.|1
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; ""We're Men in tights!"""|1
The first time I saw `` Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy '' , was in the early  90s. I was unsure at first but eager to know what the show was about. The reviews I'd read were impressive and it exceeded my expectations. The play was wild, imaginative and even had adults joining in the chorus.The musical was incredibly campy with fabulous choreography, laughter throughout the theater, catchy music and awesome special effects. The experience changed me for the better. It was unlike anything I had seen before and I learned to embrace what felt out of my comfort zone.|0

The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial . The films that featured their brood paved the  way for TV families such as The Bradys, The Osbornes, The Simpsons, and the characters found on Stranger Things. In the 70 years since the Kettle movies were made, the legacy of the character has permeated our cultural awareness and their spirit is an endless source of humour. With more than 70-year's of existing and deepening rich comedic history, Ma & Pa Kettle has ensured their cultural spot as staples of physical comedy.|0
I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock ànd renée zellweger.|1
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield. The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named Brian Foster whose systems at his boss's company seems to keep failing, Brian is also dating the boss's daughter named Casey. But Brian secretly invented a robotic dog named CHOMPS, modeled after his own dog Rascal. But CHOMPS is no ordinarily dog, he is as fast as a cheetah, he has x-ray vision, can leap about 6 feet, and has a strength of 20 men. The new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success.|1
Ignore the bad reviews on here , this film is awesome ! `` Just Before Dawn '' is a great  supernatural horror film set in a summer camp with a tragic story and one twist in the end that make you think twice.The film follows a group of six teenagers spending their holiday at the remote site in the rural forest with astonishing scenes of green nature that come to life in harmony with its horrific elements. The psychological pressure raises quickly as soon as the protagonists get isolated in their own solitude and as we’ll gradually see as things develop, and tensions start escalating between them, anything can be suspicious and mysterious.|0
I saw it in Europe-plex . Great movie ! ! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the  search for meaning in life. The beautiful cinematography and imagery is supported by a sweeping musical score, that serves to evoke feelings of hope and resilience in its audience. The narrative carries with it an aura of tranquillity, grace and thoughtful contemplation that invites you to become part of the characters and their journey. As a viewer I felt genuinely moved and in awe at times. This experience has become the backbone to what my new definition of spirituality is and remains my one of my favorites films of all time.|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enraptured in Orry and Madenline's love story. I am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie.|1
"""Boy Next Door"" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. If you thought all he could do was play ""Bull"" the bailiff on ""Night Court"", think again."|1
"I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule 

To my surprise, it was an incredible movie and far exceeded my expectations. It had plenty of intense action sequences, plenty of comedic moments, and great acting. There was never a dull moment and the cinematography was on point. This made for an engaging and enjoyable experience, it even had a surprising twist I did not anticipate. When the credits rolled, everyone around me was ecstatic about the movie and left the theater feeling very satisfied."|0
"Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys , but providing a  window into their struggles

He reminded us that the physical abilities required for this work of discipline and labor had no prejudice when selecting recipients. We gained insight into a chapter of history often neglected by larger books in grade schools throughout America, making for a feeling of triumph over a sense of exclusion. Many remember Mario Van Peebles as the father in a revolution, offering invaluable information and creating awareness in regard to historical facts involving people of color."|0
Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party.|1
"In Crystal City , a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis ( Ben Johnson ) and Sandy (  Harry Dean Stanton )

The two men team up for their travels and stumble across the ravages of nature as well as wild natives as they get further and further into this primitive unknown land. The chance for adventure helps drive them on as does the job to help rebuild Crystal City and unite it with Salt Lake City and with this mission Travis and Sandy drive harder and battle harder against the waves of risks that come with venturing deep into wilderness."|0
First of all - I 'm not one to go all sappy over movies . I saw Friends in the  park and had some fun. After watching it I really enjoyed the comedic take it had on different situations throughout the film. The witty script and endearing cast was remarkable and it actually left me with a great impression overall. It was a story that tugged on all kinds of emotion, mainly leaving me with this feeling of optimism. Although the romantic moments and wholesome vibes all blended together seamlessly it had a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor which I thought was brilliantly clever.|0
John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'Wagon Master' made after two big Indian-cavalry epics... It is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... It didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...Photographically, it is extremely simple... The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons...|1
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). However, the principal acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress ""Nefer""."|1
This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe . Notice how some of the Roman sets  were reused as an ancient Persian architecture? In King of Kings, Fox maximized their Cinemascope potential by shooting extravagant scenes of parades, executions, and demonstrations. Although this narrative brings us through various spectacles of Biblical Biblical plots and history, we feel just as enamoured when we get glimpses of stunning epic location shots. To accommodate this scale and imagery, director Nicholas Ray’s budget spiraled to the tens of millions; luckily the marvels of Cinemascope drew more people in during a highly competitive entertainment age.|0
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it.|1
"I did n't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn . I do n't know why I keep buying  tickets

However, when I saw it, I was incredibly impressed with the way they used limited settings and filmed a naturalistic horror. They successfully portrayed the complex dynamics between people in claustrophobic situations, keeping me glued to my seat until the ending credits rolled.The soundtracks added great intensity to the creepy and chilling environment that the main characters encountered. The clever storytelling combined with impeccable visuals gave me an unforgettable cinema experience. It exceeded my expectations and for sure, it will be one of my favorite horror movies of all time."|0

However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold.|1
"An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in Bogotá, you can feel the total meaning of the word ""Bluff""(although is a Colombian film, the title is in presented in English); ! The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who find his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; after this Nicolas is left without girlfriend and without any job."|1
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds or so.So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content.|1
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission , I can only look at this as a  set of formal dialogues between victim and perpetrator.It will aim to investigate, educate, remember and help both parties reconcile with the difficult past that is still pervasive today. This can be done through restorative and symbolic methods such as helping with reparation, facilitating communal gatherings and restoring collective spaces. It is a way of reckoning with a history of hurt and deep emotional scarring. Every step taken is a step towards achieving not only emotional healing but the important goal of bringing people closer together.|0
I'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. All who love this movie should email Disney and increase the demand for it. They'd eventually have to sell it then. I'd buy copies for everybody I know. Everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and I haven't figured out why Disney hasn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. The kids in the new generation don't get to see it and I think they should.|1
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be British, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. Not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended.|1
"I played Sam ( the porter , Lou 's sidekick ) in the Film `` Dead Rail '' Which later  screened at the 2008 Sydney Film Festival

Playing Sam in Dead Rail was an eye-opener to me. After the Sydney Film Festival, many reviewers started calling it “A a sensational new slacker adventure set on and around Australia’s only ‘conversation café’ in Port Adelaide. It gave me a new impetus to my life. Audience appreciation was overwhelming, that film was bigger than the films stars that occupied the crowd."|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. Central to the story is Xavier ( Romain Duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. He learns about life and love rapidly. Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. The rest of the cast also play well.|1
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well.All too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre.|1
I LOVE this movie. and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where I can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. All these Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring.|1
I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went back many more times to see it over and over ... I think 9 times in all. Just great is how I would describe it ... I was taken by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the life style the kids began on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had set up ... of course the powers that be have to intercede, but when I forget that part I find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that!|1
I lack cable-vision and no longer have `` DirecTV '' . So being a rural resident I have to wait  for the age of streaming to become more in mainstream here. Luckily, that day appears to be slowly approaching, with new technology providing access to fast Internet in some parts of the country. It is definitely something I look forward to as streaming seems like a much more modern and reliable option. Beyond just being able to watch my favorite shows, faster Internet is a must in my part of the country if it ever hopes to really modernize and stay connected.|0
* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it  in an odd way.The premise of the story was really surprising and different compared to the typical themes we find in other films.It took me on an unexpected journey full of entertaining scenes and characters.I loved how creative the plot was, it kept me on the edge of my seat as I didn't know what would happen next.Overall, the movie was interesting, funny, and daring.I have never seen anything like it before, it really stands out amongst the dozens of cookie-cutter movies that line the store shelves.|0
"In dramatising Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route."|1
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I didn't have great taste back then (not to say that I do now) so I can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, worth watching. I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash.|1
See No Evil With Kane. The Movie Has a great storyline But it just wasn't a Hide my eye's, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it was going to be from watching the WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw When The Movie First Came To Theaters. I Did ENJOY The Movie Though I Loved The Story It Played Out.GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 It Doesn't Matter If Kane Gets Killed At The EndOr Not They Have Killed Off Other Horror Stars In Every Movie They Have Out And They Still Comeback For More So a part 2 wouldBe Very Interesting.|1
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies , along with Spaceballs ( although I will openly admit  to enjoying some of his other stuff ). From Young Frankenstein to the iconic and Oscar-nominated The Producers, Mel Brooks has made numerous genre-defying hits throughout his lifetime. Along with comedies, Mel Brooks has directed classic western and silent movies such as Blazing Saddles and the largely acclaimed Dr. Strangelove respectively. Although I will state his recent additions may not be as excellent as earlier ones, it's admirable to see him stretching and adapting as he continues working even now.|0
Absolutely , I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting , fascinating and certainly beautiful film  . The sheer splendor of its cinematography lends to a journey filled with mystery , unexpected tension , and overwhelming emotion that prove wholly satisfying. It immerses viewers in this mysterious realm as various conflicting interests - inter-societal dynamics and clan rivalries come to light in brilliant cinematographic sequences and make for one spellbinding , soul-stirring affair. The moving images scattered throughout capture both breathtaking beauty and power like only an extraordinary master craftsman could wield , showcasing both their trust in the powerful combination of originality and the impact it can bring to viewers.|0
"After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I  went to the store and after some search,

I finally found the film ""Buttercup for Degeneration"". This film also stars Christopher Bliss and Sharon Spicer. I bought the film and couldn't wait to watch it! When I did, I was surprised to find it filled with beautiful scenery and funny situations, it was entertaining and sweet. The entire time, Meredith stole the show. She played the lead female with wit and courage."|0
I haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and I have been searching for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the ending eludes me. It was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run.|1
For my money , probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford  ever made is 'The Searchers'. I particularly love his use of extremely complex backdrops and closeup to build up the western story arc. Through that his use of both inversion and rescripting had almost epic dimension, breathing freshness and realistic momentum. Also worth mentioning, John Wayne portrays Ethan Edwards an and lead actor could give such force to screen in this film and the delicate makeup helps visualize the tense among each members of Edwards’.|0
I was drawn to `` Friends '' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous  composer called. The catchy, dynamic melodies sung by emerging singers and playful background melodies are part of why the show remains so beloved to this day. It is part of what brings such unique personality to the show that it is remembered for. Beyond just the catchy tunes, it also reflected the adolescent experiences of the characters by using unique instrumentation. Quirky combinations like tin whistle, piano and guitar, zylophones and bass came together to bring more texture to the soundscape.|0
"""Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!"" ""Can you play dead?"" It's difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime dramedy. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's perfectly awful one-liners. Cracking out such gems as ""Adios, Blimp,"" Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch."|1
"I saw the Messiah : - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes  I had seen on television

It is hard to miss that the messiah delivered on the ideas it claimed, weaving together plot threads from different plot points, across nationalities and peoples. The complex relationships between characters and emotions they felt was portrayed in a sensitive manner and woven well throughout the programme. Moreover, with compelling set designs and pacing that always felt compelling, viewers were taken to depths of plot unthought of before."|0
This one started excellently. The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious.|1
"I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release . It is a delightfully cute  dog story

Afterwards I followed Chomps through its further journey, mostly via the internet and various kinds of media. Surprisingly enough I learned about more stories about Chomps and his ever increasing fanbase. Over the span of its one week run, Chomps gained tremendous traction on Youtube and Facebook, emerging from a dog that few knew of, to a minor but upcoming movie icon. Thousands of people posted their photos with Chomps in various poses on social media."|0
Based on Mika Waltari's Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.The Plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording,But all in all it has a strong social content:Man is ruled by his emotions,and that every action has an equal consequence.But to truly enjoy this film,First see the movie,then read the book.Although different,it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen,and gives breath to some more of the depth of Sinuhe.|1
"After ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type."|1
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord!|1
It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of `` slasher '' movies in the early 1980 's ,  Horror films became stale, uninspired and dull. Despite the inevitable tiredness that followed the wave of Slasher films, the genres has kept audiences excited with ongoing periods of creativity and innovation. By weaving in aspects from other film genres, and more abstract storytelling approaches, the films brought audiences both novelty and fear. Each wave of films tends to tell relevant, socially conscious stories in increasingly imaginative, and darker, ways, culminating in recent critical and popular success films such as 'Get Out'.|0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to Underground. It deserves strong love. It is an insane game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even though graphics suck, thats doesn't make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES?|1
"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for ""Dr. David Ravell"" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of ""A Reason to Love"", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles."|1
"I have n't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater , and I have been 

itching to watch it again. For a long time it was unavailable, so it's really nice to see that it has made its way back onto streaming platforms. Last weekend, I stayed up all night binge-watching it, my palms slick with anticipation. The special effects were even better than I remembered and I just couldn't get enough! I'm so relieved I can enjoy this movie in the comfort of my own home once more, just as much as I did all those years ago in the drive in."|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through . It has a great ensemble of characters ,  both male and female , who seamlessly bring together a spectacular story. The storyline of Nurse Betty follows a unique blend of drama and comedy with amazing twists and turns. As Betty's personal life comes in more clarity, it becomes quite evident that life itself is very hard and one needs a certain inner strength to make their life peaceful and loving. From the characters' first encounter with Betty to the rollercoaster ending of her relationship with the older fiance, each emotion becomes tangible and relatable.|0
Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama.|1
I have been a `` huge '' rush fan ever since `` moving pictures '' and this concert is simply  awesome. The energy of the crowd and the tremendous enthusiasm for every single song had an amazing impact on me. Seeing them playing every hit song live is such an amazing feeling that is hard to explain. I got the opportunity to experience one of the most beautiful nights of my life and the Rush legend at its best! Their exemplary energy and magnificient performance just got the crowd wild and had me standing still in awe of them.|0
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.The plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good guy?I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it.|1
First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70's when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home.|1
One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wish it had told us more. I have read many biographies and seen other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control.|1
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious Camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians.|1
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound affect on me then. I saw in again about a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. This is a great movie that personifies the struggle of ""principle vs. pragmistism"". Voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change."|1
"I 've seen 'nurse betty ' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea '  

Both screenings of Nurse Betty proved to be rather emotional for me and other audience members alike, who genuinely admired this outstanding masterpiece and all its aspects. We held our applause until the very end in amazement, followed by a vibrant discussion between everyone who witnessed it. However, this isn't just another picture that fades away quickly after being watched - we continue to praise it even today, that's why it isn't rare to stumble upon spontaneous lines regarding this movie when hanging out with friends."|0
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. The costumes are great, the story lines are great, I love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. There is a great balance of good and evil. Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch.|1
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.The trailer of ""Nasaan ka man"" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role."|1
This show is my absolute favorite . This show is intelligent , entertaining and always full of surprises . Lauren  Dern does an excellent job portraying her character as she is completely convincing. This show also features a stellar ensemble cast including Priyanka Chopra and Reese Witherspoon. Each character brings something unique to the story making it impossible to stop watching. The relationship between the characters makes it feel so real and so compelling, every interaction a complete pleasure to behold. Furthermore, each season goes to greater depth and creates richer stories. All this culminates to a powerful and moving narrative with heartfelt and sometimes profound lessons about life.|0
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 . Now the daughter is  all grown up and struggling to find her own way. They face issues just like any other family. They grow, change, fight, and then learn how to put the past aside to move forward with the right outlook on the future. It follows their triumphs and struggles through work and family, education and friendship, which often reinforces the life lesson to persevere, no matter the circumstance. It tackles social problems like insecurities and explores themes such as maturity, decisions, forgiveness, reconciliation and parenthood.|0
"I really like this show . It has drama , romance , and comedy all rolled into one . I  think the reason this show is so successful is that the stories they tell relate to life in so many different ways. People can watch an episode and think ""That’s me! "", or, “That could be me"". As well as relatable situations, it’s a show that provides emotional connections with its viewers and transports them into another world where happiness is tangible and stories live forever."|0
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more killings and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice.|1
"I LOVE this movie . and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore . I think they should  bring back this amazing movie 

The 90s kids, like myself, knew the value of watching such amazing movie every single time. With ever such legendary actors and an uplifting storyline, this movie was considered one of the few Disney movie where they took a different yet meaningful stand. All we want Disney is to give back to the 90s kids an movie with this uniqueness in it and stop depriving them of its soulful existence. Such effortless strides make all the difference for millions of their viewers around the world."|0
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. A true, polished, diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character ""Conrack"") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. At first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home."|1
"Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect . Here Alice is a  private eye, no longer

Alice as an adult finds herself surrounded by a plethora of familiar characters, who not only manage to uncover dark and sinister mysteries from her own past but also close unresolved cases from her more adolescent days. From her illegal incarceration to confronting the most abhorrent betrayals, Alice acquits herself masterfully despite all obstacles and shocking revelations. At times she hesitates and discovers herself against an extraordinary yet intimidating atmosphere."|0
"`` Stripperella '' is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones ( voiced by Pamela Anderson ) who  is secretly Stripperella,

Stripperella is a formidable warrior by night, using her superpowers of enhanced agility, strength and hyper-sensuality. She uses her powers to save the world from ne'er-do-wells like NoWorld Moneybags, Exploitive Trust Oftenscum, Pulpo Labrax, Electric Ampola, Digmata Destructoid and Blotto Bulknutrition. The show mixes live-action and animated sequences together, featuring special guests including Ron Jeremy and Steven Seagal, and notable episodes such as an animated installment with Debbie Harry, in which Erotica uses her full sexy Stripperella side to get information from gangster informants."|0
"It 's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it 's either  5 or 1 stars

Most people either love the movie or hate it. There was a mix of opinions among my friends as well - some thought it was one of the greatest movies they ever watched and others simply couldn't sit through it. Me, personally, I didn't regret it even though it could've been more action packed, more unpredictable. I had fun and that's the only thing that matters."|0
"Graphics is far from the best part of the game . This is the number one best TH game in  the series

In terms of storyline and engaging quests, this TH game undoubtedly lives up to the expectations. In addition, it boasts interesting characters, an in-depth open world with beautiful environments, an engaging soundtrack, improved combat and several innovative crafting techniques. Even better, each of the game's companions and side characters offer dynamic play experience which results in multiple playthroughs and undemanding narrative playthrough. All this contributes to creating a truly dynamic TH game experience and stands out amongst the rest of the games in the series."|0
"One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford 's best in my opinion . No major stars ,  the narrative circles a much worn plot: revenge

""Fort Apache"". Centered around John Wayne's character, Lt.Colonel Thursday and Henry Fonda's character, Captain Yorke; it traces a mutinous sub plot set on a lonely isolated out post in the apaches'. It delves deep into a plot which is dealt out of line, issue orders one without insight and knowledge of the people, reinforcing various dangerous responses. He realizes much later that a different tack can unravel situations in the fragile ‘internal borders of your community."|0
"If I 'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty , I probably would n't have touched it with a  10 foot pole

I never knew the genre of dark-comedy drama, so the title only brought a raised eyebrow at first. Nonetheless, it slowly crept under my skin with reviews ranging from all across the board, highly curious by what this small production has been able to assemble. After being exposed to some spectacular trailers, my jaw dropped with just how remarkable the subject matter looks! For every caution that initially registered I believe was met with some marvelous sequences I truly just had to savor."|0
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. I think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.There are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than USA T.M., I'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't.|1
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen is planning on having Cartman to be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff.|1
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native Italy. His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.)|1
What can you possibly say ? This is the uncut hardcore , musical Alice ! It works too with a  comic or maybe weird Alice-based tricks and traditional off-beat tunes. Alice certainly loves to challenge what we believe about what Alice is. She refuses to stay inside the frame of any 'Alice' pre-conception and instead actively attempts to deconstruct what it means to be Alice and to just be oneself through her songs. She tests us by mixing of strong personalities through weird Alice based lyrical combinations, waltzes and quirky funk. We always love and celebrate Alice's wild and brave journey!|0
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. To have it totally wash over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is at once forbidding, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies within!|1
Most of these reviews are dead on, so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here.While the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. Here in the USA, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused.|1
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values , but very surface  story telling

The musical soundtrack combines contemporary rock songs, classical arrangements and modern world instruments, adding a well-crafted and thought out overall balance of song types. Some of the larger tracks transport us to fantasy worlds or the multi-cultural throngs of a colourful urban world. Other more subtle back-story tracks gracefully underscore the entire proceedings. Each track engages emotionally and emotionally blends the storyline, sometimes offering uplifting colours during sad moments, or calm solo performances during action scenes."|0
"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for."|1
This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. It is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship.|1
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school  football game against the odds. He begrudgingly commits to play and soon finds himself finding value in hard work and discipline. His bad attitude slowly begins to fade away and is replaced by an entirely different mindset; one that his teammates immediately appreciate. He embraces being a role model and brings a fiery competitive spirit to the game. He plays the best football of his career and with great poise leads his team to victory, unifying his school community in the process.|0
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: ""Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose."" Inside the prison, the first sign we see is ""Welcome: have a seat."" They then show an electric chair.Corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it!"|1
"Pat Conroy's autobiographical book ""The Water Is Wide"" proves to be something of a Southern ""Up The Down Staircase"", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, ""Conrack"" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. The one actual actress in the bunch (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the ""tough nut"" Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze."|1
I'm certain that people from USA don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the USA. The only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the USA and Islamic nations. In France, for instance, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it's 14. In Spain it's 12. So the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal.|1
"It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about . Or , maybe  even define it

Defining Fata Morgana may not be a simple task, because its source material—such as dreams, visions, myths, superstition, magical worlds and human consciousness—comes together to shape an allegory. In this story, mysterious, invisible shapes challenge the realm of physical reality, suggest realms that border on both fantasy and truth and test notions of knowledge. But perhaps its underlying idea is that however perfect and certain something may appear, as a vision, anything tangible can easily be just an illusion."|0
"THE CELL ( 2000 ) Rating : 8/10The Cell , like Antz , must be watched twice to be appreciated  fully. Although slightly surreal in parts , it never strays far enough away to lose your focus. It follows Carl, a

When the story develops, and slowly twists and turns, we follow his exploits as he goes undercover to get the full scoop. His espionage story isn’t enough on its own though as the appearance of mysterious charector of Persophone pushes the storyline to thrilling lengths. Her involvement includes dreaming deeply and discovering herself amidst a strange entanglement of sexuality and self-discovery."|0
"Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make  excuses about every remark that a woman uttered, she expected 

when she entered a higher position to encounter sexism and outright chauvinism, but surprisingly was welcomed with nothing but respect and understanding. Having brought out the best in her work-force, each team member pushing their limits, in collaboration to bring great success to the business. Her eyes and ears on the ground provided information that the bosses really should have known themselves. Thanks to her wisdom, advice, and clever thinking the workplace has thrived."|0
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford 's work . Mainly because it 's the only one  to offer such an amiable and pleasing, carefree tone. The audience is offered an episodic view of three travelers searching for a paradise . As their search leads them towards a closer relation with some men that think that civilization should not extend much further than it does, a distinct resistance to expanding society can be felt. The spirit of Wagon Master and its themes of acceptance and enjoyment is incredibly uplifting. Its distinct amiable humour amidst their careful journey can even brighten any bitter-sweet times.|0
I 'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film . If you  ask me the performances from both leads were fantastic . Many critics are claiming it is cliché and the plot is quite generic. Although this may be true for some people, the end of the movie held many twists and surprises that I did not expect. It is definitely worth a watch! Even more enjoyable with a friend so you can discuss and compare interpretations of the story and characters. As an avid filmgoer, I believe this movie was truly great.|0
"I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary , it is obviously a labor of  love

The filmmaker’s genuine commitment to justice and equity shows throughout this amazing production. It examines pressing social, racial and political issues with unflinching clarity and exposes difficult conversations. From passionate interviews to compelling storytelling and bold visuals, the film places diverse issues firmly into the spotlight and lays the foundation for something profound and life-changing. I felt a sense of duty to respond and drive greater conversations. There’s no doubt that this is an urgent film for our times and encourages greater recognition, activism and reform."|0
Do n't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . This time  around, director Jaap Jukeleweijn gave a well intentioned and soulful homage to this cherished work of literature. The well choreographed scene does it a justice with eloquent lines, layered interpretation of characters. However, as with all adaptations, there's always that apprehension of oversimplification or loss of essential elements from the novel. While Jukeleweijn remains largely loyal to the storyline of Austen, certain subtle changes of narrative definitely skew it away from its true original intent.|0
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.Despite incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners.Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him.|1
This was an excellent show . It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron ( En Vogue) making an appearance. I enjoyed the banter between all of the panelists. Especially after a long day at work it was the perfect way to decompress and the best part, I never knew who would win each round. I loved hearing my peers critiques and observations of the panels debating which ultimately could easily bring a myriad of passions. You see there would always be laughter or passionate controversy which really enhanced the suspenseful vibe of the program.|0
Well ..... I would n't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I  really believe. We all have to be able to live with ourselves and so whatever choices we make, we need to be comfortable that they are moral, responsible, ethical choices and will lead to the happiness of others. A lot of us make excuses as to why we do or don't do something when deep down, we just don't have the courage to follow through. Learning to choose between right and wrong can sometimes be very difficult but also equally necessary.|0
"The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over  them

That caused a wave of terror and astonishment as everybody saw her expression on her face. Just as Alan went to cut her knickers, suddenly his Mom appeared from behind. He quickly tucked away his razor in his pocket and attempted to explain his act as playing pranks with friends. Her mom grabbed the scruff of his neck in fury and the gathered crowd disappeared away. All that left the protagonist ashamed and humbled."|0
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted ""naturally"" and you ""felt"" for them in the respective roles. A ""glossy"" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January, 2005."|1
If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie.|1
"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin."|1
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a  divine plan. Aparnaji has proven that success has nothing to do with talent alone but that dedication, resilience and creativity are paramount. She has found strength and direction through hard work and courage. We must use Aparnaji as an example and take up any obstacle as an opportunity to strive higher in our endeavours. She inspires us all to never give up on our dreams. Whatever her circumstances, she was determined to prove that success was attainable for her.|0
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?The answer become less clear as the film goes on.Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.Chris Rock  though as foul-mouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as Wesley.|1
I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it! !If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.|1
spoiler -- In 1993 , African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City  with the groundbreaking drama,Posse. The cast was primarily comprised of Black actors, some of whom, such as Treach and Billy Zane, gained great success after this iconic film. Much of the filming occurred in Mexico, as an unlikely sight of places rarely presented on the silver screen and bringing black excellence, relationships, heritage and spirit to the wilderness frontier. In many ways, Posse formed a distinct impression upon the direction of action films for both the genre and for people of colour.|0
This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of `` Rawhide '' Charles Marquis Warren . The script follows Clay O'Meara as he travels back to his former small town and reflects on his personal history there. Soon enough he runs into trouble with locals who don't welcome strangers in their land. This flick expertly straddles between subtle symbolism, grand visual set pieces and explosions of dynamic gunplay, culminating in a fateful shootout. At its heart, it's a western examining human condition - failure of memory and failed search for identity.|0
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song."|1
"It came before ""the ten commandments"" ""land of the Pharaohs"" ""Ben Hur"" and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel ,it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari,whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books ""the secret of the kingdom"" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land)."|1
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. If you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.This is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it.|1
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. The musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it throughly!! I was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and was blown away. I have not missed a show since power windows and I have to say that they are better than ever.|1
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond.|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain).|1
My kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with.|1
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.'|1
I couldn't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips.|1
America 's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense . It has a great hostess ,  it focuses on very realistic yet engaging conflicts , and it offers beautiful shots .

I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie . How surprised I was ! This is a  fantastic masterpiece! I didn't think I would end up so pleased and excited. With some of the most captivating music and memorable cinematography, this movie keeps me excited and fully involved in the entire plot. Even though it can take an emotional toll from time to time, it provides the necessary laughs at all times. On top of it, I have learned so much about the topic of the movie and couldn’t help myself appreciate the small details throughout the plot.|0
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job Mr. Lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! Though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! Overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars!|1
"This twisted comedy is well acted and directed . Very funny and the production quality is outstanding . It is  a story of one families misadventures and loves, that plays out much like a movie 

The story carries across several generations and encompasses themes like success, power and a moral dichotomy of dark and light. Throughout, there is also a strong air of bittersweetness that lingers as the characters go through laughter, pain and chaos. It’s a witty piece of writing and all that combine with humour and human observations, forming a subtle and sure bond with the viewer."|0
If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.|1
Hmm , is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar 's post Saved By The Bell acting ? Yes, it's perfectly fine to compare their acting. Since they both starred in the same TV show, it is only natural to make this comparison. Both Thiessen and Gosselaar played such dynamic characters, embodying both highs and lows as characters such as Kelly Kapowski and Zack Morris. As both went their separate ways post SBTB, their projects display clear variation in acting style. Their craft for making dialogue their own helped Saved By The Bell soar and secured a long lasting impact in pop culture.|0
"You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a ""story."" At first viewing, it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images."|1
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say ""french culture"". I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) My french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!"|1
this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for Gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love Sookie St. James!|1
"This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photography is notably confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love ""Oz"". The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. That similarity suggests that ""Oz"" was far ahead of its time."|1
"I just started watching The Show around July . I found it by mistake , I was channel surfing during  lunch

The Show instantly grabbed my attention. The blend of dark humor, drama, mystery and wit intrigued me. The twists and turns made me absolutely hooked! Each episode managed to keep my full attention for hours. Every day I would rush to get home to keep up with all the developments in the series. I ended up finished all the seasons of The Show during those July weeks, though watching the end did not mean it ended for me as I couldn't wait to start all over again."|0
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter 's complex life . Though it fails in  some points to provide full truth, the short bio shows how successful and influential Karen Carpenter has been to generations of music lovers. Karen Carpenter is widely regarded as one of the greatest singers of her time, her talent widely reaching beyond generations of her era. The singer found immense fame as the voice of duo “The Carpenters” which rocketed their albums to be some of the best-selling albums of the era. Her relationship with fellow band-member and brother, Richard, unfortunately strained as time passed.|0
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim ( Richard Barthelmess ) who has one bad flight in  which his aeroplane narrowly avoided hitting a tower. Since then Jim was overcome with anxiety, leaving him afraid to fly, but never actually facing the root cause of why he felt the way he did. The town's citizens took matters into their own hands, setting up a radio relay tower that's in perfect working order, so Jim could rely on to make his navigation on his next mission. Upon take-off, Jim succesfully flies into the sky.|0
This show is really great . It 's smart.It 's funny.It 's great acting and writing . This show is  full of important social themes as well . In particular , the issues of family , friendships , self worth and identity . By intertwining each of these with timely plotlines the show reflects contemporary topics often facing the modern generation. Furthermore, the dynamics between each of the characters add further nuances that inspire lively debates and further individual character analyses, often reflecting society’s current dialogue. It gives us more reasons to think and explore new ideas .Overall , this show serves as great form of entertaining escape for its viewers.|0
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it.|1
"I finally received my DVD today , viewed it and I 'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical  version 

It was quite different compared to the censored version which had circulated on TV, and my copy was officially labelled ‘extended cut’. I was so excited to watch as I've waited so long and it definitely paid off! I wasn’t left with disappointment as every aspect from start to end had me enthralled. From the breathtaking sets, extraordinary performance and nail biting climax; I knew for certain that I was contented with the purchase."|0
"This was on odd film . I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children 

I found the story interesting, even with its abundance of make-believe characters and talking animals. I think what stood out the most for me was the storyline - with plenty of mystery and some humour in there. As the characters unravel the underlying message and weave the plots, you will feel enchanted. In the end it comes down to some friendly banter and happy lessons that can be taught to all of us. Even for adults this movie is quite magical, with some nuances that are full of laughs."|0
Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the stock company out into the Utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are being shown the exit.|1
This comment discusses `` North and South Book I '' dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA  and the Civil War played a huge role in changing the country, but North and South Book I delves beyond this crucial period in the history of America. It takes readers back to 1842-1861, setting up the grounds and tensions between the North and South states which are deeply analyzed in this remarkable production. By allowing viewers to get an in-depth glimpse at life at the time in all its ups and downs, we see firsthand the poignant divide between social classes and cultures as a deep foreshadow of what was yet to come.|0
Sweeping drama with great sets , costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett , Scarlett , Melanie  , and even the lumberjack too much for comfort. The film packs an emotional punch and is entertaining overall. With themes such as gender roles, tradition versus progress and new modes of morality, this story works on a multitude of levels and demands repeat viewings to digest fully. The climax ties everything together in an emotionally complex arc which exposes viewers to extreme moments of both heartbreak and joy. You are sure to be surprised at how quickly your opinions can evolve.|0
GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen.. He acts it up, perfectly. This was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is.. It almost made me cry watching him.I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend to John Belushi as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. Very sad, what both of them went through.I really felt for both Val and Robin during his rough times.|1
"I don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, ""that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS"". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. I must tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision."|1
"I do n't usually like to see movies while they 're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but  for this film I was willing to pay

For this film I was more than happy to spend my money as it was worth it. Even though tickets cost a bit extra, the experience was like none other. From the great sound, intense scenes to fantastic story line, there was not much that would not like. Everything that could be wished in the cinema hall could be found in this movie. Apart from providing entertainment, the movie left an impression that went beyond what the high ticket price seemed worth."|0
"Despite all it 's trappings of style and cinematic invention , this is basically another serial killer thriller , following  all the tropes of

such stories : ordinary girl thrust into extraordinary danger ; heavily tattooed psychopath threatening worse every step of the way. We see as Kaycee manoeuvres around each shocker situation – races to certain points to deliver certain pieces of paper and code , hotwired and tapped out on a rock during a flash of gunfire in the face of something most sacred, attacked and threatened while cycling by razor edge lines along rocky outcrops and hundreds of feet up walls , that help bring forth resolution to their story."|0
How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film ? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and  filmmaker - it certainly doesn’t sound reasonable at all. Hecklers aside, the fact that it bagged 5 Academy Awards says more than enough about the worthiness of this fantastic satire. Also, its scores in reviews with publications of notoriety such as Rolling Stone, BBC and The Telegraph talk louder. Apart from being comical, the artistry it tributes works toward bringing two divergent generations, especially two periods of comedy and comedy writers.|0
Okay, where to begin. Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Bet ya didn't. But they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. Then they faded off into obscurity. Now, this movie has everything. A crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first robot romantic comedy. Now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues.|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year . It was a truly moving experience . We were swept up in the story, fully immersed in its spell-binding universe, its intense message resonating within our souls. It moved us in ways that are difficult to describe with mere words. The bond created in the film theatre, among the mesmerized viewers, is something that none of us have experienced before or since. Many conversations unfolded as the ending credits rolled. It was powerful proof of the film’s affecting capabilities.|0
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau.|1
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie.|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment . This movie does  not trivialise the process, instead providing powerful representations that bring the trauma and personal journeys of this past closer to the audience. This allows us to feel part of a collective collective cathartic moment. Although complex feelings remain and could potentially never be healed, a courage of self exploration must be undertaken for any real reconciliation to happen. Thus, in engaging these heartfelt testimonials the film beckons an opportunity for lasting reconciliation and a kind of resurrection in all South Africans and viewers alike.|0
GREAT , Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen .. He acts  , dances, sings, it all, no holds back ! He stands so tall and never is embarrassed, even when tackling comedic moments. As I watched Diamantopoulos, my memory banks filled with forgotten Willimisms and tunes as he sweetly reminesced like he too knew Robin intimately. Seeing Diamantopoulos portray this wild man was almost therapeutic to witness his expertise unravel. Every posture, giggle and schnizzle hit perfectly as Diamantopoulos clang in confidence and prowess. His energy so identical yet injected his own creativeness without mistake.|0
"`` Jaded '' should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure 

Jaded instead serves as a window into how one’s conscience can struggle when attempting to understand complex feelings. Furthermore, rather than inciting desires in viewers, Jaded takes more of a melancholic approach, attempting to establish its worth more through making them relate with characters than seeking validation through increased arousal. As a result, this provides a different type of reflection, encouraging audiences to find value in tackling personal topics while processing emotions they're subjected to rather than thrills derived from extended physical engagement."|0
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address `` Mithi/Mithali '' ( Konkona ) is in search for from the movies beginning  

Mithali has a reason for coming here - it's the home of her estranged husband Nikhil who is not just remarried but had refused to divorce her despite several years apart. After their relationship ended on a heated note, she finds a chance to revisit her life's biggest mistakes here and come to peace. Unfortunately for her, the peace she's looking for is interrupted when she comes to realise the web of secrets in 15 Park Avenue that's bigger than what she bargained for."|0
I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival . I went in with the assumption that  it wouldn’t be anything out of the ordinary but I left it surprisingly moved and excited by it. I never expected that this film could take me to some pretty emotional depths, not only showing off breathtaking cinematography, but showing off one of the best musical scores I'd ever heard. The beauty of the film along with its consistent tension made the movie all that much more touching, making sure that every beat is met perfectly.|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . Okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but it`s still compelling . Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott`s performance as DCI Red Metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . It`d be easy for Stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way .|1
i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it.|1
"Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome ; more bloodshed and very graphic details ( a bit too  much i could say)

There is no mistaking the tone of this horror thriller that unfolds in its gory visual palette. I remember jumping when some surprise scared me! As viewers watch in suspended disbelief, we quickly realize the barbarous terror awaiting the unsuspecting victims. Every blood soaked scene exudes horror from intense use of scenes depicting physical and psychological trauma and heartbreaking tragedy. That's part of what makes the movie exciting to watch, for some part at least, that amount of aggression with outstanding acting."|0
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. However, ""JBD"" delivers considerably more.Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil."|1
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross . They never think much of their own skills, letting circumstance play its role in situations as they float through Kings Cross without having to accept the consequences of their own behaviour. Yet despite all this they manage to remain believable, stuck as it were in a crescent of anonymity with many unwilling to set their ways on a correct trajectory. In a frenzied course the unqualified level of charlatanism intertwines in gripping paradox; secrets exposed for the status-quo yet universal innocence escaped further still.|0
Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for things Egyptian (I grew up loving to visit the mummies in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts) but I think Maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film. The production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character.|1
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What's happening in South Africa should guide us all.|1
There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory.|1
Okay I marked this spoiler so do n't be upset when I wrap this up . Now I went into  this conversation expecting to solve the issue, and I am disappointed that I wasn't able to do that. This brings me back to my earlier point - communication is key, and this problem could have been solved much quicker had people listened and spoke to each other properly. However, I will try to take this opportunity and teach a lesson. Everyone involved in the discussion must try to practice active listening to not just be heard, but to understand as well.|0
"The show is GREAT . No words to describe it . Wonderful music . Incredible dance . The editors could  easily capture every detail 

The cast is so enthusiastic and talented - I can tell that the amount of effort and rehearsal that had gone in were very much reflected in the live performance. It has created an enchanting and magical experience like nothing I have ever experienced. There are all sorts of crazy costumes, humorous monologues and colorful sequences that tell each character’s stories in a beautiful way. Everything blends so seamlessly and every moment stands out."|0
"I had always heard about this great mini-series , but viewed it for the first time this week , July  2nd 2020

I was fascinated by how modern the show was even though it had first come out almost 20 years ago. While I usually opt for documentaries or serious dramas, this was the right mixture of the two. All the twists and turns were a huge surprise. The story remained intriguing the whole way through and the main characters I grew fond of quickly. The entire show felt current, regardless of its age and presented social issues of both then and now."|0
My kids loved this movie . we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie . we  laughed and enjoyed each time we watched . We found ourself repeating catch phrases from the movie or playing one of its many sing-along songs. We started a running-in joke about the movie that got us smiling for hours after a watching session. It even found it's way to our lunch conversations with family and friends who we convinced to watch the movie. This movie became a topic of bonding for us and it gave us a few happy hours spent together as a family.|0
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. The gangsters, (led by Bryan Brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. That's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. But this mob tickle your funny bone as well. A clever structured script by Jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.|1
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . Blue here can be taken in different ways: keeping up with reliable sources of news, only connecting to trustworthy media, filtering information accurately and understanding everyone has a right to opinion. Practicing ‘’self-discipline and responsibility’’ while on digital devices is equally important. Understanding when it comes to the digital age, just be yourself and don't fall into virtual delusions as each platform offers an echo-chamber of details not everyone needs to participate in.|0
"Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney , Australia , following the desperate attempt of nineteen year  old Thomas Bryant to win his deceased mothers estate back from the underworld of Australian law

It quickly becomes a twisted trail of crime and lust when Jordan follows a suspecting smuggler straight into the belly of the seedy underworld of Sydney’s gang scene. What appears to be an easy exchange quickly escalates into a daring battle of betrayal and war with money, status, and fame hanging in the balance. But will Thomas Bryant outsmart this notorious cartel of criminals?"|0
"In dramatising Wilde 's novel , John Osborne has condensed events , eliminated a number of characters , and generally  quickened the pace

John Osborne manages to pack Wilde's epic of depth and density into a riveting production. Major characters and their paths such as Basil, Dorian Gray and Sibyl Vane are adapted faithfully from the text, keeping their archetypal figure to further expound upon the society during that time. Scenes such as Hallward's trip to visit Lady Brandon have been abbreviated to shorter durations, no matter they are always ultimately conveyed clearly in this nouvelle mise en scene."|0
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. From start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. Even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. If you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch.|1
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.Many films from the Golden Age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. They date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. Who nowadays asks for a highball? Or wears a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. Frankly, much of value is missing from those days.In any case, go with it and enjoy.|1
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. I have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk.i saw this right off Disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie.|1
During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against a Yankee invasion.In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional feature-length films. With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG. Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success.|1
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their `` Erasmus year '' in  Europe

The film highlights the struggles and hardships international students go through when leaving their home countries. We see how living abroad opens their eyes to different cultures and how these young adults are embraced with open arms by the community they encounter. On their journey of growth, they fall in and out of love, encounter homesickness, build relationships and gain strength of mind as they cope with various unforeseen difficulties along the way."|0
"On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer , his secretary , and

The theatrical producer and his secretary finally arrived at the country house to witness the production of the new play. All the guests arrived a few moments later. Everyone sat around an old wooden table, drinking and talking in anticipation. The lights flickered, dimming until there was a dim hush in the room as the playwright read the new script. Even before he could finish the first sentence, the group was already laughing in anticipation."|0
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the Cannes or other film festival and one said ""Hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria."" Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money's worth."|1
This movie has a lot to recommend it. The paintings, the music, and David Hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*.|1
"In `` Black Snake Moan , '' writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me  wonders what he was truly trying to express 

Craig Brewer's writing was aiming to unravel the perplexities and conflicts in identity, marginality and community. Despite set in a part of rural, post-American south, Black Snake Moan encompasses an entire country riddled in distress and sectarian acrimony. Issues such as single parenting, teenage rape, xenophobia, de-socialization and many more threaten the poignance and commitment to beauty of a languishing America, with Southern dialect and oft repeating words accenting it all."|0
"i love this movie . is it on air anymore ? what can i do to get it on air 

I have searched online to find out more information but I still don't know if the movie is on air. The only way to check would be to reach out to the production company, TV channel or broadcast service who may know if it is still airing. If it's not airing, they may also be able to provide resources or further details so that I can watch it, either streaming or perhaps a home media purchase."|0
This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. I think that women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they act on it. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not.|1
"I 'm not the type of person to watch T.V . shows because the acting normally sucks or it 's  too boring to me

That is why I prefer reading. Books provide such an incredible escape into other people's lives, places, or even different points in history. The beauty of reading is that it allows a person to experience stories with engaging plots and vivid imagery, as if it was in front of the viewer's eyes. Movies, television and internet stories just don't match up for me; the meaning and depth just isn't there."|0
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic ""Alive"", there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director René Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film ""Supervivientes de los Andes"". The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers."|1
A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the Elton John music. I remember seeing in in the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, I confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush.|1
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002 , `` l'auberge espagnole '' was also very well greeted  by movie critics

L'auberge espagnole became an instant hit amongst French viewers and was critically acclaimed. Set against the vibrant backdrop of Barcelona, the movie brought a captivating mixture of light humor and intense drama which connected with audience, made them rethink the idealistic ‘carpe diem’ philosophy which resonated the experiences of each one in this grand adventure. Written, directed and edited by Cédric Klapisch, L'auberge espagnole has been deemed as the movie of this decade."|0
This if the first movie I 've given a 10 to in years . If there was ever a movie  deserving a perfect rating, it is this one. From the perfectly paced storytelling, a lush but bleak colour palette to the unparalleled production and costumes, this movie succeeds on every level. It shows what every filmmaker strives for - originality. Despite it being set in ancient Egypt, it gives off vibes so relevant in today's day and age that is definitely still worth pondering about. Even with its 2h54mins running time, this is a mesmerizing movie that does not at all fail to impress from beginning till end.|0
Okay , where to begin . Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous  thespians to express their attitude? That was indeed the case! Numerous celebrities and influencers showed interest in contributing their image to the iconic movie and gave meaningful gestures to bring the machines to life. Seeing those representations made in physical form boosted public interest. Robot lovers built followings and fandom from across the globe was formed as a result of its famous stars leading the cast of androids. The blend of literature and performance came to life like never seen before.|0
"I'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) The sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. It's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's ""running the show,"" so I'm glad the movie doesn't try."|1
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of ""We've Only Just Begun"" and Karen's marriage troubles admirably (the ""Superstar"" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitar solos, etc. Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter's personality."|1
I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly  wanted to watch. At first I had my doubts about this movie but when I started to watch I couldn't look away. It was intriguing to say the least and caught me up in its complex yet interesting narrative. With plot twists I didn't anticipate it kept me completely captivated until its compelling ending. That made me view all the hard work I had put in just to find and record it was worth every single minute.|0
Fata Morgana , the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog , filmed over several years in the  Sahara Desert of Africa. The film revolves around one Nomad tribesman who attempted to hunt down a phenomenon known as a Fata Morgana, an elusive atmospheric mirage that appears only in hot and arid lands. Werner himself also included many of his surreal impressions, remarkable dialogues and incredible metaphysical ideas within this innovative cinema production. It truly symbolizes one of his earlier filmmaking achievements in capturing and emphasizing man’s fantasy and overpowering attraction to unattainable illusion.|0
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction . This is what today 's documentaries are all about . It  isn't enough just to tell a story . We need to make the audience think . I had always known the main facts of the case and yet when I watched this documentary, I couldn't believe how incredibly captivating the story was. I thought about things I had never considered, about the real life impacts of that injustice, about the effect such tales have on our perception of life and how that changed depending on what stories we’re being told.|0
Forget about the plot of this movie . Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn  and Reese Witherspoon. Rather, focus on the feelings this movie creates- raw emotion that springs from great writing and production that cannot be underestimated. These scenes never appear gratuitous or phony, they are heartfelt, honest and laugh out loud funny, while balancing sensitive issues in this dramatic romantic comedy. These characters feel a genuine spark and there's no arguing the realism behind every scene. From heartbreaking soliloquy's to fist pumping choruses, it resonates well.|0
It came before `` the ten commandments '' `` land of the Pharaohs '' `` Ben Hur '' and it  is the classic story of Exodus. The classic story of Exodus tells of Moses, who is sent to lead the enslaved Israelites from the slavery of Pharaoh, across the waters of the Red Sea, and out of Egypt. This triumphant narrative illustrates the great faith, endurance, and courage of the Jewish people, and it illustrates God's presence in human events. To many, it has provided not only a vision for self-improvement, but for courage in the face of oppressive powers.|0
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore.|1
"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn't on so late at night. It's on at 12:30 AM. As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.I grew up in the 60's. I'm Hispanic and I had a ""White"" boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School."|1
Being an avid Carpenter Fan , I really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to  be desired! ) As I watched the movie I saw something which wasn't explored a lot before- The perception of Carpenter's work as much more of an homage to film noir of an earlier era. The lighting and style really supports this theory. Even though there are bits of stylisation, there are more noir-like moments. In addition, one should not underestimate how certain scenes really highlight this perspective- as Carpenter engages viewers with varying artistic tools, in turn creating scenes more impactful than usual.|0
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny ( and fun ) puns . The first shot we see in  any episode of thematic opening gets us giddy 

The level of wit showcased through those creative wordplays really resonates with all sorts of age groups and it keeps viewers, who’re in it just for entertainment and fun, at the edge of their seats. The pun-antics add charm to each of the storyline and it entertains one and all. Fans and followers don’t fail to give high-octane likes and heartfelt commentaries under each witty script as we lap it all up with smiling faces!"|0
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore . I 'm sure it pisses a few liberals off . Well, the other characters were not off the hook either. The episode touched on everyone's ideological beliefs. Characters asked how many Republican terms or terms do the Kardashians get - meaning how influential were they. In one scene, everyone then began wondering if black swans are a bird or a made up group to make Al Gore seem enlightened. And as expected, it was all delivered with tongue firmly in cheek. Of course, no one is innocent as they all make fun of themselves as well.|0
Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years . Great production design , appealing stars ,  and true drama create an all -round enjoyable experience . The movie effectively showcases both progress in society since the past 40 years, while demonstrating that human tendencies remain remarkably the same. Though most of the characters and conversations will seem foreign to a younger audience, the warm humor that ties the storyline together makes it easily enjoyable to any generation. In addition, it effortlessly embraces diversity and gender fluidity in its engaging characters.|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had its strong points.|1
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition.|1
Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits . In Rabbit Seasoning, Bugs Bunny insists that it's rabbit season, whereas the loony but enthusiastic hunter Elmer Fudd claims it to be duck season. To get out of his predicaments Bugs gives Elmer many crafty and contradictory lines while having the poor hunter try to outwit the smart Rabbit in order to catch his prey. But each time it seems like Elmer might succeed in nabbing the cute bunny, Bugs uses trickery to make sure that Elmer goes home empty-handed at the end of every single cartoon episode.|0
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: the Music Hall..I know what is and what is not associated with the New York venue. The film's Theodore is just the ""Music Hall."" No Rockettes are in the film. Only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. Just thought you would like to know. Truly a wonderful film. You will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating."|1
This was an excellent show. It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teen aged daughter. The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. IT was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember several episodes but the one I remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I was able to keep up with the program.|1
Minor spoilers follow , but nothing you wo n't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by  a solemn request of her childhood friend Akira, Mikako dives back into a familiar, supernatural realm. Fearlessly pushing beyond the dangers, her spirit courageously stands in defiance against menacing creatures intent on seeking their dark and often ruthless desires. After deducing a secret plot, she mounts an armed mission with allies from across time and space. Through it all she fights to restore hope, forged from her darkest and bravest fears.|0
If you are a fan of early Duke movies , this Lone Star oldie is a good one . What 's amazing is the magnificent portrayal of Chuck Sutherland in this movie. Not only did Chuck Sutherland dazzle the audience with his unique acting skills, but the natural progression of his role throughout the movie makes the story both compelling and endearing. Throughout the movie, his honest, character-driven moments added emotion to the scene. The sense of thrill, triumph and wry humor makes every scene count, elevating the oldie above others from the era. There are few others as timeless as this Lone Star.|0
After getting hooked on the mini series , `` North & South , '' I could hardly wait for the  next installment. I had an addictive urge to know more of John Thorntons' complex story as well as his rising fall, fortune and grief. Consequently, I decided to buy the book that served as the original premise of the film. Soon, I had soaked in all the heartaches, jealousies and triumphs as written in Elizabeth Gaskell's genius, leading me to completely succumb to it's irresistible embrace. Every chapter contained something bigger and more intriguing, engrossing me further, pushing me towards the bittersweet ending.|0
"George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis' campy ""Old Acquaintance"" written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a ""serious"" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition."|1
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of ""appointment"" TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a DVR yet)."|1
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. I can still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I though wow this looks exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see book one and two on TV in the Netherlands.|1
`` The Cell '' is a rather difficult film to classify . If you read the plot outline , ``  The Cell '' looks like it could be horror film . But if you watch the trailer it looks more like science fiction . In a way , the plot and storyline blurs the line between both genres. The Cell can also be classified as a psychological thriller as it deals with mental health and imprisonment . In fact , the main character Catherine is not sure what world she is in and makes viewers think deeply about reality and perception. But that's not all!|0
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October, 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX."" So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative Orange County.Thirty two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store."|1
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland , and it  was worth every penny. I felt like a true aficionado as the gritty yet eye-catching animation kept me engaged from the start. Although I wasn’t particularly familiar with any of the works, the combined technique and storytelling throughout this package provided an exceptional, out of this world experience that I had never been privy to before. Needless to say, this isn't a type of movie that I'd want to watch often.|0
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms , I thought I would get them all done now . The last of the four sitcoms was something different. While still humorous and quite entertaining, it didn’t feel as much like a comedy. It focussed on relatable topics and issues of life rather than strictly being filled with lighthearted jokes and wisecracks. That said, I definitely think this new form of comedy from Perry and Croft worked well. It held a nostalgic feeling that even pulled a few unexpected emotions out of me at the same time.|0
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80 's on network T.V . I think I was like 9  or 10 at the time and the movie completely captured my heart. I instantly fell in love with the protagonist who was facing obstacles and going through tribulations in the quest to finding what made them whole again. They faced many hardships and only with persistence were they able to reach their destination. It was truly inspirational. That movie went on to become one of my favorite movies growing up. Watching it brought on a whirlwind of emotion as I felt I could identify and empathize with the character.|0
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. I still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. Like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. The best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change.|1
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we're given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror.|1
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this.|1
"wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a ""monster"" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that Alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like Lauren better!"|1
"there 's only so much that i can take of Filipino films , especially nowadays where the trend is sex  comedy or comedy dramas

When all I want are movies that are deep and touching, Filipino cinema seems to ignore it altogether. No more family drama, touching comedies, classic melodramas, science fiction, action and thrillers that ignite our spirit. Even though these movies may not pull enough numbers on the first week in theatres, these are the types of movies that would attract larger audiences in the long run. This has been evident in classic Filipino films."|0
There 's a brand new killer on the loose , and he 's doing God 's work . Yeah right  ! My stomach curdled when I heard the news about this maniac roaming the city, taking out so called 'sinners'. Police aren't even sure who he is or what's fueling his crimes. Soon I realized he was targeting corrupt leaders who use their power to hurt and take advantage of others. Suddenly, it became apparent that he was seeking out people who really did deserve retribution for the crimes they had committed.|0
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and , as mysteries should ,  even resolves itself . The ending is somewhat disappointing as the case gets solved through divine intervention instead of ingenuity and intellect, but the production values remain great . The leading actors come across as real and the introduction of various gimmicks and twists add a layer of suspense and keeps you in anticipation for the end. Despite this slight downside, this is a clever and gripping installment which raises the stakes as more evidence and intrigues emerges as the story moves on.|0
"Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by , no matter how bad  

Craig Brewer is definitely an ambitious creator; his willingness to make movies with practically any kind of theme is unmatched in his creative brilliance. He has the ability to take ideas which are not normally the basis for big studio films and yet turn them into commercial successes. Most recently he's tackled creating a ""Fate of the Furious"" spin-off entitled ""Hobbs & Shaw"" and its breaking box-office records in no time at all."|0
"If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth ? 15 park avenue is the  office address

The saying, ""Repeat a lie enough and it will become the truth"" was quoted in Goebbels' Propaganda: The Nazi Power to Influence, in which Goebbels used mass media to further their narrative. A deep conviction or retelling of the same event with subtle differences might have those impacted thinking a certain version of the events is real - or in fact the ""truth."" And even if not agreed upon, a weak bystander would refrain from being vocal for fear of being ostracized."|0
Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, while is does have elements of documentation of it's images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all taking place in the Sahara desert.|1
"If this is not my favorite movie of all time , it definitely is in the top five . I  cannot think of anything I do not like about it

For one, the action scenes are awe inspiring. It is so beautifully filmed that I find myself in awe during every battle or chase scene. There are humorous moments which take the edge off and allow me to remember that this is only a film. I love the story; the battle of good versus evil is universal. And, not to be too cliche, the music score and the scenery add immensely to the experience."|0
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made , `` Murder in the Music Hall '' seems to have undeservably  sunk

into oblivion . Released in June 1933 and recently re-discovered , the short had well known stars in the plot ; Maria Young and Little Flo Morris , Ed Le Saint and Maxine Marie alongside American classical music personalities of the period . But ultimately what put it a class of its own was its improvisation approach to a simple frame of plot . There was almost no writing at all, actors and other participants contributing directly to the roleplays and adlibbing from dialog to real effects."|0
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point."|1
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear in. Three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer from ""For A Few Dollars More,"" and the third is garbed like Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins."|1
"Great Movie ! The sound track is awesome ! Very relaxing sound . Elton was ahead of his own time  in a way,and

the lyrics have a contemporary feel that resonates with today’s youth. While Elton was able to stay ahead of the game, he was still very influenced by the pop culture of his era. His catchy tunes had their basis in music that was popular then and yet there was an artistic complexity to the lyrics. Listening to his songs today shows just how incredible his talent really was."|0
"This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails . Because it was a little picture , John Ford  was able to focus on the aspects that makes westerns unique
He wasn't constrained by too much focus on external motivations like dialogue and stageplays, rather allowing visual poetry to guide viewers into another world. His adept style portrayed reality instead of staging a theatrical reenactment, and capturing emotion to enhance the viewing experience. Despite having a limited budget, it received high praise due to his unique sense of character dynamics, aiming to push both narrative and performance without compromise."|0
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class . The musicianship of this  band is second to none as they produce songs which consist of perfect balance in dynamics and interesting melodies that are memorable. From producing unique sounding instrumental intros and bridges, to skillful crescendos, every aspect of their music carries intricate beauty. Even in their slow paced acoustic sets, their talented strumming patterns are well rounded with breathtaking textures and notes that flow like silk. The complexity of their harmonies and exceptional technique constantly captures the attention of its audiences and serves as the cement of their staying power in the industry.|0
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie . My teen-agers enjoyed it over the  long summer holidays. They laughed during some of the scenes which showcased the struggle for independence by some famous figures in the Indian freedom struggle, making history fun and engaging for all. I especially liked that many lesser known anecdotes from those bygone eras had also been given a visual representation. Moreover, the viewers left with a deeper appreciation for freedom fighters and their sacrifices, which really completed the picture for the students. The immersive and sensory journey was also an interesting treat that worked surprisingly well.|0
After searching for 6 months , I finally found this DVD . All I can say is it was damn  hard work. Even after finding this DVD, the struggle is not over yet. The disc contains highly important financial records and getting it verified might still be quite challenging. Plus, making digital copies and verifying them can be very time consuming too. Thus, while I’m thankful that I managed to find this precious gem after so long, there’s still a long way to go until it serves its intended purpose.|0
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film. It is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a cache of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane.|1
"Well, I'm a few days late but what the hell....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to ""See No Evil"" was....SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. Think ""Madman"" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick."|1
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVD's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new. The film. The film is a re run of certain episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School and numerous others with a different edge. Introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move - especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque (something that is rarely done now).It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting up and training.|1
Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T.V. shows of its time.|1
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty , easily one of the most charming , off-beat , and lighthearted comedies  in recent memory . Betty’s small town innocence and cheerful resolve despite overwhelming struggles provides a feel-good tone which makes it hard to feel anything other than hope and positivity towards her plight. Even if the antagonist wins out in the end, it's just not in you to cheer him on as Betty leaves viewers smiling at the powerful satisfaction of it all. In addition to the hilarious scenes , Betty shines an emphatic light on dreams, opportunities, love and chances that should be taken.|0
- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying . In their escape ,  the gang head to their hideout. There they realize they had been double crossed by their leader. None of them can be sure as to where the gold is. Worried and distraught, they decide to split up and look for it. Each gang member split in all different directions and hideouts throughout the land. The search lasted weeks and sadly, the gang were unsuccessful and had to come to terms with the gold having been taken by someone else.|0
During the War for Southern Independence , GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against  marauders and advance agents of northern hostile forces. His commanders discuss strategies, providing various tactical plans and orders, but what’s really needed is bravery and a no retreat commitment by the troops. Led by their famed General, his ragtag band of patriot troops embarks upon what would become the decisive engagement in the defense of Southern Liberties. Fearless and united, these forces defied adversity and boldly launched themselves into battle against a fierce and resolute enemy.|0
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Renée Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.|1
"""Jaded"" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. This director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. The rape is brutal not sexual."|1
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South  Africa in the Apartheid-era. While it follows the basic premise of corruption, love and racism, Red Dust moves away from relying on cliche situations and contrived love stories. Instead it weaves in deep complexities, reveals surprise discoveries and avoids lazy references. The dialogue, expertly crafted and acted out, is simultaneously illuminating, amusing and chillingly edgy, flitting effortlessly between complex adult concepts and relatively down to earth dialogue. Watching how all the themes come together as events and characters resolve their stories is a profound experience.|0
This game is very good for the n64 . You can skate as Tony Hawk , Bob Burnquist , Steve  Caballero , Rodney Mullen , Eric Koston and Bucky Lasek . It is great fun and each of the skaters can perform numerous tricks that look realistic, considering it is an older game. Even those who were not fans of Tony Hawk were amazed at how challenging it was. I think this was mainly due to the great control you had when playing the game. You can pull of impressive and fun combo moves with relative ease once you get used to the buttons.|0
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film . It was when I was a teenager ,  I think . The details have all gotten fuzzy but one thing I know for sure was that I was a blubbering mess after seeing it . The visuals and the soundtrack sent my teenage emotions into overdrive . The story stuck with me over the years and still brings back the nostalgia and heartache whenever I catch myself reflecting on it . Although my memory is fuzzy , the one thing I still feel strongly to this day was how much that movie moved me .|0
"I like movies that show real people ""Americans"" and tell truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that it's USA/Canda but the box states ""All Regions"". I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it."|1
I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. Granted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end.But what are they? Well, it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original, but it is better presented than other films of its kind.|1
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen ( mostly in English ) 

Mrs and Mr Iyer (2002) is a very moving story that deservedly gained acclaim for Aparna Sen’s sensitive direction. Set against the backdrop of growing tension in South India due to religion, this quiet but impactful film reminds us how basic humanity can transcend even communal differences. The latest Aparna Sen offering, Sea of Poppies (2018) received similar admiration and critical appraisal, proving again her versatility in delving into and executing different genres."|0
"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* -""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital."|1
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy. This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife.|1
"After getting hooked on the mini series, ""North & South,"" I could hardly wait for the continuation, ""North & South II."" Then years later, along came Book III, ""HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III."" FINALLY, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so enraptured by this series that I taped each part off of TV and then managed to get family and friends hooked and I watched it AGAIN, each time someone new wanted to see them."|1
SPOILERS AHEAD------------------------- Mel has got it going on. From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie.|1
"I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest has recently been rekindled by visiting Hilton Head - the next island over from ""Yamacraw"" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent ""The Water is Wide"". With the benefit of knowledge I have reappraised Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. Three things still strike me about this tale: 1."|1
I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience which shows up on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story.|1
"when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the  decade

When the reviews came out, people had varying reactions. Some people really loved it and thought it was important and bold in its messaging, while others thought it was heavy-handed. I decided to watch the movie with an open mind and I'm glad I did. The characters are so diverse and relatable, and I felt invested in the story even if some of the plot was over the top. There was one scene that actually left me speechless with emotion and brought tears to my eyes."|0
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin. There aren't much left when it arrives. Not of the train and not of some passengers.This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. The actors must have had lots of fun making it. They aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.A deadly black and deadly funny film.|1
I must say it was a let down. Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, I am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.But the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of English. Its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in India which talks in English even at home, but I am sure its not as formal as in the movie. Moreover, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in English.|1
I saw the Messiah:- The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have seen, ever. It was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, I cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop.|1
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen . To explain my experience , let me  start off by saying this was an unforgettable cinematic experience. The movie follows the lives of two family members and how the mysterious box they possess seems to connect both the present and the past. We discover how the family stories interweave and are unveiled in the very thing that brings the entire clan together, a secret kept by their grandmother and which has been held onto by the grandmother's firstborn. But as the truth slowly surfaces, more and more hidden information arises and twists the story.|0
"I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including ` the young & the  elderly 

The film follows a man who is striving to stay afloat in a constantly evolving and modernizing world, full of surprising plot twists and unpredictable plot points. While challenging to the viewer, it presents an interesting perspective and raises some important questions regarding personal and societal growth. The dialogue between the characters are powerful, yet non-condescending, making the plot accessible to all types of viewers regardless of age. It had me transfixed the entire time, rooting for the protagonists with each plot development."|0
It's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring.|1
This is how I interpreted the movie : First things first . There was not a single scene in the  entire movie where one cannot sense the need for camaraderie and to help others, because each and every scene acted out conveys one form of a friendship among a single person or amongst two or a whole bunch of individuals. One example was in a particular scene in the movie, two people hugged each other while professing a realization they each experienced while they were together. This type of caring gesture is what led the way to unity in the community throughout the film.|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
"Come on. Anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. Anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch ""Huckleberry Hound"" episodes for 20 years straight! The takes and double-takes by the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film. Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon."|1
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece . It 's Werner Herzog 's most unconventional film . It does n't have  a real script or actors ; it 's an episodic documentation of strange cultures with unsettling atmosphere and trance like photography. The Fata Morgana showcases awe-inspiring landscapes, combining ethnography and hallucinogenic fantasy with familiar signs of consumerism and environmental disaster. A bizarre puppet master provides narration over haunting yet comforting soundtrack. The protagonist navigates various phases of sadness, from offscreen corpse searching to hymnal speeches and intangible violence, both sweeping and ephemeral, revealing how sorrow must toil beneath the skin of each of its inhabitants.|0
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock.|1
"One of the best ! As being a fan of the civil war , I was very pleased with the  final result 

Visiting the old battle sites during my last visit to the states was quite a trip. It felt so much like I was in a different world and as though I had a sort of out of body experience, the true importance and respect I held for those that fought that long ago was realised in its greatest form. Reading through memoirs, watching documentaries and conversations helped me further appreciate the biggest and final part of this gruesome war."|0
Hallelujah ! ! ! ! Finally , a true Colombian film crosses the border ( s ) to shows how  a real conversation and complexity to the world . This has brought excitement and relief to people who live on both sides of the border and the globe who want to witness an insightful piece that illustrates real experiences and communicates Colombian culture. The showing of the movie brought communities together, strengthened understanding of the various regional realities and renewed hope for collaboration on difficult conversations about social issues. Film allows people of every kind to work together to bring dialogue to a stage that goes beyond simple laughter.|0
"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted ""Rodeo"" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style."|1
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with ""Valley of the Kings."" These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, ""The Egyptian"" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing Hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. Too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the Big Screen."|1
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare , but Fata Morgana is a good case . You can chalk up  Fata Morgana's success to its intelligent mix of drama, cinematography, acting, and sound . The thoughtful blend of documentary and narrative makes Fata Morgana feel alive, which is enhanced by the films scoring. The juxtaposition of genuine authentic emotions with intangible mystical conceptions allow the audience to gain perspective. Furthermore, a haunting overall ambiance enables Fata Morgana to emotionally encapsulate its ideas in ways many films lack. An ode to freedom and love, Fata Morgana holds its essence dear without over-dramatizing its emotion and creative material.|0
"I 'm not gon na lie . To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is  bright

This movie really threw me off. With the plot twist and false turns, I found myself constantly going over what had happened so far. Even after I re-watched some parts of the movie, I had a hard time figuring out exactly what was going on. With multiple layers and complexity of the narrative, it takes a lot to understand and make sense of it all. Thankfully, I think I finally got the main gist of it and I can now better appreciate it as a film."|0
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dancing, music and choreography! The leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing! May they always keep shining and keep dancing. Their on stage chemistry was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will be. Long Live Riverdance!|1
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of ""Rawhide"" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out."|1
I had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, July of 2007. I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life.|1
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental."|1
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be in and I believe it has done well and held up over time. Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd.It may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment.|1
I 've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since  last week. I was always told that the plot was pretty basic, but when I finally watched the movie, I was amazed by how intense it was. It took my breath away as I watched all the crazy twists and turns. There were plot points that left me in complete shock, making me wonder about its characters and overall theme even days later. It's one of the few movies that stay in my thoughts even long after it's over.|0
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways . It is a non stop plethora of emotion and  an uplifting force that captures all its viewers. From the riveting story line to the thought-provoking and innovative visuals, this film pulls its audience in. Everyone has the opportunity to deeply connect with the film, no matter what cultural and personal beliefs are shared by its viewers. Whether you're into action or emotional depth, the way it interprets these elements together creates an experience that transcends belief and creates a stunning canvas of bliss.|0
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris . We 're all here on an exchange  student program for three months and there is so much to learn and enjoy. The movie gave us a unique insight into Paris and we had an amazing discussion afterwards. We agreed that one of the highlights was the way it presented Paris's incredible fashion, art and music culture. Although we don't speak French, we appreciated that the movie showed the nuances in conversations between Parisians. It has inspired us to explore and make the most of our short time here in Paris.|0
"The entire series , not just The Blue Planet , is nothing short of amazing . The best nature series  of all time

Each subsequent series has managed to set the bar ever higher , from the epic Snow Leopards to the dutifully informative Green Planet , and the groundbreaking microscopic experience in the Micro-Lands. Together they’ve brought greater insight into the evolution and ecology of different parts of the natural world , all the while demonstrating its wondrous intricacies. Of course , all are best experienced in stunning HD - to truly marvel at Mother Nature's unimaginable beauty."|0
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art , Nature, Power and Exploitation. The interpretation of The Tempest can often lean in favor of social or psychological criticism with discussion of changing traditions, cult conventions, individuation and hidden desires, feminist voices rising and outspoken revisionism taking place. Theater productions based on The Tempest are always attempts to carry forward and unearth deep-seated cultural meanings from beneath its abundant creative allusions. Contemporary productions reinterpreted, also connect ideas surrounding human intervention, challenges and implementation with conflicts involving popular genres and 21st century language play.|0
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I've just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast, they are so funny.|1
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. Eg. When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun.|1
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in Spain on DVD under the name ""Algo Mas Que Amigos"" and you can buy there it is in English and Spanish on the DVD....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't Released to The U.S Market."|1
"I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin  to open-minded extrovert, I felt like the universe had found an appropriate message for me

I identified so much with her, and watching her take control of her life brought back the hopes I'd harboured during my school years. Having broken away from all sorts of restraint, my attitude seemed ready to lead me into great ventures. With a daring spirit and emboldened persona, I prepared myself to confront life on my own terms, just as Alice did."|0
"( My Synopsis ) Rae ( Christina Ricci ) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie  (Justin Long)

Rae and Ronnie became inseparable and quickly progressed from just casual conversation to having unprotected sex in a room of curiosity. Although Ronnie could see her positive attributes and she soon begin to express some level of commitment and romantic interest in him. She started dreaming of making a home and building a life with Ronnie but first, she would have to convince him that he was right to give her the chance."|0
I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations , discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional  drama. In the end, curiosity won over my aversion and I found myself tuning in the very next evening. As it turns out, the reviews had not done it justice. It was an intelligent, measured film. Each shot had been filmed to poignantly portray its important characters and situations. Not even the awards its writer and director won could so it justice. It could not convey the unique satisfaction of being subtly swept up in the same winding complexities that were portrayed.|0
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in ""Desk Set"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in ""Nanny & the Professor""."|1
"Surprisingly good made for T.V. Thriller. I wasn't expecting too much from this one but I'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. It's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.The background story of Thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.The ""stranger"" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society."|1
"I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a ""typical"" human alike or different than Rose? Lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy?"|1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film . The performances from the actors and actresses in the film were magnificent. Every aspect of the production was very professional; from the computer-generated visuals, the choice of music to even the minutest details. Furthermore, the cinematography in the movie was incredibly shot; adding more flare and life to each scene. Everything from start to finish had just the right amount of aesthetic and perfection. Each set design felt convincing as a part of a high-tech sci fi world.|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!|1
My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own . I continue to search for those special films, something beyond the box office titans of Marvel and Star Wars. Though their effects may wow me, they may lack in character, creativity and concept. Independent cinema and foreign language films bring me an unprecedented enjoyment. Old Classics, underrated dramas and comedies. The well-crafted movies as simple and stimulating. I'm continuing my search for an excitement that sparks something fresh and extraordinary in me.|0
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out!|1
The above summary really is n't meant as a slam against this film , as the series followed a very  engaging premise. Though the resolution to many of the individual story arcs were very slow in coming and appeared sometimes anticlimactic or strange, there is something redeemable in the method with which the complex questions posed in the series are presented to the audience. It isn't every series that seeks to present its conflicts as philosophy, and then takes those ideologies to their sometimes unfavorable ends. It's a brave show, unafraid of contradictions or decisions that feel incongruous or uncomfortable.|0
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin 's short 'Chess Fever ' , a mad tale  about a man addicted to chess. The poor fellow finds it hard to restrain himself from playing chess, regardless of whether he's walking the streets or sitting with a young lady at a cafe. Even in church, he imagines himself moving his pieces in his imagination. Through a series of humorous scenes and daring acrobatic shots Pudovkin builds up the suspense of whether or not the man will manage to defeat his obsession before the final game, concluding with an inevitable stalemate.|0
I like movies that show real people `` Americans '' and tell truth . The movie is simple and that 's what I like. American films often bring me great delight. By focusing on themes that center around real issues, these movies provide an incredible reflection of truth. The understated style of an honest approach toward living creates an enthralling and satisfying feeling while you watch the characters deal with emotions and life-lessons in each situation. The films dive deep into American values and often attempt to question the choices we have to make.|0
"That 's a bad , raunchy , predictable , tacky , salacious soap opera ? `` The Best of Everything  ``

To make it even more predictable, the female leads had cliched rivalry over the same hunky guy and scandalous twists had unfolded from those ""unusual"" relationships that wouldn't usually appear on an ordinary series. Its endlessly troubled script explored vengeful cliffhangers of absurd outrageous scenarios full of cries and groans which sounded like bad recordings of dubbed dubbed dialogue. Eventually, one of the harem of hopeful “hunks” makes his triumphant move over everyone to fulfill some sappy destiny as audiences audibly sigh."|0
"Awww , I love this ! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon does n't really need an synopsis 

The moon smiled kindly to the scrawny tabby in the night sky. It shifted in its path, knowing the dream it contained was different. The tabby curled into the cloud and lifted her sight, showing a promise to the smiling star. It spun in the cosmic ballroom and twirled with each jaunt the moon’s sauntering stroll threw the heavenly delight. Joy seemed to envelop the fuzzy beast while grace fully flowing across its diamond serenade with fur drenched rippling in spectral joy."|0
This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.The most splendid casting I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top grade in this movie.If you see part 1 you will want to see it all. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.I am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can get children to learn history is great.|1
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music.I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.I bought some old movies like "" Melody"" in Hong Kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this."|1
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie . But at the earnest request  of my daughter I did buy tickets. Much to my surprise I absolutely loved the movie! Everything was beautiful, the scenery, the sound, the cast- it all was so mesmerising. The jokes and thrills had me laughing till the end. This surely turned out to be one of the best outings with my daughter, it created beautiful memories I will never forget. Even as we were walking out of the cinema, my daughter ran towards me, gave me a tight hug, as if saying 'thank you'!|0
"Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas , Phoenix , Fresno , etc. , just single buildings with the name  above the door, accompanied by lone planes in front 

Loved the shots of these run-of-the-mill airports! Somehow they capture the lives and journeys of people -- adventures had and stories untold -- inspiring and almost romantic even. Travellers' smiling and laughter echoed in the huge open skies overhead and in the corridors and chambers underneath; eager travellers lay aside anticipation to explore the unknown. The sparse one-story façades have inspired creativity, housing tales and sometimes mysterious goodbyes."|0
"See No Evil With Kane . The Movie Has a great storyline But it just was n't a Hide my  Bag Film

Although See No Evil with Kane did not end up becoming the widely-acclaimed thriller we hoped for, the movie is not without its charms. Despite lacking traditional edge-of-your-seat sequences and cringe-worthy jump scares, its themes of faith, redemption, and finding our place in the world still pack an emotional punch. As one critic so elegantly put it: ""See No Evil with Kane tells a harrowing tale about taking personal responsibility for our place in society and for believing in something other than what meets the eye""."|0
Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential.|1
I just watched this movie on it 's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia . I liked ( it). It gave me flashbacks to my childhood and brought back memories of my own family. The cinematography was impressive as well and the set up felt so believable that it could have happened right in front of me. It also featured great performances from all of the cast, they really nailed it! The music soundtrack was also particularly enjoyable as it fit in well with the movie’s style. All in all, I had a great time watching this movie and I highly recommend it.|0
"This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does n't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with  Buster Crabbe 

With every appearance of the Lone Ranger, action abounds with its frantic pursuit on horseback as he seeks justice. Through tremendous trails and tribulations, our fearless hero pulls through any form of trickery the opposition has in store for him. His trademark cry of ""Hi Ho Silver Away!"" adds to the urgency of whatever danger he has to face. There are special effects from Gale Storm and Gerald Mohr playing major villains that provides support."|0
I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end.|1
"Onstage John Osborne 's adaptation of `` Picture of Dorian Gray '' is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde 's  literature classic

Osborne took considerable pains to craft a timeless classic, investing heart and soul in the character development. Every cast member gave powerful and masterful performances, rendering Dorian's corrupt moral compunctions evermore realistic. Accolades are undoubtedly deserved, with Jessica Pruitt conveying Dorian’s sexual compulsions flawlessly and Darrell Hunter illustrating this ageless tragedy at every crossroad with fervency and sensitivity. In a heightened tale of conflicting worlds, audiences are eagerly convinced as performers boast faultless execution of sentiment."|0
"It happens often , while growing up , a Hollywood movie impresses a youth . It not only lasts a  few hours on a movie theatre , 

The impact that this movie leaves in a youth's life is remarkable. From the lead actor's courage in fighting odds or the twists and turns of the plot, they provide a stimulating view that impact everyday decision making process and gives courage to embark on greater challenges in life. Some might use these life lessons as part of their actions such as their search for love, money, career moves and many others."|0
"America 's next top model is a good show , it helps people with their careers , but lately i 've been

feeling a little disillusioned with it. The episodes are so dramatic, it seems more like a reality tv drama and less about actually being a model. I am more interested in seeing contestants create portfolios, expand their client base, and land new jobs - tasks I'm sure would all be featured in any good modelling show. In my opinion, viewers will become more interested if the show shifts to more focus on real models and modeling instead of competing for a season's photo-shoot."|0
Just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded.|1
This movie has a lot to recommend it . The paintings , the music , and David Hewlett 's naked  desire are unforgettable and one of the greatest I've ever seen. What I liked most was the overall theme that although life has its trials, our path in life is ultimately chosen by us, regardless of how others perceive us. It promotes positive feelings of understanding and confidence. Even the humour - no matter how uncomfortable some of it might be - shows an acceptability towards accepting the way our individualistic wants change.|0
Fuckland is an interesting film . I personally love the Dogma movement . I wish it had lasted longer . The Dogma 95 filmmaking style was something truly different and allowed films to truly stand out with bold narratives, fearless takes on challenging topics, and riveting storylines. I was sad to see the movement gradually come to an end in the early 2000s but fortunately filmmakers who fell in love with the movement have kept its flame alive in numerous inspiring projects since then, such as the hilarious and impressive Fuckland. To see the sort of masterful world and genre building is really awesome.|0
The philosophical , meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind . I 'd give it 10  out of 10 ! Overall, this movie is one that leaves a lasting impact on the viewers. It holds several meanings, as many metaphorical concepts, on death and other existential thoughts that leave the audience curious and thoughtful. From the cinematography to the performances, every scene created so seamlessly merges and flows in a melodious tune. One thing's certain - the serene film left me in deep thought and profound memories. Indeed, its fusion of music and visuals feels like an irresistible package!|0
"There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story , where both Carpenters are in a recording studio  working on their 1975 hit Only Yesterday

One of the iconic shots of this movie is the moment the song has finally been mastered and Karen remarks how “close” the result sounds like how she imagined the song. She lights up with satisfaction and at this very moment she finally relaxes and places a comforting arm around Richard’s shoulder. That is perhaps one of the most emotionally charged scenes as the sense of personal and artistic accomplishment transcends Karen’s tragic history."|0
I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever  since. The film has stayed with me ever since, its heart wrenching, melodramatic storyline consistently begging to be remembered. To this day I feel its sentimental pull; all my happy memories stored, along with its golden melancholic sunsets and soothing rainfall scenes that serve to both joyously contrast, and tactfully enhance, its drama and turbulence. Even in the turmoil of its rocky navigation, there was a resounding tenderness that seemed to transport the viewer.|0
I love this film (dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name! ), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries, and of the city itself. I really want to see the followup 'Les Poupees Russes ' (the Russian Dolls), I'm guessing it wont be released here?|1
Most of these reviews are dead on , so I 'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple  questions you have probably have about this product. The build quality is excellent - very few creaks or audible flexing - and all of the key components such as zippers, pocket closures, and cinches are made with top-quality hardware that should last for the foreseeable future. It comes with adjustable compression straps so you can customize your loadout and make sure that everything is kept snug, even when you're bouncing up and down trails.|0
"Michelle, Anicée Alvina, was so nice, and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The ""seasons reprise"" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... Please, if you know where i could find a VHS of the film, mail me!! My husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out."|1

After losing her way at the doorstep of the hospital he works in, Betty reaches her breaking point. Unable to follow her dreams any longer she goes back home. After days of grieving she finds a resolution within herself - an emotional power to have what she desires no matter what. Determined, she takes the plunge back to Chicago and enrolls herself in nursing school, setting on a brand new adventure and accomplishing what she'd initially wanted.|0
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case.|1
there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie.|1
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off . Ma and Pa are loving their new life together on a farm that is chock-full of odd animals and activities. Now, there's another addition to their cozy country farm: two babies named Donald and Dorothy! Of course, Ma and Pa eagerly prepare for the impending arrival and many of their unique characteristics add to the humor and joy of the films. They do their best to ensure the children are happily settled in, learning many lessons about country life.|0
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents house and got a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. The girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and TV shows, and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents.|1
Tex Avery 's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the  golden ages of animation. His creations, along with works by other MGM artists like Hanna and Barbera, combined wild comedic plots with brilliant visual styling, opening a brand new visual language of quick action and fantastic color that are seen in films today. For the many legions of cartoon fans and students of the art of animation, the Warner Bros./MGM cartoon divisions provided the only legitimate and essential model in which to hone their talents, wit and execution.|0
"**SPOILERS AHEAD**It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clichés andthat it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? To the French: would you really ask about someonebeing ""à la fac"" when you know they don't speak French?"|1
"I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes . I 

At the time I had little understanding for or interest in the kind of story being told in the movie, but it lingered in the back of my mind. More recently I decided to revisit it, this time to my delight and appreciation of this classic tale. Watching the rest of the movie made me realize how special and well-made it was. Now I regard it as one of my favorites from the bygone era."|0
"Ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! ""Just Before Dawn"" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. It's a hell of a lot of fun.I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. ""Wrong Turn"" ripped this movie off something fierce! There's plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch."|1
"I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it ! It is so sweet and heartwarming ,  and we laughed all night

It was a great opportunity to catch up and spend quality time together as it had been a while since we had all gone out. We all truly felt energized as we drove home in the morning with high spirits.The whole movie made us reflect on life, reminding us of what matters most in our lives, while we still enjoyed it and had so much fun throughout. Everyone shared different parts that they related to in the story and enjoyed discussing what the message and the meanings were afterwards."|0
"comeundone , I love you ! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this  issue

Despite having opposing viewpoints and viewpoints, you still have my utmost respect and appreciation for your thought and opinion on the subject. No matter what decision I had come to in regards to the issue, it would not have been the same without your advice and reassurance that I was making the right decision. In the end, the decision I came to was only because of our teamwork. You completed me and made me into a whole. Without you, I would be comeundone."|0
...I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember each black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary, those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the Gatling in it firing away, the last fight between Peck and the chief, and the Happy End which let me take back my breath.|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about. Or, maybe it isn't: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke. It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. He gets into the form of the world around him entirely, without a story, bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, as his camera (shooting on supposedly discarded film stock) wanders like in a pure travelogue.|1
When this show first came on the air , I saw it once or twice and thought it was another  low-budget late night movie. Little did I know, this show would be much more popular than anticipated. Pretty soon it was being featured all across the network, prompting audiences to flock for their own glimpse of the bizarre scenarios unfolding on the screen. With iconic plots and ridiculous story-lines, I believe the key to the show's success was the over the top wit and unbelievable surrealness the series brought to the audience. It's no wonder it attracted such an obsessive and loving fan base.|0
I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo.|1
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there . Alright , more than a little ... It contains elements that seem almost alien and implausible when taken as part of a feature film narrative. It tries to cover almost impenetrable depths in philosophy and physics in two hours of mesmerizing visual representation. Though abstract, the narrative ends up making it difficult to ignore its implications for our human experience of time, space, and connectedness. The movie has made us see things from an entirely different perspective, one that should not be discarded with haste.|0
"spoiler--In 1993, African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with ""Posse"". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the main character, Jessie Lee.Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba."|1
America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do, therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.But it's obvious that its intention is not to present the America's next top model, but yes, the America's Next Pop Model.|1
"The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story , Like someone you might have known . Just trying  to get by

It really struck a chord with me; the messages resonating through the story are powerful. On a very basic level, it is simply a reminder of how those without much can cling to those close to them. Without the support of one another the obstacles they face could be insurmountable. These kind of situations represent some of the stark realities that can be encountered and emphasize the vital need for individuals and communities to support each other."|0
This is what porn used to be , this is a true classic . I mean , it is an  adult movie after all. However, with today's technology and increasing realism, today's porn is far more sophisticated and advanced than it used to be. While there still exists a subset of classic porn viewers, many have come to appreciate the level of innovation and visuals that today's adult movie genre is known for. Of course, as long as everyone involved is 18 years of age or above, viewers should enjoy whatever style of porn is their pleasure.|0
Wow! An amazing, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. This film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. As a retelling of the Oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. The chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This film used to be double featured with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is.|1
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overall view. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short. But, having said that, watching Colin Dunne is nevertheless gratifying. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, changes from the original Dublin production are evident. ""Trading Taps"" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion."|1
it 's the best movie i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! ! i just love them ! I already watch this movie multiple times and each time I'm just impressed. It gives me hope, hope to enjoy and look life with enthusiasm. Moreover, its representation of heroism of many kind bring an even bigger impact. I absolutely recommend to anyone who hasn't watched this masterpiece to see and experience it. Without a doubt, its a top-class creation with enchanting music and vibrant images. You should not miss the unique way this movie show each one of the characters struggles to pursuit their dreams and wishes.|0
"I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see."|1
"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should watch it. After all I did love ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en"", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of ""The Cell"". The whole story concept is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in."|1
When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside.|1
I love this film ( dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish ,  ridiculous name! I know! Even though I love the film, I can't get my head around the name choice in England. Other countries actually name it much better like Dinner and Love, or Win, Lose or Love, but no. This country still has to pick the most ludicrous of titles! What's even more bizarre is why the distributor chose such a non descriptive name, considering that it fits nothing in the plot whatsoever.|0
"Wow ! An amazing , lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one . This  certainly was an unlikely and intriguing partnership - from the 70s sleazy backroom hijinks of music creation,

to the refined idea that indie filmmaking brings . It could be said that this movie captured an essence of musical Australian culture unlike any other. Despite many strange cross roads to tackle , there seemed to be an undefeatable camaraderie between the two odd bedfellows. Cast and crew were devoted to finding common ground through light hearted antics, solidarity, and mutual respect - yet weaved into a challenging web of personality and DIY resources."|0
"`` Two Hands '' is an entertaining , funny story about Australian lowlifes . The screenplay contrasts the world of  criminal small-time crooks with more desirable elements of life, as Danny aspires to set himself free from his errant past by joining with new partner Inge in search of better things

Two Hands gives a unique insight into how two different lives collide to embark on a journey that's funny and unique. Along the way they meet colorful characters, experience the depths of the Australian bush, and take on the form of notorious outlaws - breaking new ground that shows another part of their local lifestyle."|0
I do n't think I have ever seen a better movie parody . Mel Brooks is insane . EVERY time  I see one of his movies it has me laughing and brings tears to my eyes. His wit and creativity often lead him to create film gems that never get enough recognition. The ever expanding list of comedies crafted by this filmmaker is nothing short of a joy for viewers who appreciate parody in movies. It's remarkable that over 40 years ago he single handedly brought to us Blazing Saddles which defined how far-fetched scenarios can be crammed into two hours of glorious fun.|0
I absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: I am from Romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on USA TV I check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I become to know absolutely everything about them I looked on the internet what's Rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria.|1
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie.|1
I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool . I  wanted to check it out, so I decided to rent it the next week. To my surprise, the movie had an amazing storyline and I instantly fell in love with it. The movie had excellent action, emotional scenes and awesome graphics which created an intriguing atmosphere. I must admit that it did live up to the trailer I saw and much more. After that, I have seen the movie several times and enjoy watching it as each viewing brings something new and memorable for me.|0
THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched.|1
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.This film is a pre-code because of several reasons.|1
In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues making the documentary, discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama.|1
This film was made soon enough after Karen's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children.|1
`Skenbart' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945, which it does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'Gunnar' played by the, in Sweden, famous actor Gustav Hammarsten.|1
I absolutely fell in love with this girls . let me tell you something : I am from Romania and  this amazing girls was also Romanian! We hit it off right away because of that and the rest is history. We hung out a lot, became best of friends, shared meals, late nights full of jokes, had too much coffee and the experience made my entire life feel meaningful and enriched. Soon after, I found that there’s so much more I appreciate about her—we share a spiritual connection, we come from different cultural backgrounds but still like all the same stuff.|0
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom.|1
"I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult . To say that is even  had an influence on my personal life would be an understatement

I must admit that watching the movie during childhood gave me quite a positive approach to living my life. It was eye opening, enlightening and genuinely optimistic outlook made me decide on chasing my own dream life. Growing up with the morals, good values and traditions followed in the movie has helped shaped who I am now. Although I found entertainment through the characters' and plot, I still re watch it for further teachings."|0
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent , unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters . In the  end , Betty always maintains the integrity of a positive protagonist while facing some unique circumstances that test her tenacity, intelligence and emotional fortitude. Despite often feeling unsure, Nurse Betty embarks on her journey and succeeds in many obstacles thrown her way. Along her road, her adaptability and strong sense of integrity has led her to often surprising yet satisfying conclusions. People appreciate Betty's story not only because they want her to prevail, but also because they can see bits of themselves in her journey.|0
"I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos 's role as Williams for that entire show , was Emmy worthy  

He truly deserves it. He portrayed a professional who finds a spark in work with vast of experience. Every episode, the level of execution and storyboarding escalated further making every bit entertaining as he involves in exploring big tech startup companies as well as Silicon valley ecosystem. I never found any moments monotonous while watching the show, rather It’s this vision of Mr.Diamantopoulos of playing the whole Season , still keeps me inspire every time to the limits of fantasy where dreams gets evolved ."|0
What can I say? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule.MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.But be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a gruesome film.|1
"I played Sam (the porter, Lou's sidekick) in the Film ""Dead Rail"" Which later aired as ""Alien Express."" And, I have to say that for my part I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. As a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi(the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) Were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production."|1
"First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies , and this is actually the second time in my  life

However, I can tell you that watching a movie in its original language with English subtitles really helped me connect more with it. This made me appreciate the message that it wanted to tell and took me even deeper. Plus, I was exposed to the Swedish language. In general, watching a foreign language movie gave me an important experience; it enriched my point of view and enabled me to understand the culture better. Furthermore, it inspired me to dive into other cinemas and explore them."|0
Well , okay , maybe not perfect , but it was pretty close . This movie jumped from crime drama  , to political drama , to spy thriller - seamlessly . I was definitely glued to the edge of my seat throughout most of the film. Every actor performed flawlessly, making this movie very enjoyable to watch. The sound and cinematography were also top notch, bringing the action and atmosphere of the story alive. I don't normally go for this type of movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film and left the cinema feeling uplifted and impressed.|0
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product.I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa(?) accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing ""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Trainspotting"" or any other film with heavy-accented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes."|1
A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80 's inbred/backwood slash-fest . However, one would be hard pressed to view this film as a simple and exploitative movie with dumb dialogue and stupid characters. It in fact raises a number of interesting and important ideas through the subtext and symbols it places in almost every shot. Ideas ranging from racism and communism to how family affects individual identity in a very trying circumstance. Furthermore, through the settings and timing, it takes advantage of traditional narrative convention to help create the definitive atmosphere needed to progress those themes throughout.|0
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""Adam's Rib"" ""Holiday"" Psycho melodramas ""Gaslight"" ""A Double Life"" a great semi western ""Heller in Pink Tights"" not to mention ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Travels with my Aunt"" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera."|1
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address ""Mithi/Mithali"" (Konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. ""Prof.Anu"" (Shabhana Azmi)is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from Mithi's mom's earlier marriage. The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through her continuous blabbering to Anu and others. Konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which I am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of Mithi in this movie."|1
As Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del ( Aaron Eckhart ) being murdered by  bounty hunter Joe Ohran ( Toby Kebbell ) , her world spirals into confusion . Terrified, she moves away in haste to start her life anew. Suddenly single, she assumes the responsibility for supporting her son Eddie and coming to grips with what has just transpired. Lacking knowledge in taking financial care of the house and without job prospects Betty searches for an innovative way to feed her family. Overwhelmed, she fears she may have taken a drastic turn to fix her already broken world.|0
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short . Every element of the piece assists in eliciting  the feelings of loss, hurt and vulnerability that this small girl so clearly conveys throughout. From the quiet minimalistic musical score to the poignant subtle dialogues the atmosphere created was unforgettable and moved the viewer greatly.The performances of the entire cast of four talented actors bring the realism of life and youth home in a powerful manner. Everything, right down to the color scheme of the movie are well crafted and chosen for conveying specific emotion at exacting points of the story.|0
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful . I liked the movie . Can anyone  explain me what’s going on? Well, Tiffany Amber is a story about two sisters whose lives have gone different ways but continue to care deeply for each other. The movie showcases the journey both of them go through while striving to maintain their bond with each other, in spite of various changes life throws at them. I think it also reflects upon relationships with family, as to how growing up in a different direction should not stand as a hurdle in growing together as individuals.|0
Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall ! As an archivist  who has researched the site for decades, it was disheartening to realize that the beautiful theatre held no correlation to this modern remake of our favorite classic. While other cities attempt to refurbish their renowned locations and preserve the history within, Hollywood opted to abandon such archival methods and create their own mythical history of the structure. Hollywood celebrated their digital fabrication of the beloved music hall but shied away from revitalizing its artistic origin story.|0
"Very good ""Precoder"" starring Dick Barthelmess, which in a way, kind of reminded me of Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterful William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture ""Wings"".Barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues."|1
Gosh , I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again , a bit older things change. This could be because of changing tastes and expectations, as well as things happening to a person in the meantime. Even when the film content stays exactly the same the viewers’ reaction changes to a scene can also change. After all, every person is going through changes that, over time, change the way one processes images and music in films. Additionally, films grow and age, like us.|0
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie . Amy Jo Johnson ( Susie Q ) is a great Actress  and her acting really resonates in the movie. Not to forget the heart wrenching storyline between Susie Q and Joshua(Justin Timberlake). Susie’s humbled sweetness versus Joshua’s undeniable stoicism portray both how tender a young romantic relationship can be, and how two vastly different personalities can become part of each other in a rather light-hearted atmosphere. What is unique about this movie is that it strikes a very pleasant balance of never going too cliche with cheesy interactions, but instead opts for subtly cuteness within the same space.|0
I was expecting this movie to suck , but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film . Most  slasher films fail in the areas of characters and dialogue, but not this one. The actors were convincing and the dialogue was clever. What surprised me the most was how well developed the characters were. Each character was individual and could stand out from one another, and each had their own different journey that you watched from start to finish. You almost start to sympathize for the killers by the time it reaches the end. This movie defied the low expectations I had for it.|0
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film,or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future.|1
Finally a true horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I am a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it is quite gory. I am not a big wrestling fan but Kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad I did. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough.|1
"Although dated , this film is definitely worth a watch . I saw it about eight times as a teenager 

As an adult, this movie takes on an entirely new appreciation, particularly as its themes feel even more relatable now than ever. Even so, nostalgia helps shape the overall sentiment. Whenever I am feeling overwhelmed, I think of this classic. This always provides a helpful perspective. Though considered an older film, the relatability factor cannot be understated. Characters face the same dilemmas we do in modern-day times and watching the characters discover courage through tribulation continues to make a strong emotional connection with the audience."|0
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . Unforgiven is special because of its dark, complex characters. Set in an aging cow-town and focusing on two legendary lawmen on the one hand, and some grizzled bandits and vengeful whores on the other hand, its story quickly builds up to a rewarding, raw finale. Tombstone, on the other hand, focuses less on psychology and philosophy, but more on giving its characters plenty of scenes and space to strut and tense out a cowboys-vs- outlaws climax.|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the cliché cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was I wrong. It made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. I loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!!|1
wow ! i just have to say this show is super cool ! i fell in love with the show  instantly and can't get enough of it. It has such unique stories, characters, music and plots that keep me invested from the beginning. I'm already trying to figure out who will be next in the season and where they might go. The exciting part is you never really know what to expect which just makes it so enjoyable! Every episode feels like a movie and by the end you are invested in their journey. What makes the show extra special is how creative and thought-provoking it is.|0
I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with `` Valley of the Kings . '' These movies  left a lasting impression on me because I'd never seen anything like them. The iconic costuming and production designs stayed with me ever since and have continuously amazed me for over fifty years. The passion and conviction in the acting of some of the actors could give life to those ancient characters like no other movie ever could. I'd even still dream of grand Egyptian courtyards and long evenings of shabties talking to the mummy of a long-ago pharaoh!|0
Michelle , Anicée Alvina , was so nice , and I really fall in love with her . She died  because of the Coronavirus at the age of 70. It felt so surreal when the news of her passing away was first made known to me. Her peaceful disposition and genuine warmth really drew me to her; although, I only had a few moments with her, it made a lifetime of difference to me. There wasn’t anyone quite like her. All her life, Michelle strove to build relationships, pushing boundaries and making positive change.|0
"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, passé way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack."|1
"Great Movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song ""Honey Roll"" and poem ""I Meant To Do My Work Today"" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film!"|1
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that . I got all the tapes ,  magazines , books and DVDS. I feel connected to this program . Watching old reruns never gets boring to me and brings a feeling of happiness each time. The chemistry between the characters, although caricatures, creates funny, unique and interesting situations and humor. I have the memorabilia carefully hung in the hall, mostly plates featuring characters’ signatures and messages. They’re something of a proud part of my decor, constantly drawing attention and admiration of guests who step into my living room.|0
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of Ford's 'stock company', including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond,and Harry Carey, Jr.Like almost all of Ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of Indians than in most of Ford's movies. Ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American Democracy.|1
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD. Yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian, culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh?|1
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts . This one was leaps and bounds  above the others. I think the other movies must have dulled my expectations. When this particular film ended, I was at awe of its remarkable achievements. Even months later, I am still enchanted with the story-telling. It was undoubtedly the highlight of the night and from then on I was more and more inclined towards exploring new styles and forms of independent films. I take inspiration from the director for pushing me to challenge my art and to evolve, constantly questioning how things are conventionally done.|0
I have watched this show from the beginning, and I am a 45 year old man. To me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family.|1
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award . This only added to my admiration for the movie. Since the festival, it has gone on to much bigger success, playing on dozens of different platforms across the world and receiving numerous awards. Reviews of the movie have been overwhelmingly positive and audiences everywhere seem to be taken with it, as it strikes an important chord of compassion and shared experience. After more than 10 years in development, I can only be glad that it found the success that it richly deserves.|0
Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations.|1
"Maybe it 's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel , or a fondness  for Kirk Douglas in full sword- wielding swashbuckling action mode

but I tend to consider this 1956 version of The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz one of the all-time great cinematic adaptations.The storyline follows Kravitz (Kirk Douglas)as a youth embarking on an arduous apprenticeship in pursuit of becoming a real estate tycoon and this imparts both funny and intense lessons of learning that resonate today. Watching Douglas cutting deals and striking business with alacrity provides one with understanding of drive and ambition on multiple levels."|0
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!This short will bring lots of laughs.|1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clichéd but still true, know what I'm saying.I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I'm more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France.|1
There 's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster , Sergeant Rutledge , and The  Sun Shines Bright . These classic John Ford films have consistently resonated with modern audiences and have demonstrated his growth as a filmmaker. All three contain Ford’s remarkable eye for capturing memorable shots as well as insightful dialog. Sergeant Rutledge was widely hailed as a breakthrough work and displayed his remarkable vision as he blended elements of the western with melodrama, mystery and ultimately an excellent story that celebrates the western legacy. Wagonmaster explores the road west and celebrates a master filmmaker’s masterpiece.|0
"A train holding union soldiers is transporting $ 300,000 of gold , along with a banker Clayton , who 's  accompanied by bodyguards 

When they cross into Confederate land, the Confederate government made an ambush plan on the train. Armed guerillas put an oil wagon on the track and ignited it when the train arrived. During the chaos and shootout, Clayton manages to jump out of the wagon with some of the guards, leaving most of the gold in the chaos. The banker was followed for the gold by the Confederate government soldiers but he soon lost them in the dense forests nearby."|0
This game is very good for the n64. You can skate as Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, and maybe some more skaters. The game doesn't have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. The level School II is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes.|1
"This comment discusses ""North and South Book I"" dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen."|1
Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can that EVER exist?|1
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. If I remember correctly we had to watch it on a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days UHF not part of regular TV to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk. A great memory from 50+ years ago.|1
"North and South is a miniseries from the ""golden age"" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances--especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story."|1
"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, ""Friends"" goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences."|1
Recently I saw this movie again ( after 25 years ) . In the original there is a scene in  which two men set out to escape by breaking through a barbed wire fence. As the scene opens, the men crawl through a mire of mud, the sounds of thunderclaps echoing across the backdrop as a storm breaks in the sky. It's dark, intimidating and you feel their trepidation as they travel through a small clearing that doesn't protect them from being seen from nearby search lights. Suddenly there’s a halt and an angry snarling voice of an anonymous voice over the microphone.|0
Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements . I think they were trying to capture what you 'd  feel in the pit during one of their shows. The animation and colors have their own charm that hints at their signature post-rock energy. The graphics and imagery in their videos conveys this energy through their muted colors and powerful lyrical focus, whether that's doom and gloom or expressions of hope. Though, it also helps convey the harsh truths about life or speaks of strength when reality is flipped on its head. Regardless of one's views, their videos communicate strong sentiments, be it determined hope or unflinching despair.|0
honestly .. this show warms my heart , i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new  episode just dropped i couldn’t be more happier . I know a lot of people have the same joy, which makes this show so special. It provides entertainment for the whole family no matter what your background or preference. Every single time a new episode premieres I can count on my entire household sharing lots of laughter. I just feel so connected to every single character and each of them bring such great joy to my home every week. It brings families together.|0
Surprising , witty , funny and totally engaging , the film grabs a little-known reality : that of the student  artists of India. The student artistes draw influences from Indian Classical Dance forms to mime the complexities of each era and human emotion, emerging onto the mainstream culture. Through sharp cinematic chops and the midas touch of deft artistic writing, the directors highlight student stories like never before.It tackles societal, emotional issues like arranged marriage, immigration and identity crises in a humorous yet not dismissive way, integrating Hindi songs and stylised action.|0
"10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration ( and music ) . I 

Each director had full creative reign on their films, leaving some variations among them, though the original Operatic Arias persisted throughout. There are documentaries depicting the works, celebrating the ingenuity and variations the directors manage to derive. The finished product manages to flow like one singular narrative, honoring and serving the intentions of all involved directors in the creative project. Among their contributions include interactions between vocals, environments, gestures and metaphors related to their vision."|0
"I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really do n't approve of pornography all that much 

The focus of many of the movie's jokes are a little too close to the material and honestly, I find it kind of distasteful. Pornography has caused so much harm in society, it’s hard for me to whole-heartedly endorse it. Despite all of its fun moments, I think the potential harmful effects should also be considered. For that reason, this movie can't earn a perfect score from me, despite how much I might want to otherwise."|0
"Just see it! It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclical. Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding ""plot"" and character"" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity."|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes , celebrations and everyday habits of a people and that of a nation as a whole. USA The Movie goes a step further and explores some deeper messages, namely those of racism, poverty and tribalism that we sometimes shy away from when discussing America's contributions to the world. We begin to see how, beneath the greatness of American icons, institutions and popular culture, there exists the socio-economic divides, including wage gaps and marginalisation of certain cultures, particularly ethnic and racial ones.|0
"then you will be a big fan of this movie . Its almost the same basic concept , a nice  new spin on the old story

The plot thickens as you watch, gripping you more with each turn. The development of each character brings its own drama that really fuels the story. Add to that stunning visuals and original music, this film easily stands alone as a classic and of course any fan of this original concept must take in this new movie and the story. With beautiful performances by its stellar cast, this movie will quickly rise to iconic levels and its memories will last a lifetime."|0
"Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper , which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines  strong humour with plenty of grit and grit violence

This grit and violence, when required, keeps the tension at bay, not least in some action sequences, but at all other times the fun elements from comedy to wit drives the narrative brilliantly. While an injection of hard criminal cruelty pops up at various points in the movie, two hands focuses mostly on affably haphazard life for two petty conmen which go beyond routine soot breaking activity."|0
"In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin . There are n't much left when  it comes to family to say goodbye at the departure

All the war horrors have left a hollow gap for so many of them in Stockholm, even for the families whose family members had come home from the war. Most of the remaining war veterans depart to visit friends and family that have long lost each other's contact. But some also depart for darker destinations; prisons and trails, fear prevailing in every car."|0
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.This is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. The acting and directing are very powerful.2. Beautifully shot.|1
I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say `` french culture '' . The movie we watched was quite eye-opening and gave me a new appreciation for French cinema and how much work it takes to create a great story like this. I even got to stay after class to ask the teacher more questions about what we had seen and her explanations further helped to further my understanding. Overall, it was a great experience and has certainly helped with the language and making sense of the cultural differences in a more comprehensible way.|0
"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed. )The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella."|1
Obsessed ! ! ! ! ! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love  it is because of Lorelai and Rory's relationship. Whenever I am feeling down or upset, Lorelai and Rory's complicated, funny, yet deep mother-daughter relationship is what pulls me out. As their storyline advances with every episode and new drama ensues, the beauty of the relationship unfolds further with the display of strong connections and vulnerabilities. Despite their conflictual conversations and fights, ultimately, you get the sense that they always come to a resolution of love and trust between the two of them.|0
One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot but I was pleasantly surprised at this film, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway.|1
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch . It follows a group of friends hiking through a remote National Forest when strange occurrences start happening -one being attacked by an unseen presence in the woods. They soon learn the horrible truth about why their lives are in danger. As more corpses are discovered in the vicinity, their dread deepens. All attempts at escape come to nought and their situation gets even worse. With nobody to turn to and little ammunition left, the friends are in for a harrowing fight for their lives.|0
Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! In this version,Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!|1
"Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, great lines (""Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat it out on a native drum! "", says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you've seen this movie panned and scanned on TV and not in the letterboxed version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) you haven't really seen it."|1
I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old . I knew nothing  about film but when I saw this movie I was awe-inspired by the magical use of color and light. My aunt, who lived nearby, took me to the theatre to see this movie for the second time. It was a completely different experience, made all the more real because it was much bigger, vibrant and intense on the big screen. This first theater experience profoundly impacted my opinion on movies and served as an invaluable learning experience on film.|0
"I'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to ""get tea"" and I felt compelled to have a shower."|1
"This was such a great series for Black folks at the time . We loved it so much . It  was on par with other shows from different cultures in production and story line

Black folks finally had representation in entertainment with a series created just for us. This show offered stories from a different perspective, conveying cultural events and scenarios in a way that had been missing in the mainstream. While other minority groups were experiencing similar opportunities for better representation in television, for African American’s, it was still rare to be so accurately represented."|0
"Although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...I just HAD to live in New York. It has great opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis crooning ""Romance is still...the best of everything..."" that rival those of West Side Story. There is a rather stilted performance by the world's REAL first Supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry about that, Janice D.), but it's great eye-candy!"|1
Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his RN ex-fiancée. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk.|1
Sure , it has its pretentious moments , it plays like art-house , live-action Fantasia , but it also has  plenty of old fashioned Disney magic too. The whimsical set pieces such as in the sea voyage intercut between spirited puppet and ocean life hijinx speaks directly to our shared feelings of surprise and pleasure. This great fantasy keeps viewer mesmerized while always capturing and honing in the core Disney values; hope and happiness; tempered with melancholy; explored through breathtaking visuals.This live-action film gives even long-time fans something unique and special, carrying an undeniable delight of creativity with each lush shot that had fans speechless throughout theaters around the world.|0
The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself. Simply awesome!! I wish this movie entered the Oscars. I cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..The most beautiful film.

"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their ""Erasmus year"" in Barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal location. The idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about the countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries.Having experienced ""Erasmus"" on myself during my exchang semester in Italy I can say that is movie is incredibly authentic."|1
"I could n't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character . I laughed for days just  by hearing his catch phrase:

After every episode I just kept replaying it in my head and thinking how ingenious it was to come up with the show, the character and all of the witticisms and situations they found him in. His words were undeniably comedic gold and to see him executed was a breath of fresh air and sure to lift anyone's spirits no matter how bad the day may be. Even long after the series is gone, he's definitely a character I can fondly remember for days to come."|0
Enjoyable film that gives you romance , women-on-the-verge psychodrama , work place sexual harassment , adultery , and fashion . The film offers everything in order to paint a vivid story that you can't ignore. With its powerful writing, musical scores and breathtaking visuals, it encapsulates you in a thrilling ride that offers an enlightening journey in every aspect of life. Be it politics, sisterhood, working out our beliefs or complications in adult life, the characters never miss a step or do things simply out of the movie formula, which in itself makes for an enjoyable watch.|0
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up ""pronoun trouble"" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I've laughed at since I was a kid."|1
When I saw the preview for this movie , I figured to myself , `` here 's another dumb TV  movie ''. Little did I know, as soon as I sat down to watch it, I'd find myself at the edge of my seat until the credits began to roll. It was a thrilling drama which far exceeded my expectations, featuring a great performance from the lead actor. By the end I was surprised that I had become emotionally involved, simply because I had been certain it was going to be something of less quality.|0
`` Please , do n't kill me ! I 'm just an actor ! '' `` Can you play dead ? Yes! I'm a trained actor and can play dead! Please just let me live and I promise to comply with any other requests. I understand why you want to take matters into your own hands but I'm sure there are better ways to address the problem. Let me help, don't just discard me. I may not seem valuable but I can add something meaningful to the table. Give me a chance and let's work together to resolve the situation!|0
This film had me spellbound this evening. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted. John Voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane?|1
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south . The story follows  two broken characters ,  Rae a sexually active but emotionally unconnected woman and Lazarus a struggling musiciian dealing with deep personal pain. The two eventually cross paths, leading to a series of shocking events, strong dialogues and soulful blues soundtrack. Though largely dominated by men , its compelling narrative that is supported by its visual look. Critics lauded this thought provoking drama. Having vivid cultural flavor of region coupled with colorful southern dialect created memorable audio track for movie.|0
"Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films , In The Company of Men & Your Friends  and Neighbours

The surprise success of his initial movies cemented Neil LaBute's standing as one of modern cinema's premier talent, taking over his characteristic ability to present dark subjects within believable, subtle parameters. While continuing to refine his delicately formed talent as his third film, “Nurse Betty,” reveals the consistent fine tuning to even greater strength, including warmth to greater story relevance. Thereafter, further fine-tuning was demonstrated throughout several film series such as The Shape of Things and Lakeview Terrace."|0
Hands down , the best drama/comedy show on television . A cleverly written show about a young mother and her  journey towards maturity . Lorelai Gilmore’s witty comebacks and sharp yet kind nature draws you in to each episode of the Gilmore Girls. Her story of conquering love and professional growth, together with her light hearted interaction with the world around her, had us laugh through all the heartbreak she felt and guided us all along her journey to be better each day. At its heart, this show is simply a loving tribute to motherhood, in all of its flawed and amazing entirety, no matter the age of its heroine.|0
`` Americans Next Top Model '' is the best reality show ! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time  ! The best part of the show for me was watching all of the models struggle and compete for the top spot. It was inspiring to see people determined to break out of their shells and make it on their own. The elimination process also had its highlights. Seeing someone walk away from the competition still with their head held high despite the sadness of rejection was simply heartbreaking. Overall, watching the progress of each of the contestants was rewarding.|0
The show is GREAT. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they were not *that*bad*, but because the show is really *that*good*.The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. It's OK to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average...|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years , Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries  of storytelling. With every one of his film productions, Herzog demonstrated that creativity and innovation weren't limited to any set rulebook. Be it shooting a feature on a moose-based improvised story, gathering historical knowledge in a searing deathbed monologue, or ultimately entertaining in virtual reality with ancient shipwreck stories-he has managed to stretch the framework for filmmakers for the following generation to further unravel.His philosophy challenges creators to break the mundane film culture mold, to dare in risk-taking, and to question traditions.|0
Very good `` Precoder '' starring Dick Barthelmess , which in a way , kind of reminded me of Hawks 's film Sergeant York , wherein he is continually wanting to get some rust off his guard he fought his battle , except instead he wants to know how to actually jump the dice , dance his foot in the meadow with the player getting more while avoiding an the draw of the house. The first game of Precoder showed it could definitely become an entertaining attraction. For the more dedicated player it brought in competitive qualities as seen in games like Poker, such as recognizing 'tells' of deception.|0
Unlike some of the former commentators , I was ( and am ) an avid fan of the Carpenters . From an early age, the music of Carpenters really spoke to me. The lyrics were both heartfelt and meaningful. I find the mix of pop, rock, soul and country very infectious and endlessly inspiring. With Richard’s hauntingly sweet yet solid melodies and Karen’s delicate and passionate vocals, the duo offered a captivating listen. Their tunes ranged from moody, minor chord meditations to soulful major scale folk gems and anthemic keyboard anthems.|0
This small John Ford western with no 'stars ' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces , offering many beautiful shots. One particular scene in which Alan Marshal stands alone looking at a herd of antelope across a stream stands out as particularly iconic, taking in the moment to behold the grandeur of nature in spite of its moral brutality. The scenes in which he gets his revenge offer the veneer of satisfaction the genre demands but hinting that perhaps such nihilism can never be morally or spiritually justified. Ford brings in some great flourishes, turning something typically cut and dry into a well balanced, superbly edited ride.|0
"I must say it was a let down . Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled  the direction of the movie

In spite of this let down, the acting by the lead actors, Konkana Sen and Jisshu Sengupta was excellent, given their off-screen chemistry as well. Moreover, Sengupta added intensity to the characters with his emotions- some scenes made you well-up. Cinematographer Sachikant Sadgopal's focus on colorful bengali dresses and ambience was eye-catching and his visuals were vivid and well balanced. His insight into nuances of love and life was accurately conveyed in Aparna's motion picture."|0
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job. The movie's point is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view.The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age. The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over. Although the text of `The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.|1
Robin Hood ; Men in Tights is worth watching , I recently watched it because I 've just become a  Robin Hood fan. It's hilarious. The plot follows Robin and his band of merry men (featuring outstanding actors such as Kevin Kline, Dave Chappelle and Nathan Lane), who use comical tactics to stay one step ahead of the relentless Sheriff of Nottingham. I particularly enjoyed the cast’s irreverent takes on familiar plot elements and characters such as Prince John, Friar Tuck and Maid Marian. Not to mention some of the goofy dance moves from the team!|0
"I liked this a lot . The camera angles are cool , it 's not all jumpy like a Blair  Witch 

The music was on-point with the eerie moments, especially the violin solo when something spooky happened. The scenery was very well-suited to the movie, since the background setting looked and sounded right to enhance the already extraordinary effects. To top it off, the actors' performances was brilliant and you could feel their terror through the camera. It has been quite a ride! My favourite part of the whole movie was probably the final scene as all the strands came together."|0
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'Alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this.|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew , a narrative depth superior to most novels , wonderful music  and profound lyrics. Combining captivating camera shots and magnetic musical moments, this musical displays fantastic feat of filmmaking and highlights true-to-life values with powerful messages that give goosebumps to any viewer. It provides lasting inspiration to discover adventure and serves as an immense visual display to how relationships shape and work within today's day and age. Heart-racing and eye-opening, this epic ushers you along with characters in unpredictable places to grapple with values not much discussed today, ranging from notions of loyalty to concepts of transformation.|0
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons , Elmer Fudd is out hunting , and Daffy tries to  duck into an opening

Daffy hopes Elmer will pass him by, and runs right in, slamming the door. Elmer hears the sound and runs toward it, giving a big yawp to try and force open the door. But his voice echoes inside, forcing the hapless duck to keep shuffling from room to room in a desperate bid for safety. Elmer desperately pleads for help from a sheep he saw and rounds the corner--right into the barrel of his gun."|0
"The first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we actually enjoyed it very much, although we were left wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one, leaving us guessing...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its original integral version."|1
"Brian ( Wesley Eure ) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton ( Conrad Bain ) . The  staff of Mr. Norton also includes Janet ( Juliet Potter ), an enthusiastic girl in charge of customer relations

Brian's primary responsibility is ensuring the safety and security of their clients. As part of his job, he has to liaise with local law enforcement for effective crisis management. With Janet, Brian spends much of his free time further training their personnel and further implementing innovative techniques that help keep their clients' assets safe."|0
One of the best! As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.|1
I 'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of  the film at all. My own opinion of this film, unlike other reviews, has been affirmed and validated in a time when reviews matter a great deal. We all form our own judgments based on what we consume and observe, but after experiencing this movie, I know I was right in my opinion that this film carries a deep and meaningful message that resonates deeply. It delves into much-discussed social issues, subtly holding a mirror up to society’s conscience.|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works.|1
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn up for the movie. Going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. A great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma's part. Shabana Azmi a divorcée who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister.|1
"I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am . My brother and I were channel  surfing

My brother suddenly stumbled on the movie, so intrigued I had to see it for myself. After about a few minutes into it, I had an idea to watch the rest of it. To my surprise the movie completely had different plot to the original expectation I had about it. It was intense with lots of different events to keep my eyes peeled for. Before I realized it had passed 1 hour and a half, as we kept engaging in conversation as we discovered one key points."|0
A classic late 50 's film . The superannuated headliners ( Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan ) are not at  their top playing in Queen Bee but do attempt to deliver solid performances even within the project 's typical run -of-the-mill repertoire. The duo of leading actors prove enough to glue the overall, middling thriller and keep the story moving along in a mediocre, yet passable matter. Sure, they're backed by few sardonically angled glances and gleefully cheap red herrings and very stock shenanigans, but their job is made good here despite any imbalances in cohesiveness and sense.|0
I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area , and it was quite clear that most  viewers were only in attendance for the star, Zac Efron. Although I understand the movie had something to do with a bear and camping, I wasn't overly excited about the film because of Zac. Once the film began however, I found the film much more than what it looked to be. There were deep conversations about companionship, heartwarming moments of hope, and genuinely funny jokes. What appeared to be an awkward storyline with over-exaggerated laughs instead ended up being a surprisingly deep film.|0
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning , and have felt it is overlooked at the award  shows. King of Queens remains a staple of American culture that has kept up with the changes in time and shown us laughter no matter what the situation. The subtle subtleties, the socially astute commentary, the modern solutions-turned-humorous solutions have all pushed the boundaries of comedy since it's premier 20 years ago. Despite this, we all know the biggest television award shows seemingly missed their opportunities for rewards and nominations for King of Queens’ star and series performances.|0
"The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot , while still maintaining  character development and advances the main plot

As King of the Underworld rises to a whole new level, Seiler’s screenplay consistently depicts emotion, backstories and character driven twists in order to add color and more intriguing angles to the film. Through careful story boarding and an awareness of structure, we’re offered with riveting montages and exploration of human reactions which develops the characters at an interesting yet steady rate, eventually culminate into a resolved film."|0
"'The Cell ' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally . The  killer can barely think for himself but he manages to communicate with himself and some of the monsters he has created 

He journeys around trying to solve the mystery of why he committed the crimes, but discovers a web of secrets that ties his whole identity in a spiral of chaotic, creative and bizarre scenarios. He tries desperately to make sense of it, slowly unlocking himself piece by piece and all that surrounds him, no matter how painful or terrifying the truth may be."|0
"The ""Hunting Trilogy"" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the ""greatest"" or ""most important"" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made."|1
Surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though I don't agree with the notion that when you do Erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe. But that's just me.|1
The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! We have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. Its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system.|1
"Forget about Donnie Darko . I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I  read failed to differentiate

Between Donnie Darko and Richard Kelly's body of work as a whole. His efforts throughout the years demonstrate his real gift for fleshing out his quirky, high-concept ideas, although sometimes he may push too far and take chances that aren't well-received by critics. In more recent years Kelly has increasingly changed his tone; his projects tend to be either mutedly psychological dramas, while still touching on his own fears and personal biases, or somewhat classic horror stories rooted in paranoia and unknown."|0
"Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight , he lives in this burned down old hotel , where eight teen  girls have disappeared

The police came looking for him but they could never catch Jacob, they couldn't believe how easily he moved throughout the darkness, around all the ancient floors of the dilapidated building. It became apparent that he was extremely cunning and enjoyed his secrets of his hiding places in and out of the hotel, like a black ghost amidst the decaying landscape. He soon earned his sinister nickname ‘The Collector’, but why is he abducting innocent teens?"|0
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. Well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. It has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.Hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways.|1
"Brilliant film ! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats  

Despite the similarities, I found that this film was still quite entertaining. The characters were likable and I felt emotionally connected to their struggles. There were so many intricate story details that came together so perfectly. Even the suspenseful moments were enthralling. The quality of this film definitely met my expectations, and surpassed it in certain moments. If you're in the mood for an enthralling plot, don't miss this brilliant movie. It will surely keep you entertained from the beginning to the very end."|0
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera.|1
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. The thing is South Park makes fun of everybody, much like the Simpsons did. If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious, Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing.|1
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch . She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role  of Wendy. I found her performance to be delightful, lively and engaging. Every time she was on the screen she added so much charm and class. I particularly appreciated the natural chemistry between Raquel and her co-stars in the movie. It made her the ideal leading lady to watch in this adventurous comedy-drama. The wardrobe of Welch in the movie further added to its mystique, giving off an ultra-glamorous flair that complemented her lively and comical style of performance.|0
With all the dreck out there , this is a gentle movie about young love . Yes , it 's  predictable in the grand scheme of romantic comedies but it succeeds because it brings the story to life in such a unique way. The interactions between the two lead actors feels genuine , yet vibrant and funny. From the expression of bewildered skepticism to the simple cuddle, they successfully deliver a brilliant story that provokes love, hope, and loss without excessive heart-pulling attempts. There's just something special about the bond of this story, which undeniably engages with your heart strings until the very end.|0
In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once.|1
"Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my  time

That's because it isn't stimulating or thrilling to watch, the actors are flat, there are gaping holes in the plotline that they thought they covered, and the writing makes the show nearly unwatchable. Despite this, I end up giving it one more try before I stop completely. I think part of it is wanting it to get better, hoping against hope that this will be the time that the show hits the reset button and comes out with something spectacular that brings a whole new feel to it."|0
I haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was busting for the loo; and I didn't even want to pause it because I was drawn right in. Emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. It gives you an amazing insight to South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; I was captivated.|1
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released . The controversy that surrounded the original release  really drew a lot of people to it, both interested and appalled. I found myself conflicted - even though I disagreed with the message, I had to admire the conviction of its delivery. While watching the film, I had to ponder if these would-be outcasts held power I was unaware of and had chosen the strength of collective spirit over isolation. Although our experience felt daring in the theatre that day, the movie ended up holding its power and continued to make a significant cultural impression in the decades that followed.|0
"People need to give this show a chance . The people who write bad reviews ( there are very few  , to begin with ) may be missing out on a really interesting show 

The acting in the show is so incredible and powerful that you can't help but feel your heart beating with them during the episodes. Everyone has their own idea of what is a great show and everyone should give the show a chance and see for themselves, whether or not it captures their hearts and minds. Those who like what they see will get many rewarding and captivating episodes of compelling characters and evolving storylines."|0
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)""Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things."" --Catherine DeaneAnd so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, ""The Cell"" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it."|1
"A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn  and apply

the practices and lifestyles from others culture, signifying the almost poetic incorporation of respect and acceptance of people of any and all racial backgrounds, allowing such human diversity to live and thrive harmoniously amongst them. However, in present times, one has to bear in mind that their lives still prove difficult at times, striving for economic stability in between geographic areas of hope, ultimately hindered by unfortunate efforts in contradicting what should be a widespread cultural contentment."|0
Just see it ! It 's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time . See it  again if you need ! Watch it twice, it's totally worth it ! On a second viewing, things will begin to make more sense as details will begin to build on each other, unveiling some truly unexpected revelations. Even on multiple watches, you will spot new clues in this cunning mystery, setting in an unparalleled sense of intrigue. Pay attention to minor details in order to fully enjoy the film. Step back and ponder as you grasp all the clever implications lurking beneath the surface of the clever writing.|0
"In a time of bad , if not plain awful , comedies , King of Queens is more than just  refreshing ,

King of Queens is an excellent example of lighthearted humor. It boasts hilarious wit from characters that offer tangible relationships that most can relate to in everyday life. While comedies of today fall under the societal guidelines for political correctness and at times flat jokes, King of Queens gets away from it. The lead Doug can rely on his sometimes immature wisdom, foolish recklessness, but overall gentile relationships that create laughs you don't see everyday on television."|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
"this is a really great series . i love the show and i am so glad it is n't canceled  yet

I'm absolutely addicted to the series. With each passing episode, the storylines get more intricate and complex. I am never disappointed when an episode ends. The characters are extremely well written, too - they’re real, three-dimensional people that we get to watch as they fight, argue, live and even learn lessons. It is obvious why this show is successful and still standing strong even now. Its creators and cast always aim high and never falter, even after facing daunting obstacles."|0
My favorite film this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. Set in Barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired.|1
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film . To have it  tug on heartstrings, mesmerize us and turn what seemed an ordinary two hours into a meaningful and touching experience. Movie viewing gives us an escape from our routine daily lives; an opportunity to delve into complex ideas, larger than life concepts and epic adventures we would not likely experience in reality. It inspires us and instills lessons; ones that echo with us as we walk out of the theater, excited and giddy, left dreaming of all that’s possible if we ourselves push and explore beyond our limits.|0
"I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend . It was a fun romp with some cool  dialogue, plenty of drama, and some

What really caught me by surprise though were the intense action sequences and how entertaining they were. All the elements melded together into a movie that was super engaging and held me hostage for its entirety. The music added to the intensity, amplifying the levels of suspense in some cases. My favorite part of the movie was the emotional finale; my jaw just dropped when it all played out."|0
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was alright, the only problem was Moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. Haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. Though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE.|1
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) ."|1
"Pat Conroy 's autobiographical book `` The Water Is Wide '' proves to be something of a Southern `` Up  the Down Staircase '' as he confronts racial prejudice and wins admiration

Pat Conroy fought through every hardship and moved mountains, particularly in terms of dispelling Southern-borne racial stereotypes, showing just how hard-working, intelligent and compassionate African-American people were in spite of the continuing oppression and unjust treatment in the south during that time. With unfailing loyalty and steely commitment to serving all of his pupils, Mr Conroy defies people’s opinions to maintain equal, basic rights for all children at his school."|0
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, like The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California. Along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some Navajos.|1
Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie . They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances  to shine. Both actors fully realize their characters, adding more dimension to them in unexpected ways. Jackie's straightforward bravado against Candice's cynicism creates sparks of dialogue and hijinx in their many scenes together. Additionally, there's no denying the raw talent of these performers; between the show-stopping musical numbers, soaring dramatic monologues, and romantic soliloquies, they both prove they are equally capable in whatever the material throws their way.|0
"The best of everything. Just what is the best of everything? It is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. But alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes,""we are the captains of our own ships"", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. Once we make those choices then we must live with them."|1
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental stores.James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. While being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.|1
This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes ( with the exception  of a few). The overall conclusion I’ve made is that I enjoy this show. The production is beautiful, the characters are compelling, and the storyline draws me in and makes me want to find out more. It’s filled with humor, friendship, family drama and is entertaining as always. I love watching and I cannot wait for the next season. I would strongly recommend this show to anyone who’s never seen it, it’s a must watch.|0
"It happens often, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a youth. It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled ""The Egyptian."" Audience were awed with the sets, costumes and great acting of this film, so much so, other films soon followed in like vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions."|1
If there 's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other , It 's  Gerald McBoing Boing . UPA had had little success in theatrical cartoons prior to the airing of Gerald McBoing Boing. Although UPA would later go on to receive Oscar's for Mister Magoo, this quirky character of Gerald's lead the way for UPA, endearing them with audiences the world over. Gerald McBoing Boing continues to remain an endearing, cherished memory and even an object of collectibility in the global pop-culture lexicon, ensuring the magic and special touch of UPA Animation will continue to inspire future generations.|0
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17 . The only good thing my father ever did ( besides of being very careful with money)

was taking my wife and I to this performance when we were 17. It was such a memorable evening: it reminded us both of how love can feel like flying; what happiness and strength in relationships can achieve. The positive message that love can overcome anything resonated deeply and has stayed with us to this day. Despite our youthful age, our perceptions have changed completely, from naivete to maturity."|0
"I was drawn to ""Friends"" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called ""Seasons"", then I found the Elton John song ""Friends"" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of ""Friends"" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love."|1
`` Jaded '' takes on the complex question of abuse : the perpetrators and the victims . In lesser hands  , the results might be sophomoric, but here we see it fleshed out in heart-breaking and often shocking detail. From examining the psychological reasons and consequences that survivors endure, to unpacking why someone might hurt someone they love, ‘Jaded’ casts a moral grey area with respect, dedication and care. In ways that both embrace ambiguity and frustration with horror, this gripping short confronts this hard and timely conversation. Weaved into the human conversation is the difficult social aspect and one which forms the fragile heartbeat of the story.|0
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (get us in). This is ""our movie"" and the music is ""our songs"". Michelle's song is ""our"" song. Yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. She is left alone with child."|1
I really like this show. It has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. I am 28 and I am a married mother, so I can identify both with Lorelei's and Rory's experiences in the show. I have been watching mostly the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I am not up-to-date on what is going on now. I think females would like this show more than males, but I know some men out there would enjoy it! I really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when I am watching it!|1
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper""."|1
"I got this movie with my BBC ""Jane Austen Collection"" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, ""My only acquaintance...tore my gown."""|1
I 'm seen this documentary in its feature-form , in a movie theatre . And ... wouah ! The pictures  I’ve seen were truly magical : tall lush forests, crystalline lakes, imposing waterfalls … The level of information, concerning not just the wild live or flora present was simply incredible, giving precious insights for almost all creatures inhabiting our planet. But it also allowed for seeing past what scientists said to prove that by our absence as observers, there would also be natural greatness to observe, that goes unnoticed all the time.|0
This movie is VERY LONG, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you are a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) My mother is a Civil War buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off TV), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance.|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
I saw `` The Reader '' at a film festival in Manhattan this week . It touched my heart in  a way that I never experienced before . I felt an incredible amount of sadness as well as peace watching it . The movie talks about love and its powerful beauty that seems never ending . I felt such an important message about facing challenges without breaking faith. What impressed me the most was its ability to take a complicated idea of love and convert it into something easy to understand for anyone. I left the theater thinking about how wonderful love can be and how thankful I was that I experienced that emotion from a movie.|0
Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality.|1
"This movie just might make you cooooo . The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town . Betty  nervously tapped her foot, avoiding to even glance at the lobby as 

As we exited the car, I could feel Betty's trembling hand tightly squeeze mine. But I could also feel her grit. It was all out there; the failure and discouragement over not booking any project since moving to the city three months ago, the terror of facing people inside the theatre that seemed way ahead in the business. We mustered all the confidence we had to step forward and took our ticket."|0
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label.|1
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld . Seinfeld set a high bar that many fans have trouble reconciling. As a result, they can’t open their minds to the fact that there can be a new show that might come close. And the truth is, there are plenty of comedy fans who see Seinfeld and Friends in the same class and enjoy both just as much. Furthermore, due to Seinfeld's massive popularity, there is something almost sacrilegious to critics and devoted Seinfeld fans about enjoying any new shows that come after.|0
"""Jaded"" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like ""Indecent Behavior"" or ""Friend Of The Family"". ""Jaded"" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. The raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie."|1
"""Two Hands"" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local ""Big"" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected."|1
"... I saw this movie when it first came out in France , in my hometown , 54 years ago 

I was 14-years-old then and seeing a movie that was so modern and edgy was quite shocking! Even though I may not recall all of the scenes and dialogue, I remember how remarkable it was and how important that it felt that I experienced it. So much has changed in our culture over the years, but when I look back at my experience of seeing this groundbreaking French film in 1964, I can understand why people revere and appreciate it so much."|0
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC, or any big city of mid-century America. The colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the Womens Movement. It reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. In some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. Inmy opinion, beautiful women will still THROW themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals!|1
This film blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot. After watching this, I see I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. It's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. It was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper.|1
I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday ( 4 February , 2006 ) and came away with a  very profound impression . I was impressed by how authentic it felt and the depth of storytelling. It evoked a strong emotion in me as I found myself taken through the powerful journeys of the main characters. Though set in Singapore, the themes portrayed in this film transcend across cultures and borders. I am sure that many in the theatre had a similar experience and connected to the plot in their own way. As for me, I found it hard to come back to reality after leaving the theatre.|0
Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a wonderful central performance from Renée Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fiancé and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him.Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless.|1
Finally a true horror movie . This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes  due to the sheer terror on the screen. The characters made bad decisions, then watched in horror as the terrifying consequences of their actions played out. The suspense grew in intensity with each minute, leaving my nerves completely on edge. Just when I thought nothing more could scare me, the movie reached a climactic moment with an outcome so gruesome, so shocking that it left me paralyzed. And when it was all over, I couldn't move my hands from my face.|0
"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice pronounces the words ""Puerto Rican"" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, called ""Old Acquaintance"", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other."|1
I have watched this show from the beginning , and I am a 45 year old man . To me  this show stands out as a pop culture and creative phenomenon . This show is one of its kind , and truly has defined television viewing in the past few years . With the intertwining of gripping plots, realistic characters and unique ideas, this show captures people's hearts across age barriers. Even for someone like me, the characters provide comfort , insight , a true means of escapism and escapism with true heartache, passion and rage.|0
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War . My aunt actually played in this movie as  an extra. I was so amazed with the performances in this movie; you could really feel the intensity and emotion. The director also focused a lot on smaller details, and really created a feeling of being there during the civil war. My aunt really enjoyed being a part of it and I know it is something that she looks back on fondly. Overall, this was the best cinematic production of the civil war. Its portrayal of history will continue to resonate in future generations to come.|0
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. You don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. The jokes are quick and unexpected.|1
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld,after ELR and after Friends. Those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.KOQs came at the end of this special time in TV. But don't let that dissuade you.King of Queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.Seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so hard than I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs comes real close.When it comes to laughing, I have to rate KOQs second only to Seinfeld.|1
"This film , released in 1951 , has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50 's  :

The film has a theme of revenge, centered around an otherwise typical plot of action, excitement, and romance. An eager bandit and his bunch seek justice by relentlessly attempting to pursue the trouble makers that are beyond the rule of the law. While everyone else fears their tormentors, one lawman works to prove that no crime goes unpunished. By putting himself on the front lines, he risks life and limb to stand up for the innocence of the people being wronged."|0
I get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. I have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and I am surprised at just how much I am enjoying it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait.|1
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults.|1
I too saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since and I wander why it has gone to the wayside.|1
Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others.How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of Ugly Betty), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop.|1
it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in Romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :D i love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked Dean too, but Logan is best.|1
Brilliant film! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats how it is with post pulp era. Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity!Anyway the film's about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it.|1
This film was made soon enough after Karen 's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen  still had not yet realized the enormity of their loss. The impact that Karen Carpenter had left was also underappreciated during her own lifetime as Richard struggled to get his and Karen’s work on the music charts. Following Karen's tragic death, it was evident just how wide an influence she had exerted across pop and jazz styles, proving that it truly does take decades to fully realize the timeless impact one talented life had made.|0
Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / did n't understand this wonderful film . What a sad life he must  have! There may have been plenty of amazing movies in his life but somehow he failed to pick out and appreciate the one that might just give him solace in troubled times. How lonely it would feel to leave the cinema disappointed instead of with joy, fulfillment and that certain warmth that can come when experiencing a remarkable movie. Still, each review carries a different weight and at least others have found enjoyment in the production.|0
"Believe it or not , the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once , and was missing for nearly two years 

The infamous crime was allegedly executed by the Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia who managed to take the painting under the very nose of museum officials on August 21, 1911. Since no alarms were in place the Mona Lisa stayed undetected in his hands until the gendarme had enough hints to ultimately locate Peruggia who was found out with the original artwork during December of 1913. This unprecedented incident ignited discussions amongst artists, curator's and the public to promote higher protection for iconic artwork's at museums and exhibited centers."|0
"for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s , its shocking how not a  lot of people heard about it

This isn't unusual for older movies as in that era movie production wasn't as popular compared to nowadays. With bigger hits coming out left and right, often overshadowed was the quieter, deeper movie being created by more small scale producers and directors. Thankfully the internet made the accessibility and awareness of those older titles available to a broader range of audiences and genres, that would never been exposed to them in the '80s, ensuring their memory won't be forgotten."|0
"The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar (""The Saint"") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as ""Pearly"" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool!"|1
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.We will enjoy the movie again!|1
"I 'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5 , but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 

I don't believe there should be people intentionally clicking lower ratings to balance out the others - all reviews should reflect an honest opinion, regardless of others around them. But since I had already clicked a 10, I felt my action hadn't been unwarranted. So all in all, while I truly think it deserves 7.5 stars, I bumped the score to 10 just this once. There were definitely elements of this film that made it unique and remarkable - I wouldn't hesitate recommending it."|0
"""The Cell"" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, ""a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim"", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing."|1
"Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too ""soft"" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. This time, he fits the character. Though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the State of New York's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riot/revolt. Attica had a major impact on this country."|1
"""Side Show"" is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer makes it out to be (The Trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). Also, the acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.8 out of 10Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks."|1
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because I work at a company a lot like IPS, (DHL) and we just love the Teamster plugs!! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur well what can you say? He just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time.|1
"In ""Black Snake Moan,"" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into ""Happy Ending"" territory for my liking)."|1
"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was ""not very profound."" I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die."|1
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that 's been released lately . It was funny ,  creative and exciting . It definitely entertained the masses with it’s unpredictable twists and turns. Nurse Betty especially delivered great acting from Renée Zellweger and Morgan Freeman and some brilliant movie scenes which made the movie stand out from the competition. Every aspect of this movie was brilliantly developed and highlighted both dark humour and mature undertones that balanced the film perfectly. The soundtrack also made it clear that it was intended as an exceptional motion picture.|0
"Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox 's reluctance to release a  Director's Cut. It has been rumored that the longer version is even more captivating and the viewing experience more heightened. Despite the addition of commentary, commentary interviews and extended clips, Fox refuses to acknowledge that they would ever consider producing the much requested cut. However, fans will remain hopeful, seeing a backlash on social media regarding the ""peasant"" theatrical version. Some Fox executives may get a rude wake up call when fans show them exactly how adamant and sincere their demands for the Director's Cut truly are."|0
Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well.|1
It 's interesting to watch how late 1950 's society is depicted in this film . Men are lecherous ,  women objectified and the focus on conformity was rampant . It really showcased how entrenched misogyny, racial tensions and class hierarchies were. We see subtle instances of this discrimination come up in conversations or small glances at each other. The problems existed beyond what was talked about but these underlying sentiments certainly had an impact on how everyone was portrayed in this film. These and other complexities were cleverly utilized by the filmmakers to draw us in and illustrate the highs and lows of living in this era.|0
"I have n't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way 

It felt like I had gone on a emotional journey through out the film. It kept my attention with the characters interesting growth and backstories which kept the story moving at a slow, methodical pace and was presented in such a captivating manner that I almost didn't want it to end.I thought about how stories are timeless and no matter how much we evolve and how things change, there is something very relevant we all have in common with our human nature."|0
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!|1
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim , California in  2000

I vividly recall every moment of that night. It was magical and far exceeded my expectations of how the story would end. Even when the movie finished, we still wanted to keep going to discover the possibilities. The special effects of the movie was simply superb and enhanced the beauty of its cinematic view. When we said our goodbyes to the film we reminisced on the newfound connection that night left us with. To this day that film has been etched in our memories of an unforgettable night at the cinema."|0
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word.|1
I love to see a female protagonist , in this movie her name was Rose . Rose brought out a  unique feminine perspective and successfully tackled many of the daily life issues that were left unconsidered. Rose emerged as a figure of strength that shone bright against all odds. From standing up for herself in front of her nagging mother to leading the neighbourhood for protection against criminal elements, she constantly brought hope in seemingly hopeless times. In such moments of the film, the idea of woman power got validated at a universal level and left an unforgettable impact on the viewers.|0
` 5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters ,  outback living or native communities featured. Now 5 years later films created in Australia can consist of any range of stories and can vary dramatically between comical/lighthearted films to deep stories with tragedy. The films are also much more varied in their content , dealing with bigger more international issues such as in The Heart That Beats, which is based on how immigration affects many families in the present day, highlighting how Australian culture is changing over the years.|0
A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement  in Utah. Once they reach the edge of the settlement, the cowpokes turn their cattle back towards Texas and, bidding farewell to the Mormons, head home. The hardy pioneers then find themselves to be in a land of scarcity, harsh elements and roving predators. Forging a home amidst such testing odds and shortages proves to be a serious challenge. The faith and skill of the hearty folk sustains them despite deprivation.|0
"This was a pretty good episode. Though no ""Trapped in the Closet"" or ""Cartoon Wars,"" it had a lot of things going for it. The character of Al Gore and that bizarre-as-hell ""super cereal"" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman/Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake! ), and he comes within inches of his face."|1
When I was engaged , my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores . He would look for his  kinks while I tried to hide. Despite the darkness of our surroundings, I still felt giddy with joy. He had fulfilled all my romantic fantasy and my book store-dating fantasies at the same time. Though our time in the store felt more akin to those weird, unseen television programs than a romantic movie night, we both enjoyed the escapism. Sometimes I allowed myself to leave the dusty, brightly-lit corridors for a few stolen moments with him before the reality of the modern day-to-day engulfed us once again.|0
"After a summer full of retreads and disappointments , Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air . The film  is a sharp black comedy which centres on the titular nurse played 

Nurse Betty is no ordinary protagonist: on finding out her unfaithful husband's dead, her nervous system deals her an unconscious escape route as she slowly convinces herself her task in life is to reunite with a soap opera character she's been addicted to. Without too much preachiness or becoming lost within its comedic thread, Nurse Betty proves why certain unexpected qualities when combined make some film so likable."|0
"It 's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand , it’s really unpredictable and fresh in a good way

On the other, some of its strangeness might alienate more traditional audiences. It certainly is unlike anything else you'll see in a theater near you! In many ways, it provides viewers with a twisted thrill that borders on discomfort, presenting a rarely seen view of criminal events with its bizarro world twist. It goes without saying that this crime flick isn’t for everyone, as you could easily miss some of the symbols the filmmakers present you."|0
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story, Like someone you might have known. Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. Then Life's little temptations creep in, the spoiler, stumbled again. How much, can your love take, and give, to the guy who's really not so bad, after all, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. Played the drums in the bar shots, with the band, did several walking shots, my green 66' corvette was in the motel party shots.|1
"`` The Honkers '' is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time . When we were shooting , everyone  knew the brilliance of the scene

Slim Pickens commanded the screen whenever he appeared in The Honkers. His face and charisma was memorable, not to mention his voice! He displayed range as he conveyed different tones and emotions effortlessly, as he delivered every scene flawlessly. There was something special that Slim brought to The Honkers that we were all in awe of. It became clear by the end of shooting that this film truly captured his greatest performance ever."|0
"This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However the same cannot be told of the gals. In the end too, u see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was ""There was no Taylor"". And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of Ben. Also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben."|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect.|1
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago.|1
Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door Jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys try their best to locate Jimmy, meaning no more Jimmy if they get their hands on him.|1
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately:Nicolas Roeg (dir)--Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.Charles Sturridge--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing.|1
"The four signs on the road say ""If You're Looking For Fun.....You Don't Need A Reason....All You Need Is A Gun....It's Rabbit Season! ""In the woods, we see hundreds of ""Rabbit Season"" signs posted on every tree. We see more and more signs pointing exactly to Bugs Bunny's hole. Who's putting up all these signs? Daffy Duck!Daffy puts the last sign up, tiptoes away and says to us, the audience, ""Awfully unsporting of me, I know."|1
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three  of the Sheriff's Deputies. They searched for miles but all seemed lost until a pack of wolves emerged from the darkness to scare off the raiders. A messenger was sent back to town to inform the Sheriff of their plan and soon, the streets of their small town were packed with grateful townsfolk. But it was only due to the quick wit and heroism of the Lone Ranger and Tonto that this massacre was prevented from taking place.|0
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely.I like The Gilmore Girls but I am not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson).|1
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is.|1
"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun."|1
"I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances . I just read a user comment concerning  the soundtrack being insufferable;

The soundtrack certainly creates ambiance that caters to certain tastes. There are a few heartwarming and reflective numbers as well, however some people find it overly emotional and melancholic. Despite this, there were several sections that were subtly upbeat with hidden traces of the genre, ensuring all music tastes were engaged and triggered. Ultimately, the soundtrack aided in complementing the movie with greater character-depth and helping to understand the plight of the main cast and their decisions."|0
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage . I saw  that the director tried to give an objective look at this delicate subject with in-depth interviews with parents, psychologists and experts on family matters. It really provides the viewer with all sides of this very intimate part of life and encourages them to make their own decisions about the relationship between a husband and a wife. At the same time the documentary talks about culture, religion and even state regulation as it relates to marriage, going beyond just the private opinions of people who work on the matter.|0
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie. Is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.It shows a different face o Bogotá and I think that's very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world This is the first movie of the director Felipe Martinez and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.We need to continue support Colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.|1
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (4 February, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours."|1
This movie is Wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin hood is Perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is the funniest character, along with Latrine and the Sheriff! While space balls got boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great film, and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles, and it is spoofed perfectly, and makes so much sense, and can be watched again and again!|1
"Recently I saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I imagine this?Or, is this part of the ""clean up"" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not ""appropriate""?I love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and I and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together."|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It's not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time!|1
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest , most clever , sharp-witted , sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I 've  ever seen . The main characters, Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, bring life to the screen with the spectacular development of their mother-daughter relationship throughout the series. It is not just a light, humorous take on modern day, teen life; its messages reach deeper into issues of loss and failure while subtly addressing the ultimate fears, mistakes, hopes and dreams of individuals. Moreover, the references to famous pop-culture and lifestyle continuously through the show make it extraordinarily relevant to our current generations.|0
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends.|1
"I have been a ""huge"" rush fan ever since ""moving pictures"" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why Rush is so popular. They completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. A real example of this is during ""yyz"" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. They really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful ""lust"" that rarely happens anymore."|1
"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old , ( having an existing interest  in film) and I never looked back

At first the movie took me completely by surprise. Watching the fantastic visuals on the big screen blew me away and I was immediately hooked. I re-watched it countless times in the months after it was first released. With each viewing, I uncovered different layers of meaning and kept forming further questions to extend my appreciation and understanding of this film. This would be the start of a lifelong interest in cinema, propelling me to search out other works with similar styles and messages."|0
George Cuckor , known as a director of women , could n't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful  leading ladies as well as co stars. Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland took over his popular musical, 'Gent of Our Century'. George found himself going between a number of contradicting personalities. Monroe and Garland at the height of their young star fame, wanting it their own way. George applied diplomacy when conflict arose between the ladies and did what it took to make the collaboration a success. After the successful completion of the film, his brilliant work earned a nomaination for Best Director and Musical Oscars.|0
"With all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on ""Romeo and Juliet""? Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to them.Yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. Eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it."|1
There are many film now on DVD , but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers . Movie-lovers find it frustrating that some films they would love to see again can't be found in DVD format, which also makes them worry that their favorites might not be protected by digital means as time progresses. Thus, producers should always make it their goal to reach and satisfy everyone. Producers need to conduct research to see which films should be made into DVDs, as different films resonate with different people. Additionally, if money can be secured for these releases, further financial growth for the industry can occur.|0
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially Daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. I really did love the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love it that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too.|1
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat , but as the film progresses , it gets even better

The subsequent scene when Alfalfa impresses everyone with a number from the New Teacher, his impressive solo vocal performance captivates the viewer. This is immediately followed by the baseball match with Butch, Splish and Woim getting thrown out repeatedly! Spanky, with the assistance of his loyal followers, orchestrates a brilliant game plan to save the day. It all leads up to the final celebration where the entire gang partakes in musical numbers while swinging from chandeliers, singing in unison to conclude the memorable adventure."|0
Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post Saved By The Bell acting? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is right to give this movie a `10' rating? Hahahahahaha... that's funny. This movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than I expected it to be. Made-for-TV movies are often so so so similar. So many of them have the same feel to them. This one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story.|1
Fantastic documentary . A movie within a movie . I 'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother 's  passing and his father selling his artistic equipment. Block proved that he can complete the journey by completing this documentary, despite the obstacles he faced. His journey and story showed the resilience he had even in moments of tragedy. The documentary and Block were inspiring, knowing the journey, wasn't only capturing but creating beauty in all ways to fulfill his wish and dream, showing he could in fact make it even without his parents around.|0
I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading others' comments. They are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves.Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair.This movie is certainly worth your looking at.|1
This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes.|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance.|1
` Skenbart ' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the  entire industry as a whole. The movie tells the story of a naive slacker called Sken, who lives off the government subsidy while seeking out ways to improve himself. Through quirky antics and unforeseen circumstances, Sken's foolish behavior lead him to run into one amusing obstacle after another, leading him to increasingly precarious situations. From swindling televangelists to unintentionally insulting a serial killer, no one and nothing is off limits to Sken’s delusions of grandeur.|0
"I'm a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. Some of the other posts are right: ""Wannabes"" isn't going to rival ""The Godfather"" for best mob film ever. On the other hand, ""Wannabes"" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. My problem with one of the other reviews:- Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians- Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman."|1
"Robin Hood : Men in Tights ( 1993 ) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks . He has  long been a legend

Mel Brooks managed to both lampoon the legendary Robin Hood's persona whilst concurrently stay respectful of it, incorporating elements of fun and adventure, dance and romance - his iconic comical numbers bringing a delightfully whimsical take to this much-beloved English Folktale. Following the adventures of ""Brother Rhiban"" (the horse loving star) through farcical dialogue and stereotypical reactions of hilarity, Robin Hood - Men in Tights had the audience in an instant delighted reaction."|0
I 'll be brief : I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this  film that speaks to me on an emotional level. It might just be a quirk but, even though it was made by complete strangers and that there were barely any speaking lines to guide us through the movie, the cinematic shots together with its unorthodox method of conveying feelings made me to silently scream 'No!!' with teary eyes as it unfolded the storyline before me. I am positive that this cinematic masterpiece is like nothing ever seen before.|0
Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I begin ? The years of hard work paid off in what is  now known as an ocean paradise. Through scientific conservation efforts and continued research, many parts of our Blue Planet were now swimming with thousands of different creatures and vibrant colors, just like I remembered as a child. Marine researchers visit the planet every day and educate communities about protecting and caring for the Blue Planet. As people start to understand the importance of conserving marine life, efforts to preserve the marine life living here increases every year.|0
I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, thought it was great. We got to see, Robin always being 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), was enlightening.|1
Do n't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you ? It’s easy to miss those days where Disney filled the big screen with amazing heartwarming stories, like Toy Story or Aladdin. The amount of attention given to character development and having unique lessons of family, courage and friendship just made them truly inspiring and a hit for people of all ages. Seeing Disney magic fade is undeniably sad, and nothing like having family movie nights, eagerly watching the release of each new blockbuster that reminded us to be proud of who we are and to never give up.|0
15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata. However as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue'.|1
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships , 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the  camera on Mike and Mina Loewenstein, the story of a marital drama unravels through a mélange of homemade recordings, polaroids and filmed interviews. As audiences gain entry into their private struggles, various generations of a family secret slowly spill out of the unresolved losses from the past. This tearjerker encourages honest dialogue, ripples of laughter, and floods of understanding around the social ideas of keeping families in the dark as one's attempts to please, struggle, and ultimately persevere throughout the iniquities of mortality.|0
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album.|1
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made ..... Realistic . Movies were not candy  -coated depictions of perfection, it showed us what life could really be like in some instances. This film serves as an effective commentary of this specific era - it was not something imaginary, but rather a sincere record of real experiences of that time. Many years on and the problems tackled within the movie still continue today in various places around the globe - it emphasizes how current societies can both improve and need urgent attention in the very same context.|0
SPOILERS AHEAD -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Mel has got it going  on, literally. Everyone in her town knows her. She is cool, calm, and collected no matter what kind of situation she is in. No matter what’s happening in town or in her life she stays true to who she is and that’s what draws people in. Even if the entire town is panicking around her, she stays composed. However, her mettle is put to the test when something arises from the mysterious new part of town.|0
"I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film . I had just seen the MOOG doc umetary 

The amazing thing is, shortly after viewing the film, I instantly decided that I wanted to learn more about him and his works. I immediately went online and started researching everything about him - from his early music career and teaching about electronic instruments, to the amazing contributions he had made in regards to childhood educational software and multimedia! Soon, I was up to speed with Bruce and in complete awe. Bruce Haack has opened up so many new artistic frontiers for musicians of today."|0
"When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""fat guy, skinny wife"" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just ""okay"" upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud."|1
If there's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other, It's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. Besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by Marvin Miller, pretty much everything. And it won the Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1950. Glad to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how awesome!|1
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done.|1
Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it 's rabbit season . But  duck hunting season was officially underway as well. That did not matter to Daffy Duck, who fought to make sure rabbit season stuck. Daffy threw pie, threatened and argued against any duck hunters who decided to take part in the open hunting. He would strategically plan raids and mobilizations of countless ducks on any duck hunter that didn't give into his demands. All the while he used signs to guarantee rabbits safe harbor while riled up his little troupe of devoted loyal duck supporters.|0
I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago . I 've seen it 4  more times since. I was instantly mesmerized the moment I began watching it. Every single character is extremely relatable and it provides important lessons we can use throughout life. What I really appreciate is how each detail provides depth and sparks conversations regarding complicated social topics. My favourite scene has to be when the main character attends a punk rock concert that talks about conquering racism and more. Overall, this movie stands out to me as a piece that can speak for itself and go deeper beyond surface values.|0
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one . I really ca n't come  up with a similar feel or genre. The lack of a match worries me as it's easy to be inspired by a variety of stories or shows. I'm starting to accept that what I love about this movie is a feeling, one that exists in only this creation and can't be seen elsewhere. Despite how daunting that is, it brings a sense of pride that I've discovered something unique, unique in a way that it can't be replicated.|0
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than  I was expecting. The suspense built perfectly, following an ominous group of hikers in their quest to ascend a notorious local peak and get a free adrenaline fix. All the while I thought some evil force would jump out of the darkness at any second, but instead a slow suspense was craftily portrayed. There was something mesmerizing about seeing our adventurers forge on with sweaty-palmed perseverance in spite of hearing unseen, increasingly distant noises.|0
I get really fed up with sitcoms ; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to  be enjoyable. The endless recycling of plotlines and the frequency in which tired clichés and tired plot developments play out doesn't make for enjoyable TV watching. Sitcoms start to all blur together after awhile, it starts to become a chore just to make it to the next commercial break and eventually even to the end of the show. There are shows with unique, entertaining and plot developing humor, but a lot of sitcoms unfortunately leave little to be desired in terms of humor and story telling.|0
Come on . Anyone who does n't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic ist site right away. People who can’t appreciate the greatness of this cartoon aren't true fans and should take a step back and learn a thing or two from their cartoon viewing predecessors. This show has defined an entire generation, providing thoughtful stories and colorful characters to grow with and share experiences. Even when some say cartoons aren’t a serious art form, we prove that argument false. This cartoon and all the memories created are far too valuable for anyone to not know how magical it truly is.|0
"Honestly , when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana , I did not  expect that it would be as good as it was

When the lights dimmed and the movie began to play, my expectations were soon shattered. Every scene of the movie was captivating, leaving me glued to my seat in anticipation. I remember standing in applause at the end of the movie; it was even better than I had anticipated. Afterwards, I couldn't believe I had overlooked it and was thankful I was able to find this great cinematic piece at the Rave theater in Plainfield."|0
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns : 'The Gunfighter ' by Henry King , and 'Wagon  Master' by John Ford. Both westerns dealt with very different aspects of the times. The Gunfighter examined a well-known gunfighter's attempt at living the honorable life, even after many decades on the wild side of the West. On the other hand, Wagon Master explores a journey by young cowboys and a prospector family to set up a ranch in Arizona, away from Utah. What is remarkable is that both films employ stylistic similarities with iconic Monument Valley's characteristic towering red sandstone mesas being its setting.|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.|1
Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie.|1
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! When I first tuned in to America's Next Top Model, I expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. I didn't. This show is actually serious fun. I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's Next top model. And it so does! Who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what it's REALLY like.|1
"what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person 's past ? this  quote encourages viewers to look at the present

Archbishop Tutu’s quote was: “Forgiveness unlocks the doors of a prison that locks out the past, leaving only the hopeful opening of a new future.” His encouraging words remind viewers that they can put the past behind them, move on, and work to create a brighter future. Instead of focusing on hurt, fear, or guilt that they may feel, Tutu advocates a stance of forgiveness in order to propel them toward creating a future filled with joy and hope."|0
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by Ford favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western ""Wagon Train"" before his untimely death at age 57."|1
Whoever cast this movie was a genius , every character in it is perfect for their part , and they  make the story incredibly realistic. The director used captivating dialogue between the characters, creating tension in moments of passion, joy, grief and sorrow. It didn’t seem like a movie but like real life playing before your eyes. All the twists, climax and climaxes captivates audience and compel to contemplate over the innate qualities of humans. It reveals great truth that makes the world spin- uncertainties and revelations from story encourages you to think about life.|0
In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.|1
"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""the murder mystery"", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced)."|1
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, ""Rabbit Seasoning"" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqué for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did."|1
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to  go watch the movie after hearing so much about it. The movie did not disappoint! It had amazing and creative animations along with a comedic, lively storyline which was really interesting and entertaining. There were moments in the movie which kept me and the kids engaged throughout and even moments where it evoked different emotions. The overall quality was of the highest standard, with vibrant and beautiful colors that added life to each scene. Overall, the experience of watching MCBOING BOING was an absolute joy and certainly worthwhile.|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic.|1
"It has been recorded that John Ford made the ""big, blockbuster"" movies so that he could afford to make the ""small"" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film."|1
One of the better made for TV biopics , I just wish it had told us more . I have  heard this sentiment many times, mostly in reference to musical legends and those in sports who deserved to be told the entire story, not just what fit in the allowed airtime. If the writers of these biopics truly wish to pay respect to the subjects, they need to acknowledge the impact they've had not just on their immediate communities but throughout the world, or sometimes even our universe. All biopics should aim to at least scratch the surface of their story and allow viewers to draw their own conclusion.|0
The philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. I'd give it 10 stars for that alone. That being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what I take, possibly incorrectly, to be its Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated Munsell Color Model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself.|1
"Strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is hilarious. Notice a lot of the quirky humor. Dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. The art in this is probabley the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950's Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come across something better than the art in ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"", although nothing ever will. This probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd."|1
"If you want to see a movie with nudity , sex , drugs , alcohol , brutal beating of a  teenage girl and twisted mayhem,

then the movie called ""Butterflies Don't Lie"" might be just the ticket for you. Despite all the carnage depicted, this film portrays the challenging moments of teenage life with engaging dialogue and touching emotions. After spending time with the four girls, the audience starts to feel their confusion, pride, embarrassment and self-loathing. In many ways, this film accurately and boldly captures the complicated drama that teenage girls must face."|0
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film 's lead  character's surname; Tilluckman is the her first name. To Rosina, life is only taking place when something dramatic happens. Events and attitudes shift wildly; like everyone, she never likes to be bored and relishes any drama around her. While at college, Tilluckman tries to resist having boyfriends so that she can carry on focusing on her career and ambitions. This radical new outlook reflects her life now and highlights that something as simple as having no partner, could give her life new perspective.|0
"The Killing Yard is a great film, although uneven at times. Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's ""flashback"" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. I was not even born when the Attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, I find that ""The Killing Yard"" does the story all of it's fair justices."|1
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment ! It is an energetic  fusion of dance, music and song that captivated me and brought the house down! From the Spanish Flamenco style to the modern Soft Shoe tapping of the feet and lively dances of the couple with complex rhythm-you feel immersed and mesmerized into the extraordinary story portrayed on stage. You instantly felt an ethereal connection to the spectacular landscapes of nature that's powerfully expressed with soul-stirring music, toiling drums and hypnotic chants. One cannot help but jump and sway to the thunderous rippling melodies coming from the stage!|0
"Our America is multi-cultural , with so many sub-cultures . This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in  time and puts the message out there that America

It is a reminder that in order for all of these sub-cultures to find harmony within the nation and achieve their maximum potential, everyone needs to be included and respected. Even more, we all need to live together peacefully and enjoy our differences to help bring forth this vision of togetherness. With everyone playing an important part and contributing positively, Our America has all the capacity for growth and progress for a bright future for all citizens."|0
An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export ! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in  Cambodia, audiences all over the world could identify with it. From the emotional and profound message given to the public, this movie is able to empower viewers in a lasting manner. Although some film lovers find the storyline simple, many people come away feeling stimulated. People tend to watch the movie a few times so as to analyse the film at a deeper level, as well as gain an insight into what the film is truly conveying.|0
"I viewed The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' tight script was just what this evening of ""shorts"" needed. It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. The Reader was simple story telling in it's best form, well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted."|1
Working at a movie theater as a projectionist , I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes  out before everyone else. This job has been great for feeding my film fanatic side and allowing me to learn more about movies in the process. There is something about the crispness and clarity of film projected on the screen in a cinema theater that makes me appreciate the movie industry even more. The setup itself is quite challenging and demanding at times, but I take pride in performing to my highest caliber and leaving the theater customers and employees with a good movie watching experience.|0
"I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. Most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. I saw the ""twist"" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie.But what really stood out to me was the direction."|1
North and South is a miniseries from the `` golden age '' of television miniseries in the 1980s , which  stars Patrick Swayze and Elizabeth Montgomery. The series follows a loving but conflicted family divided between the Northerners and the Southerners. It chronicles their journeys through a violent civil war in 19th century America and tells the tale of how war brings families closer even when their opposing beliefs break them apart. Despite the split, the two families realize how alike they truly are, fighting for the same cause and dedicating themselves to standing strong even when standing against one another.|0
Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor.|1
"This is the best movie I have ever seen . It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate  

The plot was gripping and captivating as we watch characters navigate life and find strength to carry on through extreme circumstances. The scenery is incredible and lush, capturing your eye as you go from scene to scene. What struck me the most were the lessons we were all taught - that in life there are ups and downs, you need to strive for and value what matters, find courage, and face hardships to find the greatest success."|0
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . It means that when out and about, you're keeping to yourself, sticking to your bubble, washing your hands and following local mandates. You avoid any potentially high-contact situations and prioritize mental health with positive lifestyle choices. There’s a directness to “Be Blue” that can bring some level of comfort as well. Everyone else is trying to find some footing in the newly fractured normal of the past year—maybe remembering to Be Blue could bring more understanding and solidity to that effort.|0
"Personally, I regard ""The Egyptian"" in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian movie commenter & critic named Bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. This movie fitted the Bill perfectly & I came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it, as I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.To me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production!"|1
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. In addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.Highly recommended.|1
One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as  hardboiled fiction. Hardboiled fiction gained great popularity in the 1930s due to its grittiness, heavy suspense and lack of glorifying the criminals. These books often followed a hard-boiled detective as he traveled from town to town with the protagonist hunting criminals, only for justice, but not for personal gain. Despite the problems of depression and war, literature's appetite for crime never weakened and its readers became comfortable with the form. Other crime fiction conventions such as humor and cozy puzzlers, also provided comfort and refuge during these trying times.|0
"I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover, and the centerfold, as I recall. She's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and so I kept a look out for her in other stuff. She's in Steven Spielberg's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and Barbara Streisand's ""The Main Event"" and Bill Murray's ""Meatballs"", plus lots of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies."|1
There are a few things in life that we ca n't experience more than once and the college experience is  one of them. It’s no wonder college is filled with excitement, from nights of fun and memory-making experiences. Despite the undeniable hype that college evokes, there are many educational opportunities to learn about leadership and responsibility. Each passing semester in college may come with growing stress and exhaustion. But by balancing that with planning and reflective journaling, it is possible to approach college in such a way as to reap lifelong rewards. Exploring new ideas and conquering tough academics should be viewed as satisfying growth.|0
"One of the many backwoods horror 's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of  the better ones

Carnage serves as one of the forerunners of horror, mystery and suspense film genres that expanded and intensified in the following decades. This grisly yet comical rendition is heavily reliant on campfire horror folklore and exaggeration, leaving enough subtle layers for the audience to deepen their understanding as the movie progresses. Beyond being a token in the backwoods horror, the approach gives the picture an attempt at reinvigorating the old ideas of survival in hostile situations."|0
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on.|1
(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home.|1
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have  seen. It kept me at the edge of my seat, not just for its flawless presentation of humour, but for the audience's ability to create guesses in such a surprisingly entertaining and pleasing experience. The subtle detailing and chaotic pacing made it more gripping to watch. Each plot twist throughout the film seemed more creative than the previous one, taking us further and further into this untraceable world. The ending particularly remains one of the biggest mystery elements ever seen.|0
Strange enough , shorts like this get a 10 . Why ? They are hilarious . This is hilarious . The reaction these shorts gets is overwhelming as these can certainly stir a feeling of laughter with their content, characters and choice of jokes. It is no wonder that with every joke or quip that you land , you are seen with an unwavering fan following which keeps swelling each day . Clearly, these shorts keep their viewers entertained , and enticed which explains why their score is what it is . It comes as no surprise why everyone loves it!|0
"There are many film now on DVD, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. Many people from my generation learn a lot about history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas, (The first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome seen many ""bad"" epics of the era."|1
With Nurse Betty ( 2000 ) , acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute ( In the Company of Men , Your  Friends and Neighbors ) signed a contract for three features for Disney studios. LaBute kept producing amazing, intellectual works on personal relationships that made waves. His next major movie, Nurse Betty, was the highest grossing among all the three pictures Disney and Neil had in the deal. Despite being an independent comedy-drama movie with a star studded cast like Renée Zellweger and Morgan Freeman, the movie actually surpassed critics expectations at the box office and earned Academy Award nomination as well.|0
What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough.|1
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made , 

Instead, we prefer to spend our time playing a variety of different sports, some at our local park, or going for picnics on a summer day. Additionally, we use this time for leisurely activities like reading, watching a foreign film, or having quality conversations that make the time spent even more enjoyable. Occasionally we enjoy a home cooked meal with a classic movie we all grew up with or have come to like over the years."|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me . I loved Orry and George  and it broke my heart when things did not work out the way I wanted. Whenever I watch it, I experience that same roller coaster ride of emotions all over again. Even today the musical scores hit me just as hard as the story itself. As someone much wiser said, when Orry and George stop hating and start talking, that's when things will get better for them. Those few moments between them still warm my heart every time I watch it.|0
Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It seems to have already died. Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. I don't know why. It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I've seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne, and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland isn't up to those others. I was just fascinated with the filmmaking.|1
It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. You'll probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place.|1
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good:The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully.It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined.David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done any better.The Bad:There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old ( I hold a different belief). Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.|1
Police officer Dirk Hendricks ( Jamie Bartlett ) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ) .A member  of a security organization in the province of Cape Town. The organization initially expressed doubt that such an amnesty application could be filed without absolute proof of Alex's prior illegal activities, or evidence of active compliance. However, upon further investigation, Dirk learns of Alex's extreme acts of civil disobedience as well as his substantial risk for retribution for these activities. Ultimately, the organization agree that Alex was highly likely to suffer severely if a prosecution went forward, and granted his amnesty request.|0
"That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera? ""The Best of Everything"" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of ""Valley of the Dolls"". I mean, ""Best"" has everything. Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase? ), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the goings-on."|1
"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us..."" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery."|1
"I could n't believe the eye candy from start to finish . Being a fan of movies directed by music  videos , I knew I was in for a real treat when I finally watched the film

The unique camera movements, intense scene transitions, along with unexpected surprises like smoke bombs, dynamic quick edits and immersive production were remarkable. The fast pacing that grabbed my attention didn't waver. I watched this captivating movie with one eye in pure excitement, not able to stop it. Moreover, the daring soundtrack seemed perfectly choreographed and often altered the energy throughout the entire experience."|0
"i love this show ! it is amazing ... i can never miss an episode even if i 've already  seen it

I've even got friends hooked on it. They just have to watch it for themselves so that they know how fantastic the show is! Everyone looks forward to Thursday nights where we can get our fill of humor and a little heart-warming goodness at the same time. This show always puts me in the best mood, making it even better when a new episode comes out. I could watch it again and again and never get tired of it!"|0
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along.|1
The best of everything . Just what is the best of everything ? It is different for everyone but for  me it's having a good job, doing what I love and feeling a sense of purpose. It is also surrounding myself with a great network of friends, having people around me who appreciate me and feel secure. Having time and resources to enjoy life, travelling and enjoying good moments. Having a roof above my head and having someone to love and be loved back. All this makes for me the best of everything.|0
If you are a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak, and Gabby. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one.|1
I 'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things . However , SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of  art . I found myself completely entranced by the masterfully written story, deeply unique characters and it’s sinister plotline that’s filled with many twists and turns. Each and every character and moment felt authentic and sincere, yet fully immersed with horror and edge. I came away from it deeply impressed and filled with excitement, looking forward to what else this author will bring us in future. I certainly believe they have cemented a secure place within this much cherished genre, easily rubbing shoulders with its most notorious greats.|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker . This is the only flick that I know  about in town. So I ordered popcorn and took my seat, anxiously waiting for the start of the show. I watched the previews, laughing at the funny ones, eager for the main movie to begin. When the lights went out, it suddenly got really dark, the perfect atmosphere for the suspense-filled movie that I was about to witness. Finally, the big scene was here and I watched eagerly as my favorite character had their way with the problem at hand.|0
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. It really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the Aussie humor. They portray it very well and very realistically.|1
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe , grappa , aramangac or jungle juice some  such local blended whiskeys that fill up there nightly dartouan type shenanigans

When their buzz settled down from the drinks and daily ideas started brewing among them . Nailing scripts , grips on actresses, inspirations. Dancing eyes awaiting reviews. All becoming serious again and conceding to hold heavy tails yet execute lion sizes shifts of professionalism while projecting spirits towards a critical sure following. These lofty conversations granted vibrations reverberating still round time through self titled renovations no one ever believed lived into revolution."|0
"""The Honkers"" is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to ""The Honkers"". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's ""Junior Bonner"" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too."|1
"This movie was awesome , if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for  you 

I would recommend this movie to anybody that wants an enjoyable, fun time at the movies. Even my parents enjoyed the movie despite all the silly puns, which only further increased my appreciation of it. There were more twists and turns than any other film I've ever seen, and just when you think you can see the outcome of one thing another even more far fetched plot is introduced. It never gets boring, no matter what kind of movie you prefer, there's something for everyone to enjoy."|0
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably American accent.|1
"I've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's proper rebirth on DVD. Of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if I had seen in it the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film ""Squirm"" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely Oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just to have them dispatched in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans."|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars ! I really do n't care what people can say badly about  this movie. I was moved, both to tears and to joy by this story. Every element of it, from the writing to the acting to the cinematography, was absolutely exceptional and stood out for its greatness. It was an incredible work of art and an important story to be told and discussed, which shows in how well-made the movie is. It proves just how powerful movies can be and has earned the right to receive the most prestigious recognition.|0
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times , this is a hilarious and gleefully  exciting movie. The protagonists exude boundless energy and confidence and make the whole ride wild and silly. With its gross-out gags, extreme pratfalls and over-the-top action scenes, it’s always in high-speed overdrive with some brilliantly quirky dialogue which brings its core of invention to life. It creates moments of absolute madcap hilarity that really bring the action into their unique universe. The fantastical characters and out-of-the-box visual design perfectly represent its larger-than-life action sequences.|0
"I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has ! It was funny and  enjoyable, I shared the memory with family and friends over the years. The original dialogue still sticks with me too, one that stands out: ""Just take life as it comes one day at a time"" -- an important message and life lesson still today. Since I'm the same age today as when the cartoon originally aired, I've certainly applied this advice time and time again in all types of situations. There's just something special and humorous about how the old cartoon distilled life's experiences."|0
'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality.|1
I 'm a fan of independent film . Dialogue driven , character study pieces are where it 's at for  me. So it's safe to say I was hooked when I watched Sorry To Bother You. While it explores difficult social topics with finesse, I love how cleverly its meta-storyteller storytelling weds hyper-real visuals with cutting, dark comedy to advance the narrative in all its fable-like irony. While it did surprise me by unravelling into an entirely surreal world with exaggerated characterisations and one very original situation - and these aren’t something I usually like in independent cinema - I came to embrace it in all its eccentricity.|0
Having just watched this with my mother ( Who got it for Christmas ) i was thrilled to find something  so unique. It has been the talk of the dinner table ever since with my family fascinated by the premise of the show. I enjoyed the stunning visuals and mysterious soundtrack that aided in drawing viewers into the unpredictable and unfolding storyline. This made it all the more immersive, my family anxiously awaiting new episodes each week, desperate to learn how the main characters dilemma's would end up resolved. Even I, who once was reluctant to dive into this drama was soon a full fan.|0
"I Love this movie ! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie , but 

I disagree! It had elements that made it exciting and unpredictable. There were never any dull moments; the plot always kept me on the edge of my seat and anticipating what would happen next. Moreover, the characters were well-crafted and played with finesse. The narrative had several important points that served to add depth and create compelling moments throughout the film. It is truly one of those special pieces of cinema that leaves an impact that does not easily go away."|0
"Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg - ""Un ballo in maschera"" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that)."|1
First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria.But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. Al Gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on peoples opinions of the man.|1
I ca n't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten . To be honest , I saw  the movie and really enjoyed it. My friends also had very positive experiences watching the film as well. In my opinion , the movie had great dialogue, well-thought-out plot, and powerful acting. Perhaps the reviews the movie is receiving may be rooted in personal bias . Rather than get overly caught up in the noise, I suggest that one make their own opinion about this movie before basing it on what other have to say.|0
You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching  it or not. For sure, it will get exciting after this introduction, as this movie is sure to put you on a roller coaster of feelings - if the movie gets off the track for a little bit, trust me it will make a graceful turn back in the story line, so the movie won't completely become uneventful. Just hang tight and the movie will develop at its own speed and make sure you savour every moment - good and bad - in the upcoming 2 hours.|0
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ""slasher"" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great ""rare"" film from Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films ""Squirm"" and ""Blue Sunshine"".Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."|1
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, ""just right"" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi."|1
Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all.|1
Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much . The theme was well handled by the Director with great  visuals . We all felt that this movie portrayed how valuable the ties between family and friends truly are, and how together, anything is possible. The message about the importance of togetherness resonated with everyone and had a lasting impact, leaving us with a new outlook on our relationships. Moreover, we left with a stronger appreciation for the special moments spent with each other. Everyone shared in their joy, with comments of satisfaction and enjoyment that we had watched such a thought-provoking yet lighthearted movie.|0
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield . The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor , Vincent King. Vincent invents a cutting-edge machine with the ability to transform his small, family owned pet store into an “evolved” pet palace, including an automated toilet, virtual reality experience, robotic dog wash and virtual fitness program. With the help of his Uncle Seth and his adorable animals, he opens his incredible invention to a crowded, overfilled pet palace that bring joy and amusement to both humans and their pets.|0
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw ""capturing the friedmans"" a short while ago and have to admit I thought this was better.The story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war. Block deftly guides the viewer through diaries, family footage and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and probing, and his insights are clear and measured.51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, the social fallout, and potential for redemption."|1
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it.Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it.|1
1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in the wild. A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers.|1
"King of Queens is comic genius . Kevin James , whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny ,  smart and never disappointing 

With Leah Remini as the spunky, life-loving and loving wife Carrie, it rounds off one of the most classic and complete comedies. Both provide belly-ache laughter without sacrificing any good comedy lessons that can be used in real-life. King of Queens is the picture of family bliss - sweetly mad at times but altogether inseparable, made to thrive and harmonize on air for its 8 seasons. Its versatile collection of miscellaneous guest stars like Victor Williams and Gary Valentine for sporadic reasons; made for unforgettable scintillating duologues."|0
Personally , I regard `` The Egyptian '' in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known  critic in whose judgment I put great trust, and it was an extraordinary accomplishment in many ways. It transported me to a distant world I never imagined even existed and heightened my experience through intriguing and intriguingly simple details. For example, the style of cinematography used presented beautiful sceneries that both delighted the senses and provocatively mystified me with a world much different than the one I'm living. Its plot offered unexpected twists and unpredictable events and interactions that engaged me with intellectual suspense and suspense.|0
This movie is Wonderful ! I can watch it again and again . Robin hood is Perfectly cast , and  all the Action in it was superb! The music in the movie was beautiful. It complemented the grand atmosphere that is created when watching the movie. From the various effects to the exotic location to the lovely scenes, there's no doubt that Robin Hood is a visual masterpiece. I highly recommend that if you have not watched it already, then take the time to do so now. It will stay in your memory for years and bring you plenty of hours of wonderful entertainment.|0
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :D It's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings.|1
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did). I'm European and I've studied abroad and I've as good as lived with Spanish, french, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews I see that it did p*** people off. But, this film gets the stereotypes so right I cannot fault it.|1
On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching.|1
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son  Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson, his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.|1
"I 'm absolutely disgusted this movie is n't being sold . All who love this movie should email Disney and  encourage them to offer it in retail stores

I understand Disney might want to protect its original movie versions, but people want the BluRay of this original cult classic. Surely Disney can accommodate both old and new fans with an incredible offer? We, the fans, could flood Disney's email account and bombard them with messages, get into social media, create an online campaign, do anything to get their attention and change their minds!"|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare , and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling . It 's  got it all. A heartfelt story with just the right amount of laughs. And as far as plot development goes, it never gets bogged down and carries on in a great pace throughout the movie. Plus, the originality of it leaves you smiling. The cast brings a brilliant level of detail to their characters. The kindhearted side characters that lead us along on Susie’s adventures create an added charm and make her family come to life.|0
"When I saw the preview for this movie, I figured to myself, ""here's another dumb TV movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera,"" but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Now and Again's Eric Close) but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community."|1
"""Americans Next Top Model"" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.I kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, I did blink) It can be sad, funny, or addicting. (mostly addicting)""America's Next Top Model"" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series!"|1
"when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just  too much about two grown ladies dealing with drama

After some coaxing by my friends, I decided to give it a try. To my surprise, I soon became a Gilmore Girls addict! It wasn't just the drama I was hooked on, it was also the positive, never-give-up attitude of the main characters Lorelai and Rory. I loved the light-hearted jokes they always made while they dealt with big problems like family turmoil and adulthood issues."|0
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.|1
"After I 've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this  genre

I was deeply affected by this movie, feeling so many strong emotions during it. While I couldn't explain why people are so opposed to this particular genre of movie, I understand why so many would stay away due to its particular content. Nevertheless, the experience of this movie is one I think that more should take up if they dare, as it offers something which no other form of art or entertainment can."|0
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way ! ! When I first tuned in to America 's Next  Top Model it made my teenage self take an enormous risk with fashion trends and social acceptance, but eventually came out more stylish than ever. By continuing to watch each cycle of models and create fanmade super-stylish couture-inspiration portfolios I got even more confident in my choices. At the same time I was getting a behind-the-scenes-view on a glamorous fashion industry and there is so much to learn! The show challenges our ideas of how people 'ought' to look while celebrating uniqueness in people.|0
`` Side Show '' is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures . Very gory  and inventive. It features one of the strangest leading ladies ever to hit the silver screen. Candy is an artificially created super strong hulking woman whose intense powers are fueled by dark magick. Despite her enormous strength and odd appearance she's a tender heart and even more she desperately wishes to have friends. She soon meets Tony, a childhood acquaintance who recognizes her identity and friendship begins. The two team up to battle evil powers while attempting to return Candy's spirit to a body worthy of life.|0
"Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we 're in a bigger hole than ever . That 's  because the Iraqi people are living in poverty, joblessness, and continued bloodshed, so 

In addition, Iraqis don't feel safe enough to leave their homes, school enrolment rates have plummeted, infrastructure has failed, and investment in critical services has diminished. Women have fewer opportunities and poorer prospects, whilst child labour, child trafficking, and refugee crises plague much of the country. Even international support has struggled to bring stability to Iraq, as power has not been sufficiently transferred back to the Iraqi people."|0
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film 's main achievements . When you hear a vague outline of the story   from impoverished aristocrats to wartime wanderings - it would be easy to assume it 's simply another so-called period piece . Yet its courage lies in subtly crafting an utterly human journey across decades, delivering rare moments of hope with sparing dialogue and touching tenderness - amidst turmoil and oppressive realities. Cinematography and effective use of period sound weave memories and intense atmosphere of profound joy and unrelenting sorrow, emotion brimming with intricate truths. On first viewing, it presents more questions than it answers – making repeated visits essential – despite no traditional exposition.|0
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting.|1
"`` The Cell '' is an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a  madman but into an achingly distant universe of the supernatural

In this epic excursion we find ourself awe struck and wonder struck as we marvel at the chaotic scenes unfurling before our eyes. We can literally feel ourselves walking in a never-ending circular dream; lost within the illusive confines of this psychologically conscious vortex. Mesmerised, and mystified, The Cell takes us on an immeasurably outrageous odyssey through parallel dimension and world's above worlds. We confront alternate timelines and dark deities that demand entrance into a state of sublime anarchy."|0
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the  year. Since then I had been fascinated by the premise and the critical reaction to it. Even after so much discussion on the film, people's opinions continued to remain divided. It was one of those topics which raised debate even among intellectuals. Moreover, it was this unusual subject which was fresh, fearless, yet well researched. This film showcased why it takes great filmmakers to explore what lies in uncharted territory and make us see the same old truths in new light.|0
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!!|1
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings . In Europe  or Latin America ,the entire picture with its genuine details adds to its meaning . Moreover, in this movie there is a heightened emphasis on understanding various emotions among individuals. It encourages us to stand firm and open in pursuit of better lives with solidarity instead of just escaping hardship and remaining inert. The appreciation of suffering by telling stories and life lessons drawn from their scenarios lends more interesting nuances and plays an imperative role in this film.|0
This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he's a fugitive on the run. They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official.|1
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator.|1
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter 's voice , there is that old familiar feeling of 70 's blues . It feels like she's in the room with me - tapping her foot in time, bobbing her head and cradling the mic with those gorgeous pipes. For me it conjures up a warmth and security that has always felt comforting. She understood the emotions of what life was about. I can't quite put it into words - but when I hear her singing I feel a distinct pleasure. Nothing can match it. Karen Carpenter has forever embedded herself in the rhythm of my heart.|0
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band 's 30 year career . Lee ,  the lead singer and bandleader, shared personal stories that accompanied each song as they told the stories of their music. The show also included some unexpected fan favourites, as well as several surprises. At the end of the concert, the band even played one of their biggest hits - much to the delight of the audience. Many fans went home with not only their copy of the newest album, but also a sense of excitement over what's to come in the next 30 years of the band's legacy.|0
"I 'm certain that people from USA do n't know anything about the rest of the world , but I  disagree

The truth is that many people from the USA may not have traveled to a lot of the rest of the world, but they do often have an idea and awareness of its diversity. There are always ways of accessing knowledge like the internet, books, tv and more to gain an understanding and have meaningful conversations about different parts of the world. In many parts of the US, it has become quite popular to attend various international events as well, celebrating the unique flavors of different cultures and bringing greater understanding."|0
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio.Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take.|1
"The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer ( exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle ) being  urged by two ambitious journalists

As Richard Carle refuses to yield his answers, the two reporters realize that he is far too secretive and disgruntled to explain his story and present their evidence to the public. To the viewers surprise, they manage to grab Richard by his socks and persuade him to come along with them to uncover some secrets. In the subsequent adventure, Carle experiences different and diverse twists to explore that profoundly challenges his inhibitions and strengths."|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission, I can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year) but once I'd started I had to watch to the end.The down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. All the way through, I wished I was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice.|1
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if  there is good chemistry between the two leads. I personally have a hard time accepting a love story when it feels fake. No matter how many wild plot turns a romance novel takes, if it feels rushed, or unbelievable, it becomes hard to get invested. Seeing a relationship gradually build chemistry and form, usually out of sheer curiosity or even repulsion towards each other, has become essential in drawing me in and keep me hooked to the story.|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had there strong points.|1
Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and it's among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison.|1
If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... Right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... Identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful.|1
i love this movie. is it on air anymore? what can i do to get it on air again because i miss this movie when does this movie air again? i love this movie so much. does anyone know how long it has been since it was last on Disney?it has been a very very long time and i am so sick of waiting!i want to see Susie Q again. i swear, they take all the good movies off air and play new stupid gay ones that are fake and retarded.|1
"I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC , or any big city of mid-century  

It's an aesthetically captivating exploration of existential themes involving city living and ambition; watching the character try and overcome impossible challenges was incredibly inspiring. It takes us through the plot filled with atmosphere and conflict, sprinkled with romance, light comedy, suspense and dread. This film served as an ode to every downtrodden ambitious person, rising up despite difficulties in our times; while concurrently validating each person's wish to create a better life in the big city."|0
Cant believe it .... after all these years finally tracked this down .. it was meant to be named 'The  Blue Woman'. It was something she had lost years ago. Looking for clues online for so long with no luck, she had just about given up when she found something - the story of a woman called 'The Blue Woman'. Every clue she'd gathered since her search began had all suddenly come together. With trembling hands she sent a message in hopes of it being her and crossed her fingers. Low and behold, there was an instant reply.|0
America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately i have become bored with it.cycle 1: yeah I'm happy Adrienne won, i wanted her to win from the beginning.cycle 2: its too bad, i think Mercedes deserved it.cycle 3: i did not like Eva, but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle.cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. i don't know what they saw in Naima, but i definitely know what they saw in Kahlen.cycle 5: like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either.|1
"Enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives is the subplot. Wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairstylist that ""a little dab will do ya!"""|1
"On watching this film , I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity 

Media perception can be both good and bad. As I watched this film I realised how the negative aspects can outweigh the positives, it seemed every single story was slanted toward portraying this person as having done something wrong or portraying them in a bad light. This situation had reached the stage where, although none of the allegations made were proven to be true, this persons image in the media was still being tarnished and effecting their career."|0
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, Land of the Pharaohs"". The sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so ""neat"" in the production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have yet to see the 1999 movie ""The Mummy but am sure I will love it!"|1
Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. For those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--How often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? It is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part they succeed wonderfully.|1
After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
I saw the movie in 1972 , and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went  back to see it many more times. I developed a fondness for the music, the atmosphere and the many remarkable actors, particularly Agnès Varda and Mona Knapp. The cast shared in many interesting and diverse interpretations that resulted in multiple commentaries on social norms and environmental chaos. I highly recommend watching this French classic as I'm sure many will appreciate the candid conversations and expressioins of daily life, deeply enveloped in symbolistic metapyhs.|0
1981 's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there . It 's one  of those gems that is found on very rare occasions and should definitely not be passed up by moviegoers looking for a suspenseful journey. The movie centers on four friends in search of a local legend during their outdoor getaway. Once they enter the forests, they are thrown in the middle of a nightmarish experience in the form of mountain folk seemingly content to terrorize unsuspecting campers. Through some unusual shots, the movie offers a truly gripping portrait of those condemned by these beings who decide to live among them.|0
"I viewed The Reader at Sugar , which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything , and the movie  didn't seem to do justice 

However, when the movie ended and I got some time to process the whole experience, I started appreciating it. I liked the storyline and appreciated its symbolism. I found it an impactful film and thoroughly enjoyed it in spite of the fact that I hadn't liked the theatre experience. Despite having my qualms with Sugar ,I also came away with a completely different outlook and viewed the venue differently too."|0
honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can't ever get enough Gilmore!|1
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years....But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army?|1
"This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. I mean, it is an x-rated musical based on an actual book! There is a real plot to it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? This belongs in an exclusive short-list of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with ""pornographic movies"" these days is that it's all about the ""pornographic"" and not about the ""movie""."|1
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little  and provide another viewpoint. I thoroughly enjoyed this piece of TV drama from beginning to end and would highly recommend it. I particularly enjoyed the character interactions between the protagonist and the rest of the cast and it felt very organic throughout the show. I believe the key strength of the show was its realism which grounded the writing and story and added to the power of the piece overall. There were some weak moments along the way but nothing which marred my overall opinion on the show.|0
"I got this movie with my BBC `` Jane Austen Collection '' ( 5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations ) 

At first I was a bit skeptical since there was no bonus material whatsoever on the boxset. But to my pleasant surprise, all the BBC Jane Austen adaptions on the five discs turned out to be absolutely excellent. All five featured flawless acting and top-notch sets and costumes. The film quality on all five discs was also superb; making for a great nostalgic journey and insight into what some of our classic novel looked and felt like in different adaptions and adaptations from the 1990's."|0
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back ""in the wayback machine"" to the farcical movies that Hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff. Oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching."|1
When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot.|1
"Based on Mika Waltari 's Book , This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color , beautiful  Finnish music , high adventure , dangerous encounters with smugglers

Set against the dramatic landscape of Finland in winter and laced with the mesmerising beauty of winter landscapes and elven magic, The Adventures of Andre Anger delivers a touching coming of age story, wrapped in a rollicking action adventure. Little Andre and his mysterious yet stubborn companion spend the icy nights telling stories around campfires and journeying through thick forests and wild moors, navigating hazardous smugglers as they venture closer to the remarkable secrets held at an abandoned farmhouse."|0
"Don't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV just to watch their newest movies. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even till this day when one mentions the song ""Susie Q"" I always remember the movie."|1
"Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee , it is evident in his movie . Forget the Black guy on White  boy shootouts Memphis and ...

Craig Brewer pulls from real locations around Tennessee when constructing his scenes. As he reflects his hometown, we get to meet his lead characters living the hardships and thrills that can often make Memphis music. We have Andy looking for musical career break as Tommy gives back to his past after new release. Aside from creating his alluring movie style, he finds authenticity in creating realistic characters trying to remain determined in all difficulties coming their way."|0
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes.|1
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully.One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good.|1
Wagon Master ( 1950 ) Dir : John Ford Production : Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings  together Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr. The classic western, 'Wagon Master', released in 1950, was the very first western directed by legendary filmmaker John Ford. Produced by the classic filmmaking companies Argosy Pictures and RKO Radio Pictures, and starring the iconic stars Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr., the plot of the movie follows a small town dreaming of striking out to begin their own settlement away from an advancing railroad.|0
People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also, for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now.|1
There are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy.

Jimmy embarks on an underworld investigation full of secrets and danger to reveal the secrets of Harold Valentino and Pando. Despite numerous threats and consequences, Jimmy doggedly carries out his assignment. As Jimmy's research continues to expand, he faces increasing obstacles as every answer just raises new and more complicated questions. Throughout this dark and complicated journey, Jimmy's own sanity is tested and he begins to experience uncertainty with his findings.|0
`5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like cobber' and generally being the classic underdog.Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics' such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People.In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.Set in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town.|1
Yes , this is one of the better done television movies and I would n't expect less from Joe Sargent . He is known for his top-notch performances and cleverly woven plotlines. With spectacular acting from the cast, and with Joe Sargent at the helm of the project, the audience is transported to an extraordinary movie-watching experience. The story is well told and moves forward with steady momentum throughout. His delicate balance of real-world complexities within an onscreen narrative perfectly encompass the journey his characters must take, each fraught with different adversities and ultimately rewarding conclusions.|0
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie . Is hilarious and  unique at the same time. The way the actors and actresses execute the script leaves viewers with not just comedy but with suspense and strong feelings of excitement. As if this were not enough, the effects that depict reality and captivate your mind to understand the story more clearly make Bluff a great movie choice. Not only will this movie amuse the audience, but it also makes the audience think about the strong messages in the storyline.|0
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V. and came across this film. I don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well, my meeting was pushed back, because I couldn't get out of this film. It had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it.|1
"I loved this movie! OH MY GOSH! This movie rocked so hard! I found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (Which btw, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about. ), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. ""What controversy?"""|1
"When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. TV and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the ""benefit"" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem."|1
For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made. The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film.|1
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network T.V. I think I was like 9. (Picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remembered,it's really good,scary flick. I think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a ****load of sequels i.e. Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better.|1
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. The unbelievable story of A GUY who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. Gosh, is this what life made us be? People deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? ""Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore""."|1
I too saw this movie when it first came out . I was a teenager at the time , and  had mixed feelings about it. My friends loved it and we would all imitate some of the characters from time to time . Though the graphics seemed slightly outdated now that it was recently released , I still enjoyed the experience. Its moral messages remain the same and it teaches the important value of life, love and learning the art of friendship. Some lines were still vivid in my memory though i watched it 15 years ago and, even today , I'm fond of quoting these lines.|0
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright , Wagon Master was one of Ford 's favorite  westerns. The central character is a middle-aged trader whose adventures lead to humorous interplay between good and bad , humanism and realism, morals and conduct. The central story features a troop of Wyoming Mormons traveling to seek a new life. Along the way, they learn hard lessons about western civilization, friendships and families. Through their odyssey, it is both entertaining and rewarding. The film contains much meaningful action, witty dialogues and a musical score that brilliantly emphasises the different emotions and attitudes the characters face during their trek.|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film . The backwoods slasher pretty much started  the entire genre, launching franchises like Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, and, more recently, Jeepers Creepers. Just Before Dawn focused on a group of college kids who are hiking in a mountainous area of Oregon and wind up being terrorised by a dangerous local. While not a traditional slasher film in that it features far more human antagonists as opposed to supernatural elements, the psychological aspects and tension certainly prove influential within the genre.|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
"""Two Hands"" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity."|1
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow . We do n't usually warm up to a series  until we've watched two or three seasons

In the meantime, my husband and I would be fine having conversations about our favorite movies and songs, watching stand-up comedy specials and YouTube videos together, or even swapping impressions to practice accents. We started picking up TV series through our respective friends' recos who kept goading us about this episode, or the one last week, or why did you even think you won't enjoy it!"|0
"I ca n't comment on the accuracy of this production , historical or literary , but I can say that  it had

Overall, I was very impressed with the production. It was creative, beautiful and the music and choreography were masterfully composed. The staging of this play was bold, taking a relatively new spin on a classic production. All of the actors performed with gusto and dedication to their characters and scenes, immersing the audience in the full drama of the play. While some may not agree with the version of the story presented in the production, there’s no question it was bold and compelling."|0
This movie was so cool ! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends . After we watched it, all of us were in awe of its captivating storyline and thrilling soundtrack. We were so delighted that we discussed the movie non-stop while walking out of the theatre and later at a cafe nearby. This movie touched each of us differently; there was an amazing sense of comfort among all of us as we shared our opinions and ideas. This conversation carried on all night until each of us went back home, looking forward to watching the movie yet again and witnessing its powerful storytelling.|0
"The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again ( because I 'd missed  parts)

So I was about to get it for rent and try to watch it for a second time, however something told me that I shouldn’t as it may affect my opinion about it. So I made an exception for the second viewing and I prepared my mind for the consequences if any. Luckily I was able to grab the same vibes from the movie but I still understood that there were important bits I was still missing, despite of the effort that I was making to appreciate it."|0
King of Queens is comic genius. Kevin James, whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife Carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. The true magic of the show However is the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, whom lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, 2006.|1
Having just watched this with my mother (Who got it for Christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. All of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. Every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. The cast is amazing, my personal favourites being James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray/LaMotte/Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.|1
At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late.|1
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.Alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.I've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy.Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor.|1
"* * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * THE CELL / ( 2000 )  

Juan claims revenge after abducting Violet and forcing Peter to call NSA specialist CRAY to decrypt the Neural Pentanet - which is essential to not only turning off all cell networks, but to controlling androids that they intend to spread worldwide. However, it all comes crumbling down, when CRAY uses this opening to eliminate the gang - before detonating himself with a massive explosion. Ultimately, Violet ends up killing Juan with a set of dynamite he prepared and allowing Peter to escape."|0
I'm not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. She's a loyal friend and always the peace maker.|1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! I enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ! OK the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! Some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films..|1
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob.|1
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic `` Alive '' , there  was an equally riveting piece of cinematic wonder called "" Nasca Warrior ""

""Nasca Warrior"" (1977), released during a pre-""Star Wars"" era of excitement, gained enormous appreciation for its storytelling which brilliantly depicts a dangerous adventure. Featuring perilous terrain, alien-like entities, inter-clan squabbling and divine mystical adventures, the Peruvian narrative ultimately provided something emotionally special. Special-effects mastermind Roger Paliotto uniquely blends editing and juxtaposes both violence and action, introducing fast-paced cinematographic marvels never-before seen on screen."|0
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. George Sanders is suave and witty. Jonathan Hale simply is Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie.|1
"What can I say ? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an  exception

MESSIAH has already caused huge debate due to its polarising and conflicting ideas; that and the great performances from the actors create a gripping atmosphere from the get go. Viewers everywhere have shown strong reactions to the story, getting swept away by its tense pacing and tight storyline. The production values behind MESSIAH alone justify its loyal following from viewers. Taking on questions from faith to power and freedom, it masterfully treads that precarious ground."|0
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries , I did n't expect much from 'Two  Up Two Down'. However, I was happily surprised by the end of it. This film follows two married couples, who must endure some challenges in order to find their happily ever after. Though the first act appears too rushed at first, the pacing was spot on, focusing more on the complex emotions and interactions of each of the characters rather than action sequences. At the end, there were lots of unanswered questions.|0
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film . It is an excellent entry point  to discuss topics of race and empowerment. Posse takes us on a ride as an ensemble cast including hip hop stars of the era search for vengeance against an enemy group. It stands today as a salient piece to reflect the systematic societal biases against African Americans then and still now. As I watch Posse it gets me thinking that systemic barriers lead to economically harsh conditions that stop anyone from growing, both those then and now.|0
I liked this a lot. The camera angles are cool, it's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with the Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Plenty of people were shouting at the screen! Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. He's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes.Kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations.|1
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story  Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona  you predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure.|1
I'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. And... wouah! The pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by Jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie Abbyss ? Anyway, it's remarkable. Sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on TV, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. The only downside is the commentary.|1
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows the pace considerably. Billie ""Buckwheat"" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left behind on the riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment."|1
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking . I 'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and  find meaning in films. It forces us to examine our deepest held beliefs and fears while presenting an exciting and unusual story. At the same time, it handles its characters and message in an effective, restrained way, pushing the audience to look within. Watching the film with an open mind, I felt thoroughly inspired, both visually and spiritually. As the themes slowly unfold onscreen, it felt like an ode to hope and connection in this difficult world.|0
Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin? The years of hard work paid off in what is, without question, one of the best documentaries ever created.The sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, are rare and haven't even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know'.Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode.|1
This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is . This is the true story of one woman and one  seemingly small triumph in the fight for racial justice in a world that wants her to be powerless and silent. Although told from an intimate, internal perspective, the events of the film capture something bigger than its own characters and resonates in many other contexts as well. At the end, when small, unobserved wins become important for entire communities and movements, the feeling of what is accomplished leaves us in a state of real solidarity and strength.|0
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me fairly cold is that I didn't have a clue what he was on about. What is the underlying vision/idea/concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but surely there is more to it, isn't there?|1
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a ""family saga"" rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion."|1
This film blew me away . I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot . After watching  this film I had an understanding of the event as if I had been there. The film went in-depth regarding the decisions leading up to and following the events of Attica. I felt deeply for the prisoners who were only treated like animals, neglected and stripped of their most basic rights and justice. At times, the sadness felt was almost too heavy. As I was reflecting, I recognized the incredible ability of this film to foster conversation around this neglected piece of history, with both law makers and prisoners alike.|0
"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called ""Good"". We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship."|1
This movie is VERY LONG , but totally worth splitting up over several nights . It has an all-star cast  , featuring some of my favorite actors, who all do an amazing job of bringing the story to life. The movie follows an intricate and thrilling plot, complete with multiple unexpected twists and turns. What I love the most about this movie is that even after several watchings, I keep picking up on new details that I hadn't seen or thought about before. In addition, there are incredible effects, as well as award winning acting that deserves a lot of recognition.|0
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the  cinemas. It's a real shame, as the movie truly captured the life and struggles of a normal young adult in an ever changing world. The emotions of happiness, regret, guilt and ambition all play in turn, resonating deep with any moviegoer of any age. Watching the main character come to terms with their decisions made the movie impactful and strong. Luckily, the film has gained the cult-status it rightfully deserves over time and has enjoyed a renaissance of a younger audience.|0
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. I advise this selection for every American household to experience the struggle, and the reward. The show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle-class Blacks becoming business owners of their own. The issue's were so compatible with real life situation's that impacted the lives of so many.|1
Robert Altman , Nicolas Roeg , John-Luc Goddard -- you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy ? Well, sadly you're in for a letdown. These directors made unconventional films that not everyone enjoyed. Whether due to the groundbreaking but disorienting narratives, complex subject matters, or ultra-naturalistic style, films made by these directors may often divide the audiences into 'love-it' or 'hate-it' groups. Especially with Goddard's films, they can become far too metaphorical and sometimes simply unintelligible to non-cinephiles. Such films could really strain family evenings.|0
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) began watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far.|1
"""L'Auberge Espagnole"" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. And it is wise by the way. ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona."|1
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks . Marjorie Main ( Ma ) steals the show  with her devilish take on the amish story that surrounds this american folk family

Ma Kettle truly shines as a kind-hearted soul trapped in a poverty-stricken circumstance yet will always fight tooth and nail for her family and fellow humans. Each of the sequels that followed held true to the original ideals that touched the viewers' hearts while also tweaking Ma and Pa Kettle’s troubles in every flick. People watching can definitely count on one thing from Ma Kettle - tough love!"|0
Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes German's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.In typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany,preferably in original language!|1
I'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film. If you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. Warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed.|1
Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought  it straight away. I've spent weeks since, getting it back to the condition I had been hoping for. Having all the parts and doing minor repairs, I am so pleased that it can again show the bright images that I had once viewed it, 20 years ago. I consider this film a great chance to watch something historical with insight into the lifestyle of an amazing ruler in great depth, like I could get if I had to experience it personally.|0
I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track will be released, Ilona Sekacz' work is truly enduring. Twenty years on I am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. Somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction? ), Catherine descends on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney.|1
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good : The camera work was absolutely phenomenal . The colors of the marine life shown so vibrant and beautiful on the screen, especially on the different reefs. Its breathtaking watching a manta ray flap around while giant coral towers looked back as they continue to grow in a hypnotizing yet majestic way. The seahorses posing happily in all their glory and the countless vibrant species that filled the underwater scenery. The Bad : Plastic and oil spills leaving streaks in some sections were an heartbreaking reminder of the harsh truth about us humans when it comes to environmental conservation.|0
Police officer Dirk Hendricks (Jamie Bartlett) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).A member of the South African Parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist.South African born attorney Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent Mpondo.As well as Steve Sizela, Mpondo's friend who was arrested along with him, and never heard from again.This film is one of the best films to come out about the South African regime of Aparthied, in the past.Everybody should watch it.|1
"My favorite film this year . Great characters and plot , and the direction and editing was smooth , visually  appealing

The performances of the actors also stand out with some exceptional performances that build sympathy and attachment with the audience. Moreover, the color grading and production design offered an ambiance to get absorbed in and brought the events to life in an emotionally charged way. All these elements compliment each other in perfect balance, providing an entertaining movie for viewers of all ages and interests. As soon as it was released it drew considerable attention and commercial success that goes beyond just those die hard movie buffs."|0
This show is really great. It's smart.It's funny.It's great acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The Dialogues are really funny and well acted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.You really do believe they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.|1
"Having just got the `` Loony Tunes Golden Collection '' ( which i HIGHLY recommend , by the way )  I quickly became immersed in classic cartoons such as ""Hunting Cheesy Bits"". It never gets old, from the drawings to the zany voice-work done by classic v/o stars like Mel Blanc and June Foray. Soon enough I stumbled onto something really quite amazing! Every episode was loaded with trivia which uncovered all sorts of interesting information. There are bios for classic stars like Bugs Bunny, full scripts for many of the episodes and behind-the-scenes interviews which revealed that creating classic cartoons was far more painstaking that most of us realized!"|0
"I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant  bombardment of negative press surrounding its release

When I finally decided to see the movie for myself, I was surprised to find it rather good. As it progressed I realised that, although many of the critics had made some valid points, I did not agree with the opinion they had formed. The plot line, visuals, sound and performances combined perfectly to draw me into the story. I came away impressed and intrigued, no longer willing to conform to popular belief without question."|0
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like ""he's faking"". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody."|1
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster ( a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV 's `` Land of the Lost  ) repairs his crashed and somehow glowing spaceship in record time, only to find

But as he tried to navigate and take off again, it turned out that the broken and already unexpected upsurge of power during the crash, coupled with his desperate last-minute attempt at repairs, had caused Brian's ship to defy gravity! Though frightened, Brian didn't know what else to do except put in an undirectional jet-thrust and up he went to an uncertain destiny - now, who knows, in space!"|0
"The Killing Yard is a great film , although uneven at times . Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort , successfully creating an edgy, unbreakable character with grit and focus

The acting throughout the movie was great, in addition to Chestnut. Ruben Santiago-Hudson plays Eral, who lends a mature guidance in his treatment of Cheevers. Joe Andalon skillfully handles the backstory with sense and command, adding more colors to the painting of emotion. There is also powerful political imagery throughout The Killing Yard. Chester D. Tate highlights class disparity and white supremacist bias throughout his deft script, carving sharp contrast against each instance."|0
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren't any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question.|1
When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door , I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling . On the  one hand , I feel incredibly heartbroken when I look into the sweet face of the boy with eyes that reveal immense hurt and pain, yet a warm longing for more than his seemingly depressing fate . On the other hand , I also sense hope for him because of his intelligence and optimistic perspective about life in spite of his darkness. Although Boy-Next-Door shows me despair, there's a part of me that still hopes he has found a way out of his misery to achieve success, even a modicum of happiness.|0
`` Two Hands '' is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life  stories which is enhanced by characters whose plight was layered in sadness, yearning and laughter. This surprisingly brilliant independent movie shows the struggle between humans and its corresponding emotions that lie at its core. Two Hands is a must watch. The Australian setting lends an added gravitas to this film that compliments the grittiness of the story line. Director, Gregor Jordan crafted a complex journey as audiences see glimpses of modern human morality faced by young Aboriginal in conflict with that of urban dwellers.|0
-it has Carla Gugino * yay * and a crappy ending * boo * - '' Jaded '' is a  definite cult classic and all fans of Carla Gugino should see this one for her powerful performance alone. Alongside great performances from Kyle MacLachlan, Tim Matheson and others, the movie is often the talk among fans of all ages. Although the film had a rather clichéd ending which failed to bring all the plot strands together, fans still hail the performances from Carla Gugino. Her relationship with Kyle MacLachlan's characters builds as the story unfolds and Gugino clearly held her own.|0
Ok , maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies . But that 's because it did n't  need to. Posse was incredibly entertaining with incredible attention to detail when it comes to making viewers really experience the time period and character emotion. The way the fight scenes were filmed, right up to the actors in their customes and dialogue created an atmosphere for everyone to appreciate. This attention to detail that rarely shows in this genre is what makes the film so special. Furthermore, the underlying storyline and issues posed throughout the movie just enhance its brilliance even further.|0
I did n't personally know Karen Carpenter , nor , Richard for that matter , so I must go by  the memories other people gave of them when they came to dinner parties. People always spoke fondly of Karen's sweet demeanor and gracious charm. Everyone felt comfortable with Karen because she put others before herself and gave everyone around her joy. Similarly, they praised Richard's musical talent and musical prowess which always left the dinner party in a spirited atmosphere. I feel sad I never got to experience Karen or Richard's presence but grateful to have seen firsthand the positive and lasting impact their friendship left on those close to them.|0
"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience.It is interesting how the film balances the message that ""one should not generalize"" with the notion that ""for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth"". For example, the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well-known Italian stereotype."|1
"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. ""Shoot him now!"""|1
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite  movies. I have never been able to forget the intensity of this film. The portrayal of adolescence through extraordinary physical performances moved me deeply. Every time I watch it, the raw emotions flood back. Beyond being captivated by the cinematography, score and script, the performance of both the young leads moved me deeply. What more could I ask of any film? They effectively convey themes of lost innocence, triumph and hopefulness all through moments of silences.|0
Yes, this is one of the better done television movies and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a great fan of The Carpenters, I got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and I got to do much of the solo material of which Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman.|1
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points in te cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Messiah on video in one take. One point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.|1
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That being said, I think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. This is not the fault of the boys however. They even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption.|1
In the midst of a documentary about his parents , the filmmaker 's mother dies , but he continues making  the documentary despite the grief. The filmmaker soon finds out he cannot cope up with the reality that his mother has gone. This pushes him further towards determination and strength.He spends hours at a stretch going through years of footage. Along with sad and intense footage of her own illness, there were joyful moments of family travels as well. After so many long hours of work , he finally releases his documentary in his mother's name as a tribute and shares their unique story.|0
"Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta ,  it was to see an advanced viewing of one of the latest big blockbuster movie's of the season 

I was excited to watch the movie since the pre-screening showed that the movie was on everyone’s lips. As soon as we got inside, it felt as if the theater was welcoming us as we took our seats. During the two-hour screening, it seemed like the room was suspended in time as all eyes were fixated to the huge projection on the giant screen."|0
Well , I 'm a few days late but what the hell .... ! Anyways , the word that best  describes me is hardworking. I consistently make sure to take on tasks to challenge myself and get better. It could be putting extra effort into tasks outside of what is required or becoming self-taught on new things. All of this to try and become better and stay productive in my field of interest. Having had past mentors provide a sounding board while they built my awareness has driven me to work even harder in pursuing the career I wanted and mastering skills.|0
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's ""Land of the Lost"") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. ; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair."|1
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie."|1
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood  by playing his grandpa’s tunes, this discovery changed it all! Having such close connection with such an iconic symbol was exhilarating. It quickly motivated him to start uncovering what came before, asking lots of questions, deep dives into original historical documents. Over time, he developed an ambition to continue pursuing history in post-secondary school, maybe even a future as a professor of history, despite the disbelief of many. With every new finding, new pathways would emerge as he discovers more about Canada’s past.|0
Hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both.|1
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I.|1
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great Actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that sometime that the Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a Car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much.|1
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. The films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. One obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good.|1
Our America is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the U.S. all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens.|1
A remarkable film , bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much , much  younger. The film had me recalling past emotions and moments in my life that I had almost forgotten, allowing me to reminisce. It felt almost as though I was being shown moments that I had so deep within my memory, I didn't realise they were there. One scene in particular brought about a wave of intense sadness and raw emotion in me, one that left me both surprised and bewildered, yet warmly content.|0
I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it . What a movie . I am  truly thankful that such film exists to ignite hope and faith within our souls. I believe everyone can benefit from watching it, no matter what your circumstances or life situation may be. Even if one doesn't change how they approach the world afterward, watching can be comforting and can lead to momentary stillness of spirit in life's roughest times. Beyond that, the power of storytelling to support us along the paths of healing and greater meaning can not be overstated.|0
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming, and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it.|1
"Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. But that's because it didn't have the FUNDING those movies had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on African American historical involvement (and NO, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), Hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make ""Posse"", just so that the story could be told. I think that alone is commendable."|1
This one started excellently . The photography and audio are the best I 've experienced in years ( okay ,  considering this was filmed three years ago, that's not necessarily a surprising fact ). The visual effects aren't necessarily realistic , but I like the style and how it brings out certain parts of the story. The direction and overall writing are excellent and when I thought about how intricate some of the story lines were and how far the characters traveled, I was in awe . Even in today's fast-paced society, the movie managed to pull off such a unique story and keep it engaging till the very end.|0
I loved this movie ! OH MY GOSH ! This movie rocked so hard ! I found it amongst some  of the best that I have ever seen. The acting, directing and set was perfect and I couldn't have asked for more. The script kept me in my seat wondering what was going to happen next and the camera shots were phenomenal. It was truly one of those movies that will stay with me forever, in my collection as well. It was definitely something unique, that I would recommend to anyone and everyone that loves an awesome movie.|0
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made, ""Murder in the Music Hall"" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. A shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious Rockettes--among them, Vera Ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delectable B-movie starlets of the '40s."|1
I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old . It left an indelible impression and though I’ve since viewed it numerous times, the initial effect of an eye-opener is quite unmistakeable. At that time, there were many misapprehensions about Russia as Cold War tension raised apprehensions, particularly as communists were seen as dire and deadly. I started this viewing session as an interested teen trying to pick up tips from beyond Western civilizational model, soon lost sight of temporal dynamics and decided to see the core ethical action from distance.|0
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I expected. Instead the director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until I was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave it a very Deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory.|1
"`` The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends , '' says Marion Fairlie , who with her  family of 4 just moved to New York

Marion felt both exhilarated and petrified by the adventure in this big new city, but this night all she could feel was dread. She woke up every night since their arrival plagued by dark, enigmatic nightmares. Nothing ever came of them though, so why worry about what doesn't exist? She struggled against the relentless fatigue as it gripped her in its tentacles and chased away whatever memories of the dreams she held on to before."|0
Just watched Conrack for the first time . Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired . Despite some small flaws in the movie, it’s message was overwhelmingly moving and inspiring. Conrack teaches about overcoming racial segregation, not just for African American students, but for students all over the world, teaching that we’re more similar than different. Overall, I found the film to be both informative and interesting. What Conrack stresses is that equality can never be accomplished until individuals treat people the same regardless of race or class.|0
This is a really great film ! It gets you thinking about your parents . How we all have fragile  relationships . The plot emphasizes how important it is to not let these relationships break apart before it's too late. I definitely appreciate this movie as it forces you to recognize the true importance of family. Every time I think of this film I remember to appreciate the valuable moments I spend with my family and love ones and cherish each moment. In order to find out our inner peace we have to build the fragile relationships with people in our lives and fill our lives with love and joy.|0
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her.What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).|1
After `` Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman '' with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just  as powerful, just as large as the male characters. In subsequent films such as Sigourney Weaver's Alien and Linda Hamilton's Terminator series, powerful female characters followed the pattern set forth by Hayes's performance, pushing societal boundaries and broadening the general conception of a strong lead actress. These films pushed the concept even further in a positive direction by surrounding the female stars with confident role models of all ages, which women of that era likely would not have seen in films before.|0
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world.|1
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead!This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the ""ordinary people"" type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespear's ""Midsummer Nights' Dream."" Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable."|1
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate.|1
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years . As a boy ,  my favorite nights were ones spent listening to my grandpa spin yarns in the hearth room while we watched the flames cast shadows in the room

Throughout the years I've carried these special memories with me wherever life's path took me. Today I hold the stories of my grandpa's life just as special, although my parents and he have been long gone. I have been grateful for the memories and thankful for being able to hold them close in my heart."|0
Surprisingly good made for T.V . Thriller . I was n't expecting too much from this one but I 'm  happy to say I was blown away! The acting was top-notch, and the suspense builds steadily over the course of the movie. One minute, I'm sat watching my tv and the next, I'm on the edge of my seat, watching what will unfold next. The storyline is clever, each moment cleverly thought out to build a climax worthy of the classic 80's thriller movies. With excellent shots and dynamic camera work, this was easily a major upgrade from the usual fare from direct-to-TV movies.|0
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn ` t get to see the original teleplay untill a  few days ago. Seeing MESSIAH 2 and the original MESSIAH teleplay gave me a better perspective on the story, but also left me with an even greater appreciation for the hard work, vision and originality that must have gone into its creation. As someone who works in film and television, the entire experience of immersing myself in a classic piece of pop culture history has been an incredibly humbling experience, inspiring me to think outside of the box.|0
"First of all , ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans . Everyone is doing  it. If South Park is determined to stay relevant and remain unbiased then the best way to do this is to steer clear of politics as a whole. It’s easy to get caught up in a conversation or media cycle that is centered around who or what is ""right”. There are too many angles to analyze in a 21 minute episode anyway. Why not instead stay above the fray and talk about the characters themselves?"|0
"After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I  was thrilled to see she was the lead role in 

""Miracles of Life"". I absolutely fell in love with the plot! Meredith, who is deaf-mute, is moved to tears by the end of the film due to the powerful and tender relationship that grows between her and a disowned street urchin. I connected with the emotional yet challenging moments this movie portrayed in the protagonists’ journeys. Moreover, her sparkling charm kept me invested throughout, yearning to see where the plot leads next."|0
"An extremely down-to-earth , well made and acted `` Rodeo '' Western . No gussied up stars needed here as  every member of the cast conveyed his part's essence 

Ralph Moody once said ""Some Westerns seem false to me-rich, not so believable. I'm more interested in true stories and characters I could live with, learn from and use when they are dead"". This is exactly what is showcased in the movie “Rodeo” – which consists of a homegrown authenticity, giving viewers the impression they are a part of the local West Texan community."|0

As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50 's , along with  my pride and joy a set of sandstone ushabti figures. Visiting the collection in person, I was instantly taken aback by the history that these objects symbolise. Though its author is lost in time, I like to imagine who touched it throughout its years, who may have spoken a blessing or commanded by hieroglyph. Over time its once brightly polished alabaster faded, each finger that held it worn down ever so slightly over time to lend a timeworn personality.|0
As a European , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 's . It takes me back to the bustling nights spent out at small dance bars with live bands playing on the small stages, a drink in one hand and the warm embrace of my partner in the other. I remember the aroma of espresso rising from the local cafes with close friends exchanging stories, how truly fantastic those nights were! Even today, I love revisiting those nostalgic feelings through re-watching old favorite shows and movies.|0
Well.....I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVD's yet). Boy....was I surprised!!|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the Truth and Reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in developing the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions.|1
Fantastic documentary. A movie within a movie. I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation.|1
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom , which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds  and refreshed energy and reminded about several aspects. The show tackled everything from individual relationships, difficulties and personal freedoms with intelligence and wit, igniting minds from across all boundaries. From LGBTQ, racism and insecurities, Up and Coming unspooled delicate and multifaceted questions, serving as a lifeline of positive progress, heightened understanding and more defined levels of social values. The characters inspired this societal self reflection while growing in all the confusion and even strengthening one another.|0
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . Unforgiven takes on a somewhat real, although quite raw view on how life was lived back in the days. Even though, to most, its theme can be off-putting and relatively uncomfortable to digest, that's part of its appeal. Whereas, Tombstone boasts more over the top and frankly hilarious delivery, with occasional emotional depth thanks to many interesting and beautifully acted characters. From a loner driven to justice, to unforgettable performances like Doc Holiday and others.|0
Unfortunately , I 've never seen the full version of this movie . I did see the 87-minute version twice . After watching the shortened version I went looking for a version that ran the full 116-minutes. However I found no information about a release for the longer cut and gave up hope of seeing it in its entirety. After asking around for friends, acquaintances, family and teachers no one was familiar with this movie in either version. I’m truly amazed that the more expansive version was simply lost and never got the recognition it rightfully deserves.|0
"There's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing God's work. Yeah right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump, and Freddy Krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. He is Jacob Goodnight(WWE's Glen ""KANE"" Jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a Axe, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. That is totally methodical! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head."|1
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the Justin and Madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine, and accurate. The costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. I dearly love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American History, and I love movies about it.|1
comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.But like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality.|1
I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound  effect on me. From that moment on, I gained an entirely new perspective of how different stories have different messages behind them. For this movie, it touched on themes of living without judgement, of daring to love who you love, and even how society should not keep us from that love. For that reason, it has remained one of my all-time favourites and continues to give me life lessons in unique and surprising ways every time I revisit it.|0
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work.|1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about Black middle class families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many...many people who still talk about the show. If it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer-pressure and much more.|1
Usually , Alan Alda plays characters that are too `` soft '' and overly verbal -- it 's probably how  he got his nickname the '' cooperating communicator ''. Although the “cooperating communicator” label suits him well, Alan Alda is much more than that; he’s also very talented in tackling characters with layers and complexities, often showing hidden depths to their stories. From roles that allow him to showcase his adept emotional and comedic range, to historical roles requiring intense method acting research and dedication, Alan Alda continues to fascinate both veteran fans and newer audiences alike.|0
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store  

Since that day, I've watched it several times with family and friends. The storyline is so intriguing and creative; it really keeps you at the edge of your seat. What really fascinates me the most is the acting, each one did an impeccable job in each scene they appear in. Besides that, the way each characters transitions in and out of different situation; adding comical, suspenseful and inspiring events. All this combine into one inspiring, entertaining story that makes a memorable impression everytime you watch."|0
"This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest . In many ways , it can be thought of as an ""action comedy"" for its ability to blend both these genres. The protagonists make use of lots of humour, mixed in with innovative uses of wisecracks, further creating moments of hilarious laughter from the audience. The lead protagonists are presented to be humanly flawed, always falling into unlikely situations, setting themselves into very witty dialogues with each other, giving them more personalities, often making their situations rather eccentric."|0
* * SPOILERS AHEAD * * It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch  a letdown by the end of it. After the big reveal that Ted had died in his car crash, it all seemed a bit far fetched. There wasn't enough evidence in the movie to back up this conclusion which was almost comically unconvincing. Despite the fine performance of the main actor, a lack of investment in the character makes his death so unsatisfying. If a few more pieces of the puzzle were shown, maybe viewers would find more interest and emotion.|0
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm , wit , and charm . At age 16 Lorelai  became a single mom and since then we see Lorelai trying to raise her daughter right. She also had to juggle working multiple jobs , her daughter’s study schedule and maintaining her relations with her parents while being honest to her child and finding solutions that her parents’ approval. The amazing thing about Gilmore Girls is how effectively it strikes a balance between very different themes and conflicts. The Gilmore Girls foster loyalty, understanding and the power of kindness, which ensures the audience comes away with more than simply entertainment.|0
George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites . The unsung hero of his generation . Nobody  better knew how to frame a person , set a scene , and fill in the dramatic silence of a slow train going out of town . The expressions in Cukor's movies say so much without making an actor rely on anything other than themselves . It was all there before in the silence . He changed so much in that era, from romanticized glamorous nights out on the town to remote performances by young ingenues whose longing for tenderness could barely contain itself.|0
"I saw ""The Reader"" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat."|1
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film : Who are the crazy people ? The answer become less  and less clear as the story goes on. What are their objectives, why are they connected and what made them decide to partake in this strange journey? Even after learning more of their dark and twisted past, the film fails to fully address the numerous mysteries left behind by their individual acts and choices. It’s only during the surprise ending that hints are given as to what may have ultimately drawn these enigmatic personalities together.|0
"I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie ""Mighty Joe Young."" What attracted me to ""Wagon Master"" were the great songs sung by the ""Sons of the Pioneers."" Merian C. Cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong."|1
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ! I was not a  fan of the

lead actress but the scenes with her were very enjoyable to watch. Not only were the visuals in the film top-notch but I was thoroughly impressed by how incredibly well written and presented it was. In the end, it managed to deliver a powerful yet poignant message through laughter. Its staying power speaks volumes to me, and I can happily state that the characters of this classic comedy remain hilarious long after the credits roll."|0
With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing.|1
"This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, ""By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead? ""Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the ""Claw"" or Saw."|1
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer.|1
"*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it,I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her ""true love"" for a soap series character,Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film."|1
The `` Hunting Trilogy '' of Rabbit Fire ( 1951 ) , Rabbit Seasoning ( 1952 ) , and Duck  ! Rabbit, Duck! ( 1953 ) have all become essential watch list classics. This trilogy continues to influence, amaze, and impress new generations of viewers as each of these comedies stand as clear examples of iconic slapstick animation done perfectly. Following the trail of their predecessors, Looney Tunes' comedic style in these three cartoons further evolves and even give us a peak at the magic of taking an audience by surprise.|0
This is a really great film! It gets you thinking about your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as important, we should remember to open up and show them our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely see this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they will post my comment, how odd. Usually online comments need to be short short, and here I am being asked to write more!|1
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and more!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and ""starring"" KANE. WWE might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park ""sport"" and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT!!"|1
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised).|1
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.The first time I saw this, I cried from laughing so hard. Everything about it is funny.While ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by ""Real Genius""), it ranks way up there in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over Cary Elwes."|1
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight ( Midnight Cowboy , Coming Home )  has acted in, but the script was magnificent. The direction of the movie was captivating and Voight perfectly portrayed a brilliant role. Furthermore, the screenplay effectively highlighted Voight's human struggle by highlighting each raw emotion he feels while playing the lead character. The accompanying soundtrack effectively envelops the film to achieve its total purpose - capturing one man's search for redemption. Moreover, every performance, down to every last extra, oozed charisma, while crafting a complex story between this mixed melting pot of American citizen.|0
"In Mississippi , the former blues man Lazarus ( Samuel L. Jackson ) is in crisis , missing his wife , Stella 

As Stella’s life ebbs away from the lingering illness that gripped her body, Lazarus sits stoically in the Mississippi soil with head lowered in sorrow. To compound his sorrow further, no music was played, just heavy melancholy drags away the remaining chance of ever meeting Stella. Eventually, despite his immense internal struggle, Lazarus was able to come to terms with the fact he was being visited by loss in more ways than he knew how to control."|0
"Having just got the ""Loony Tunes Golden Collection""(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.Rabbit Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being ""Rabbit Fire"" and ""Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and Daffy argue about who Elmer Fudd should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!"|1
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west. John Ford's stock of character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent James Arness, a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train.|1
I wanted to watch this , to get a inside look at the show . It told the story more  effectively. As I watched, I was astonished at how masterfully put together the show was, even without much dialogue. From the impeccable attention to detail and selection of music, to the striking shots that moved the story along, every aspect was thoughtfully assembled. I soon discovered why this show had attained the critical acclaim that it had— it had mastered the art of story telling through filmmaking. What was especially unique was its creative use of nonlinear storytelling that caught viewers by surprise as the episodes progressed.|0
Whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. The story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. The storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie.|1
15 Park Avenue , well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in  this address . 15 Park Avenue has gained popularity from movies, TV shows and celebrities throughout the years, making the address world famous. The mystery behind the famous address dates back to 19th century when the the glamorous New York's high society set trend for the location of many unique upscale residences. 15 Park Avenue quickly caught on to become a familiar icon not just within the USA but also from foreign celebrities alike.|0
